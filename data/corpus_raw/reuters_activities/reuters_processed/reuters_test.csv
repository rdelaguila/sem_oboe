  Selm-Societa Energia Montedison is to
  close its Priolo crude refining units from March 15th to March
  28th for maintenance, a company spokesman said.
      Throughput at the refinery is currently estimated at
  140-150,000 bpd, although total capacity is nearer 200,000 bpd.
      Several other Mediterranean refineries are currently
  shutdown for maintenance, most of which were scheduled some
  months ago. But industry sources said that shutdowns may have
  been rearranged to avoid running negative-netback crude.
       Tighter availabilities of products as a result of the 
  shutdowns in the Med is helping to keep products markets
  bullish, particularly for March deliveries, oil traders said.
      Garrone's refinery at San Quirico (capacity 130,000 bpd) is
  due to shutdown on March 14th for three weeks, and the
  jointly-owned ISAB/Garrone refinery at Mellili, capacity
  220,000 bpd, is due to start up around March 20-25th following
  its closure for maintenance a month ago, a company spokesman
  said.
      The Esso Italiana refineries at Augusta and Siracusa will
  not be closing this spring, a spokesman for the company said.
      In France, the distillation unit at Societe Francaise de
  BP's Lavera refinery has been closed for maintenance since
  March 2, and is due to restart early April. Total capacity is
  181,900 bpd. It is currently operating at around 50 pct
  capacity, a company spokesman said.
      Shell Francaise's Berre l'Etang refinery will shut down in
  early April until mid-June, a company spokesman said. Capacity
  is around 150,000 bpd. Compagnie Francaise de Raffinage (CFR)
  will close the visbreaker at its La Mede refinery in early
  April, but would not affect crude throughput at the refinery, a
  company spokesman said. Current capacity is 136,000 bbl/day.
      Despite current bullish sentiment in the Med, however,
  traders noted that crude netbacks are beginning to look more
  attractive, and most maintenance shutdowns should be finished
  in two to three weeks.
      As a result, oil industry sources suggest that the
  situation may ease by mid-April.

  A senior British official said that
  protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger
  retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the
  global trading system.
      Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if
  Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which
  would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian
  textile producers, ""the community would have to retaliate.""
      His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade
  Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the
  community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.
      Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two
  days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members
  of Congress.
      De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.
      Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in
  Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the
  Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade
  deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.
      Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to
  force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.
      Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone
  problems - its surplus with the United States last year was
  51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.
      ""The more united pressure there could be, the better,"" he
  said.
      Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to
  avoid trade disputes.
      He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation
  earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and
  Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports
  regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.
      ""But if both sides drew back from the brink that time,"" he
  said, """"it does not mean that they would do so on another
  occasion.""
      Channon added that ""There is increasing reesentment in
  Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure
  of unilaterally imposed deadlines.""
      He said other potential conflicts are already in sight -
  alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and
  taxes on fats and oils - and ""the commuity and the United States
  must therefore learn to manage their relations better.""
      He said another bill to let the United States retaliate
  against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S.
  goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on
  Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.
      He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not
  by the United States, adding ""if the (trade) law is to be
  interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is
  to happen to the rest of us?""

  The Philippine 1987 inflation rate will
  rise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the government
  implements an employers' association recommendation for a 10
  pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month,
  Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said.
      The government's own proposal for an across-the-board daily
  pay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eight
  pesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year average
  higher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week.
      The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by the
  Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP).
      The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflation
  rate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4
  pct if the government's recommendation is implemented, Solita
  said. Both were proposed last month.
      Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pct
  by the National Economic and Development Authority early this
  month.
      In the first three months of the year, inflation was a
  negative 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 pct respectively, rising to 1.0, 2.5
  and 4.6 pct in April May and June, the National Statistics
  Office said.
      The annual inflation rate rose to 5.8 pct in June, 6.2 pct
  in July and 6.15 and 6.188 pct in August and September
  respectively, the National Statistics Office said.
      It attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and water
  prices.
      The government's six and eight peso wage increases would
  displace up to 20,000 workers, Monsod said, bringing the number
  of unemployed to 4.2 mln or 19.2 pct of the population.

  Jorge Cardenas, manager of Colombia's

  the International Coffee Organization (ICO).
      The ICO executive board is set to meet in London from March
  31 and could decide to call a special council session by the
  end of April to discuss export quotas.
      ""It's going to be a routine meeting, an update of what has
  been happening in the market, but it's unlikely any major
  decisions are taken,"" Cardenas told journalists.
      Earlier this month, talks in London to re-introduce export

      Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria, also talking to
  reporters at the end of the weekly National Coffee Committee
  meeting, said the positions of Brazil and of the United States
  were too far apart to allow a prompt agreement on quotas.
      Brazil's coffee chief Jorio Dauster said yesterday Brazil
  would not change its coffee policies.
      Cardenas said the market situation was getting clearer
  because the trade knew the projected output and stockpile

  2.0 mln below last year's harvest, the U.S. Agriculture

      Imports from the United States are estimated at 1.5 mln

      The report said to compensate for the below normal

      While there are pockets where irrigation is not possible,
  most of the wheat crop has access to some water and therefore

  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul

      ""There is clearly a danger that adequate financing

  The five leading West German economic
  research institutes said the government should do more to
  stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of
  tax cuts planned for 1990.
      In their joint spring report the institutes were divided
  about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct
  expansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross national
  product grew 2.4 pct last year.
      But the report said all the institutes believed that ""more
  must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional
  jobs can be created.""
      The institutes said any step which improved basic economic
  conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. ""From this
  point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be
  brought forward.""
      The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion
  marks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from
  the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.
      However, the institutes criticised the government, not only
  for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of
  its financing had been left open.
      The government has not specified how the remaining 19
  billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,
  though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.
      The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had
  caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what
  exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a
  quick decision from the government.
      They also said the government should reduce tax
  preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a
  restriction of state spending and called for no increase in
  value-added tax.
      The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing
  subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.
      They referred specifically to a doubling of special
  writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a
  package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this
  as an increase in subsidies.
      The institutes said total subsidies, including tax
  preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen
  further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it
  should be possible ""despite ... Major political difficulties"" to
  finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.
      The institutes said that if the government raised value
  added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the
  positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.
      The report also noted that the government was progressing
  only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and
  said more deregulation was needed. The government had to aim
  for more competition, it said.

      Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987

  chief executive officer said.
      Earlier, the company reported first quarter earnings of
  34.2 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share, versus 20.3 mln dlrs, or
  65 cts a share, in last year's first quarter.
      In 1986 the company reported earnings from continuing
  operations of 109.3 mln dlrs, or 3.50 dlrs a share.
      Mead said its first quarter benefitted from stronger market
  conditions and improved operations.
      ""The combination of capital improvement programs and more
  employee involvement has been paying off throughout our paper
  operations,"" Roberts said.
      He added that Mead's pulp and paperboard businesses are
  operating well as prices have improved and strong demand has
  placed most products in a sold-out position through the middle
  of the year.
      Mead said sales of its unbleached coated paperboard was
  particularly strong, up 13 pct versus the first quarter 1986.

  a statement.
      It said all other conditions remain unchanged from the

      These conditions are that offers from registered companies
  should be in pounds sterling for cocoa beans for which standard
  differentials have been set in the ICCO's buffer stock rules,
  and can be for cocoa afloat through to December shipment and
  spot to December arrival/delivery.
      The basis position will be afloat, May/July shipment or
  June arrival/delivery. For later positions the appropriate
  carrying costs will be taken into account.
      The deadline for the receipt of offers by the manager shall
  be 1330 hrs london time (1230 gmt) in the case of offers
  emanating from the secondhand market and 1400 hours in the case
  of offers emanating from the origins.
      The competitiveness of offers will be assessed by taking
  into account the standard differentials, the cost of taking
  cocoa into store (currently 23.00 pounds sterling from ""cif

  A British minister said he had given the

  return from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese were
  beginning to appreciate the need to be ""fair and open"" about
  access to their own markets.
      At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition
  charges that his trip had been a failure because he had
  returned empty-handed.
      ""I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clear

      Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the
  govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions
  against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in
  Britain.
      ""It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing
  operating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries
  from carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing
  them to carry out other kinds.""
      ""I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made it
  clear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall use
  them.""
      He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became
  involved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gained
  more than anyone else from an open trading relationship.
      ""I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this
  relationship is to continue, it is very important for them to
  be fair and open about access to their own markets.""
      On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc
  &lt;CAWL.L>, which is trying to win a significant share of
  telecommunications contracts in Japan, Howard said he had told
  the Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case.
      He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and
  Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday,
  he said.
      Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher

  A major animal feed producer, Cehave
  NV Veghel (CHV), has begun legal proceedings against the
  application of the European Community grain co-responsibility
  levy, with the full backing of the Dutch animal grain and feed
  trade association, Het Comite, association chief executive
  Peter Pex told Reuters.
      Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and the
  court said it would give its verdict within six weeks. ""However,
  that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court to
  refer questions on the interpretation and application of the
  levy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg,"" Pex added.
      Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not take
  account of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean a
  compounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy in
  its own national currency than it received down the chain from
  the original producer of the grain.
      ""We would like the Business Administration Court in the
  Hague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whether
  the Dutch Grain Commodity Board, the levy collection agency,
  has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but also
  whether the regulations themselves may contravene European law,""
  Pex said.
      ""It is only with great regret that we have taken this route,
  but we have had no political help, and therefore have no option
  even though it could take years,"" Pex added.
      Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against the
  grain levy because the bill the company received from the
  commodity board included grain from a wide variety of origins
  and was therefore considered to be the best general basis for a
  legal challenge to the levy, Pex noted.
      Het Comite's actions will run in tandem with questions on
  the levy already posed to the Luxembourg Court in a case
  brought by the Association of European Animal Feed
  Manufacturers, FEFAC.

  Physio Technology Inc said it
  expects to have a third quarter, ended March 31, loss of about
  200,000 dlrs and is in default on its bank loan because of the
  resignation of chairman and chief executive officer.
      The company said the loss followed four quarters of modest
  profits. In the year ago quarter it earned 11,000 dlrs, or one
  cent a share. For the first half of fiscal 1987, it reported a
  profit of 42,000 dlrs, or two cts a share, compared to a year
  earlier loss of 294,000 dlrs, or 17 cts a share.
      It said President Michael R. Hall will assume the duties of
  chief executive officer.
      Physio Technology said the resignation of Chairman James C.
  Lane can constitute non-compliance with its Series A
  convertible subordinated debentures due 1996 and a default
  under its agreement with the Merchants Bank of Kansas City.
      It explained a declaration of non-compliance under the
  debentures would create a a default under the loan agreements
  requiring immediate payment of 1.8 mln dlrs of debentures and
  about 450,000 dlrs outstanding under the bank credit line.
      The company said the debenture holders intend to waive the
  non-compliance, but reserve the right to withdraw the waiver at
  the end of any 30 day period.
      Physio Technology said it is changing its field sales force
  to independent representatives and dealers from employees to
  ""significantly reduce its fixed overhead.""
      Its statement did not indicate how many employees would be
  affected by the move.
      The company said Lane will become an independent dealter
  for the company in certain midwestern states. He will continue
  to serve as a director, it added.

  Indonesia appears to be nearing a
  political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected
  economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.
      To counter falling oil revenues, the government has
  launched a series of measures over the past nine months to
  boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new
  investment.
      Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading
  primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year""s
  fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its
  currency by 31 pct in September.
      But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto""s
  government appears to be divided over what direction to lead
  the economy.
      ""(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to
  deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,""
  the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia""s agricultural
  sector, but also reviews the country""s general economic
  performance.
      It says that while many government officials and advisers
  are recommending further relaxation, ""there are equally strong
  pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.""
      ""This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,""
  the report says.
      Indonesia""s economic changes have been welcomed by the World
  Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction,
  though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and
  steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.
      Three sets of measures have been announced since last May,
  which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade
  restrictions and liberalised imports.
      The report says Indonesia""s economic growth in calendar 1986
  was probably about zero, and the economy may even have
  contracted a bit. ""This is the lowest rate of growth since the
  mid-1960s,"" the report notes.
      Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a
  population of 168 million, is facing general elections in
  April.
      But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement
  in the economic outlook. ""For 1987 early indications point to a
  slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic
  activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export
  earnings from the petroleum industry.""
      ""Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak
  domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real
  declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of
  growth in agriculture,"" the report states.
      Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is
  crucial for the government to get the international lending its
  needs.
      A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance
  of payments support was given partly to help the government
  maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.

  Financial analysts say they are
  pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal
  budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help
  improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.
      The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow
  to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming
  fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.
      Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan
  that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next
  year.
          ""In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is
  infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little
  impact on the economy and the trade deficit,"" said Stanley
  Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.
      ""At best, it will have a small positive effect,"" Collander
  said in an interview.
      Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly
  told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way
  to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease
  some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.
      The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade
  imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker
  has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught
  with danger.
      Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as
  imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign
  capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.
      In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other
  major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of
  the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates
  should be stabilized at around current levels.
      As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to
  take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States
  agreed to cut its budget deficit.
      The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a
  way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is
  to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.
      ""If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else
  you do is going to be counterproductive,"" Volcker said in recent
  testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
      Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the
  government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit
  supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or
  to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United
  States.
      Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the
  current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.
      Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed
  that any deficit reduction was better than none.
      But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were 
  not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it
  needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar
  from plunging further in world exchange markets.
      ""There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if
  your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the
  Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer
  is, it's not enough,"" Silvia told Reuters.
      The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's
  most vexing and persistent problems.
      The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet
  little indication that this year's figure will be any lower,
  though administration officials have predicted it will drop by
  about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.
      In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep
  worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the
  federal budget.
      On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not
  attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for
  the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced
  budget law.
      While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for
  next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget
  Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall
  short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.
      ""For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the
  most you're going to get"" out of Congress at the present time,
  said Touche Ross's Collander. ""To do something more than that
  would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.""
      Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up
  short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.
      ""To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable
  reduction level,"" he explained. ""Anything less than that will now
  look like a failure to Wall Street.""
      The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would
  lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year
  beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting
  defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their
  anticipated spending levels for next year.
      The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of
  nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new 
  taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.

  Oil prices would skyrocket for a time if
  conflict in the Gulf closed the Strait of Hormuz, but oil
  supplies could be adjusted to take care of world demand,
  Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said.
      He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Military
  action in the Gulf.
      But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian
  Petroleum Association, he said, ""If worst comes to worst and say
  the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely
  shut off, I believe the world oil supply, given time to adjust,
  can take care of the situation.""
      ""But this is not to say that prices, at least for a short
  duration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of
  the situation,"" he declared.
      Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relatively
  short-term impact on prices, he added.
      Assessing future price trends, he said, ""Short-term spot
  prices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likely
  hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per
  barrel.
      ""The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greater
  than the downward ones.""
      ""The balance between supply and demand in the short term
  will still be delicate,"" he added. ""Non-Opec production may still
  go up, competing with Opec for the expected additional increase
  in world demand.""
      Subroto, a member of Opec's three-man quota committee which
  has been touring cartel members, said speculation may play
  havoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize the
  situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers.
      In the medium term, non-Opec production would reach a
  plateau in the early 1990s, leaving Opec much stronger, he
  said.

  ethylene, by an average 7.7 percentage points in order to check
  inflation.

  the financial burden of the North-West Shelf gas project.

      But Opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis told reporters
  he thought the suspension would be temporary until the crisis
  is resolved. A U.S. Defence Department official in Washington

      Greek newspapers reported that the Greek army, navy and air

      But there was no official word on military movements apart
  from a comment by the government spokesman that the Greek navy
  was no longer in port.
      The United States, NATO and the United Nations all called
  on Greece and Turkey to exercise restraint.
      Greek U.N. Representative Mihalis Dounas said in a letter

  The grain output of a major Chinese
  grain-producing province is not increasing, because farmers
  lack incentives, production costs are rising, storage
  facilities are poor and there is not enough state investment in
  grain, the province's vice-governor said.
      The China Daily quoted Yang Jike, vice-governor of Anhui,
  as saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton as
  they could growing grain, and three times as much growing cash
  crops like flax. He said production costs had risen to 40 pct
  of farmers' earnings, from 20 pct in 1982, and lower investment
  had caused the area of irrigated land to fall.
      Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pct
  of the province's total investment, from 26 pct in 1978.
      He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain was
  hit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year, and a
  further 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats.
      He said government measures to deal with the problem dealt
  with trifles, rather than the essentials. He called for more
  investment in grain production, an immediate ban on illegal use
  of or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called the
  tendency to rely on grain imports.
      The New China News Agency quoted Zhang Yan, a delegate to
  the National People's Congress, attacking grain policy. He said
  the government had cut agricultural investment to three to four
  pct from 11 pct.
      ""With the abundance of grain and cotton in the past few
  years, some people got carried away, relaxing their attention
  to grain and cotton production,"" he said.
      On Saturday, vice-premier Tian Jiyun said China aimed to be
  self-sufficient in grain. Now it exports corn from the
  northeast, but it imports wheat.
      ""Grain consumption is rising every year. Even if we reach
  the 1987 target of (405 mln tonnes), it cannot be considered
  adequate,"" Tian said.

  The West Texas cotton crop was largely
  unscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last night
  that packed hurricane-force winds, crop and weather experts
  said.
      ""There might have been some isolated storms, but certainly
  nothing damaging,"" said Charles Stichler, an extension
  agronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far West
  Texas.
      Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the New
  York cotton futures market rally sharply this morning.
     Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95
  cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25
  cents.
      ""What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, and
  when that happens, everybody sees it,"" said Dale Mohler, a
  senior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc.
      Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, which
  produces about 80 pct of that state's crop.
      The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. ""That's hurricane
  force. But they were isolated to just a small portion of the
  West Texas area, probably less than five pct,"" Mohler said.
      ""No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in July
  or August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have been
  worse,"" Mohler said.
      About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has been
  planted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend if
  weather remains hot and dry, Stichler said.
      The temperature in West Texas since mid-week has been about
  95 degrees. But a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavier
  than normal rainfall for several weeks, he said.

  U.S. scientists said some tropical
  vegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is at
  risk because of high levels of saturated fat, lending weight to
  a campaign by the American Soybean Association (ASA) for
  labelling changes.
      The scientists appeared to support an ASA charge, denied by
  Malaysian palm growers, that imported coconut, palm and palm
  kernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raise
  blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.
      In a petition filed in January, the ASA asked the U.S. Food
  and Drug Administration (FDA) to require palm, palm kernel and
  coconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on food
  manufacturers' labels.
      The FDA responded to the ASA in a letter saying it would
  consider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealing
  with cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods.
      Malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the ASA
  that palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol and
  contributes to heart disease are untrue.
      But Steve Chang, Professor of Food Science at Rutgers
  University, said, ""Palm oil is definitely not good for human
  health because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid.""
      He added that the higher the fatty acid, the greater the
  blood cholesterol level. ""It has been well established that
  high cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heart
  disease,"" he said.
      A Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Council official, Borge
  Bek-Nielsen, has said studies have shown that palm oil is
  cholesterol-free, low in saturated fats, has anti-cancer
  properties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteries
  in humans.
      Bek-Nielsen said Americans consume more saturated fats
  daily through food like butter, bacon, ham and beef than from
  palm oil, which, he added is rich in vitamins A and E.
      David Kritchevsky, Associate Director of the Wistar
  Institute in Philadelphia, appeared to take the ASA view on
  labelling. ""What people really have to learn is to read labels,""
  said Kritchevsky. ""The more a consumer knows, the more likely he
  will make an intelligent choice.""
      The U.S. scientists said they had no doubt imported palm,
  palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels.
      Kritchevsky, a specialist in nutrition, said, ""More
  saturated fat would raise cholesterol levels...So, from that
  point of view it's a health risk. High cholesterol levels in
  the blood are a risk factor for heart disease.""
      Susanne Harris, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S.
  Agriculture Department's Food and Consumer Services Division,
  said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils with
  high saturated fat levels was highest among those who have
  heart disease.
      The scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acid
  content of the tropical oils was saturated, whereas less than
  20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated.
      David Ericksen, director of ASA's technical services, said
  U.S. soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273
  mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumers
  were aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat.
      Imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of U.S.
  soybean sales in the U.S. market, ASA estimates.
      U.S. imports of coconut oil during January totaled 82.9 mln
  lbs compared with 48.0 mln lbs in December and 106.5 mln a year
  earlier, according to Commerce Department figures.
      Imports of palm oil totaled 44.0 mln lbs compared with 51.3
  mln lbs in December and 85.2 mln a year earlier.

  Visible stocks of 17 oils and fats are
  probably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by October
  1 this year, the Oil World newsletter said.
      Oil World forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cut
  to only 9.8 mln tonnes at the end of this season, compared with
  10.6 mln a year earlier.
      Its survey covered  13 oils -- soy, cotton, groundnut, sun,
  rape, sesame, corn, olive, coconut, palmkernel, palm, lin and
  castor  -- and four animal oils and fats -- butter, fish oil,
  lard and tallow/greases.
      Oil World's analysis predicted only a slight production
  increase of 0.5 mln tonnes in the year to end-September 1987,
  compared with increases of 3.6 mln and 4.0 mln tonnes in the
  previous two seasons.
      It said world consumption was continuing to rise. Unusually
  low prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demand
  for both food and non-food purposes, it said.
      World consumption  could increase by a record 2.8 mln
  tonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higher
  if the Indian government did not artificially curb domestic
  demand.
      Oil World said it did not expect the European Community
  (EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax, but if such a tax were
  introduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption.

      For the 12 months ended in February, the CPI rose an
  unadjusted 2.1 pct.
      Transportation prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5
  pct increase in January. Smaller price rises for motor fuels
  and declines in new car prices and finance charges were
  responsible for the moderation.
      Gasoline prices rose 4.2 pct last month after increasing
  6.6 pct in January, but were still 18 pct below levels of a

      Housing prices rose 0.4 pct in February after a 0.5 pct
  January increase, largely due to a rise in fuel oil prices.
      Fuel oil prices were up 4.4 pct in February after
  increasing 9.8 pct in January, but were still 15 pct below
  price levels of February 1986.
      Food prices rose 0.2 pct last month after a 0.5 pct January

  as in January, but meat, poultry, fish and eggs cost less for a
  third consecutive month, the department said.
      Medical care rose 0.3 pct in February to a level 7.1 pct
  above one year ago, because of higher costs for prescription
  and non-prescription drugs and medical supplies, the department
  said.
      The index for apparel and upkeep rose 0.7 pct in February
  after a 0.4 pct increase in January. The department said the
  introduction of higher priced spring merchandise, particularly
  men's clothing, was responsible for the advance.
      Prices for other goods and services rose 0.7 pct in
  February following a 1.1 pct increase in January. Tobacco

  Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> is certain to
  lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of
  its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.
      Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9
  trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank
  with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in
  October.
      But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu
  told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its
  position.
      ""We'll be back in position in first place within three
  years,"" Komatsu said in an interview.
      He said that while the merger will initially reduce
  Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand
  Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where
  it has been relatively weak.
      But financial analysts are divided on whether and how
  quickly the gamble will pay off.
      Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in
  view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger
  was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch
  network from scratch.
      The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has
  expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business
  and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the
  wisdom of some of those moves.
      ""They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now
  it's largely out of their hands,"" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd
  financial analyst Simon Smithson.
      Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to
  enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American
  investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.
      Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5
  pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at
  least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange
  personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.
      ""The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the
  Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,"" said one analyst.
      But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.
      ""U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,
  we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three
  years, not until the 21st century,"" Komatsu said.
      Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes
  into the securities business at home.
      Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's
  version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial
  from investment banking.
      But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu
  said he hopes further deregulation will create new
  opportunities.
      ""We need to find new business chances,"" Komatsu said. ""In some
  cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust
  bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.""
      Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such
  domestic securities business as profitable government bond
  dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co
  Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.
      He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering
  the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank
  subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.
       The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to
  securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,
  following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European
  universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.
      But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar
  decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.
      ""We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed
  in two or three years,"" he said.
      Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand
  lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to
  replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.
      The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of
  time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the
  merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.
      ""It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,"" said
  Kleinwort's Smithson.
      ""After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling
  around. It will be the next decade before we see if the
  strategy is right or wrong.""

  Top executives with Tenneco Corp &lt;TGT>
  and Sabine Corp &lt;SAB> said they expected world oil prices to
  gradually increase over the next two years as U.S. reliance on
  imports of oil from the Middle East grows.
       ""I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to a
  trend of gradually increasing prices,"" C.W. Nance, president of
  Tenneco Oil Exploration and Production, told a meeting of the
  Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association.
       Nance predicted that by 1990, the Organization of
  Producing and Exporting Countries would be producing at the
  rate of 80 pct of capacity.
      The gain will come largely through increased imports to the
  United States, he said.
      ""They will be able to raise the price again but I do not
  think they will raise it as much as they did in 1979,"" Nance
  said. He did not say how much of a price hike he expected.
       Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predicted
  that world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20
  dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in
  1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climb
  from a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between
  1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988.
       ""Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in
  increased demand,"" Shoup said, referring to the gas industry's
  outlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal law
  prohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants
  and utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15
  pct, he said.
       Tenneco's Nance also said that some U.S. cities may
  experience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next
  winter because of the industry's reduced deliverability.
       Tenneco's gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20
  pct during 1986, he said.
       ""This does not mean the gas bubble is gone,"" Nance said.
  ""We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question is
  how broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or three
  years before we start to climb out?""
        J.C. Walter of &lt;Walter Oil and Gas Corp>, said the recent
  improvement in oil prices was not enough for independent
  producers to begin new onshore drilling projects.
       ""If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlr
  per mcf for natural gas prevails, the prospects for onshore
  exploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by
  independents in the 1990s are pretty dismal,"" Walter said.
       He suggested that some independents may instead turn to
  exploration in shallow federal offshore leases. Farm-out
  agreements, cheap rig rates and less competition have held
  finding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel,
  Walter said.

  Following is the text of a statement
  by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,

  yesterday.
      1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of
  seven major industrial countries met today.
      They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of
  their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened
  economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of
  their heads of state or government.
      The managing director of the International Monetary Fund
  also participated in the meeting.
      2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to
  the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,
  and noted the progress achieved in implementing the
  undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.
      They agreed, however, that further actions will be
  essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
  global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.
      In this connection they welcomed the proposals just
  announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan
  for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's
  economy through early implementation of a large supplementary
  budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as
  unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
      The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further
  open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.
      3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that
  around current levels their currencies are within ranges
  broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic
  policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.
      In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation
  of the Louvre Agreement.
      They concluded that present and prospective progress in
  implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this
  statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to
  foster the stability of exchange rates.

  said the United States would go ahead with planned 300 mln dlr

      He said in a speech to an export-import group that he was

  but ""I am sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out.""
      Sanctions are to be imposed on April 17.
      He also said he did not think there would be a trade war
  with Japan, because Japan had too much value in exports to the
  United States to risk such a war.
      ""Those fears are unfounded,"" he said.
      He told reporters later that the sharp drop in the
  securities market was not due to fears of a trade war, but fear
  of inflation and that the Federal Reserve may act on that fact.
      Market reaction was also due, he said, to the drop in the
  value of the dollar, although trade issues did have some
  effect.
      Baldrige said that observers who were attributing the drop

  Latest consumer price data indicate
  U.S. inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will be
  above last year's pace, economists said.
      ""Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this time
  last year, but it's not building up a large head of steam,""
  said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.
      U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the consumer price
  index for all urban consumers, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4
  pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain. Energy prices,
  which fired January's data with a three pct rise, advanced a
  more moderate 1.9 pct last month.
      The CPI came within the range of economists' expectations
  and had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets.
      Among the key components of the report, transportation
  prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gain
  reflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels and
  declines in new car prices and finance charges.
      ""There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,""
  said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
      Economists said the latest CPI supports existing
  expectations for an inflation rate of 3.5 to four pct in 1987.
      The CPI rose 1.1 pct from December 1985 to December 1986.
  Without last year's energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct.
      Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as a
  result of the dollar's drop as well as the volatile energy
  component warrant attention in case gains in these areas become
  factored into the wider economic picture.
      ""As long as those price rises do not become entrenched in
  cost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thus
  reducing international competitiveness, then the Federal
  Reserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pct
  inflation,"" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.

      ""The mood of the Congress right now is as tough on trade as

  Four U.S. meat processors have asked
  the federal government to relax a labelling requirement which
  they said discourages the use of mechanically separated meat,
  the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co,
  Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allow
  mechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels as
  the species from which it was derived.
      For example, ""pork"" would be listed on the ingredients
  statement instead of ""mechanically separated pork.""
      Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat product
  would have to be stated on the label and the mechanically
  separated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meat
  and poultry portion of the product.
      Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-cost
  product that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said.
      Current regulations allow use of mechanically separated
  ingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultry
  product, but require it to be listed in the ingredient
  statement as ""mechanically separated (species),"" USDA said.
      USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoid
  using mechanically separated meat in their products because the
  term carries an ""unwarranted negative connotation"" in the minds
  of many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similar
  regulation exists for poultry products.
      Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcass
  parts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have some
  remaining meat, into specialized processing equipment.

  quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500
  tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will
  be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.
      Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of
  5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced
  levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.
      The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said
  that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their
  exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They
  have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement
  on Tariffs and Trade).
      But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve
  Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had
  been affected by the country's EC membership.
      Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the
  fish dispute with Canada.
      Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC
  claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has
  improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied
  with Japanese offers of compensation.
      Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on
  citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some
  other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear
  and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.
      EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told
  journalists: ""We maintain our position that the (Japanese)
  concessions were not enough.""
      ""We hope that there will be an improvement,"" he said.

  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's
  forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will
  almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be
  surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.
      The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'
  Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal
  Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or
  end-of-season stocks.
      However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end
  1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln
  was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.
      The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast
  in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for
  soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and
  the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.
      This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around
  31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of
  Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares
  against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.
      ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign
  will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC
  official said.
      Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to
  estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and
  to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.
      He said, however, that among countries to which France
  could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb
  countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.
      The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in
  1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,
  was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize
  Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.
      Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were
  expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.
      It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,
  down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.

  Borg-Warner &lt;BOR> Corp, facing an
  unwanted offer from GAF Corp &lt;GAF>, agreed to a 4.23 billion
  dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by &lt;Merrill Lynch
  Capital Partners Inc>.
      Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a
  definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the
  new company, &lt;AV Holdings Corp>, will begin a 48.50 dlr per
  share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of
  Borg-Warner common stock.
      The offer will be followed by a merger in which each
  remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and
  54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated
  discount debentures.
      As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly
  owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said
  members of management do not plan to participate in the
  transaction, but they will retain their positions with the
  company.
      A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds
  19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares.
      GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share.
      Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to
  sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo
  security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
      Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for
  about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed
  a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the
  stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup
  values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and
  speculated an offer would have to be sweetened.
      In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the
  Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their
  shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its
  advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co.
      James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,
  said, ""We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction
  with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the
  employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its
  strong presence in the Chicago community.""
      Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer,
  which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject
  to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing
  arrangements.
      The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or
  51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered.
      Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to
  provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in
  subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments.
      Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with
  commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the
  financing required to complete the transaction.
      The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in
  the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying
  cash interest after five years.
      The debentures will be redeemable at the company's option
  for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at
  102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.
      The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity
  of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in
  the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before
  maturity.
      Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50
  dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per
  share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first
  convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock.
      The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its
  poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right,
  effective immediately.

  The White House has completed a new

  April should be lifted, U.S. officials said.
      They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked at

  yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.

  U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt 
  Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not
  taking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.
      Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for
  Japan's failure to honor commitments to end dumping
  semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs
  and to open its own market to U.S. goods.
      The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese television

      He said Costa Rica would press for quotas ""based on the

  Wheat and rapeseed crops in east China
  suffered considerable damage because of frost during a spell of
  unusually cold weather in late March, the China Daily said.
      It said average temperatures for the last 10 days of March
  in most of east China were three to five degrees centigrade
  below average. Snow fell in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei and Henan,
  making early rice sowing difficult.
      Heavy snow blanketted central and south Jilin and north
  Liaoning, leaving farmland too muddy for spring ploughing and
  sowing, the paper said.
      The paper said rainfall during the last 10 days of March in
  areas south of the Yangtze had been much higher than normal.
      Heavy rain fell last Sunday in parts of Guangdong, ending a
  particularly arid dry season and marking the start of the flood
  season, it said. It gave no further details.
      The New China News Agency said rain and snow in Henan had
  improved the prospects for wheat, sown on 4.8 mln hectares, and
  caused a drop in grain prices at rural fairs since late
  February. It gave no 1986 figures for comparison.

  Indonesia rejected World Bank
  recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
  the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
  billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
      Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks
  distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
  at The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bank
  for this free trade, open economy view is weak.""
      The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
  largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
  growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.
      The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
  and the subsidies are a waste of money.
      Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
  an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
  needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
  exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
  assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
      Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
  should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
  government would continue to maintain production targets for
  ""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.
      The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
  drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
  the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
  would save money by importing the commodity.
      However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
  to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
  industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
      He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
  agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
  develop and because of ""over-production and price intervention
  in the developed nations.""

  South Africa is expected to unveil
  tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year
  in a bid to boost the nation's flagging economic growth rate,
  economic analysts said.
      Faced with competing demands for increased military and
  police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black
  housing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is
  expected to raise significantly the government's overall
  expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament,
  the analysts said.
      Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state
  spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the
  financial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleas
  from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes.
      ""Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, but
  simply raising government spending and increasing the budget
  deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation,"" said Rob Lee,
  chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co.
      South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted
  growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of
  less than one pct.
      Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5
  pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to
  over 30 pct.
      Economists estimate that the government's spending target
  will rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted at
  around 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficit
  before borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of
  GDP.
      The government, having consistently overshot its own
  spending targets for more than a decade, also faces a
  credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the
  budget, analysts said.
      ""The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,""
  said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.
      Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less
  attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using
  their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the
  money and capital markets.
      South African Mutual's Lee believes government spending
  will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49
  billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5
  pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the
  IMF.
      ""The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,"" predicted
  one analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away
  from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past
  two years.
      The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the
  political situation and the onset of an economic crisis
  triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over
  loans to the country in September 1985.
      Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling
  per capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,
  government officials say economic growth is the prime
  objective.
      But private-sector economists caution that the government's
  ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is
  constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the
  current account of the country's balance of payments.
      Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5
  billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the
  nation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an
  arrangement reached earlier this year with major international
  creditor banks.
      Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has
  little room to manoeuvre.
      Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and
  budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and
  South African Transport Services suggest that major tax
  concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.
      Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions
  for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only
  election. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget.
      ""This will not be a very exciting budget,"" commented Harry
  Schwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive
  Federal Party. ""I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the
  sweets were given out before the election.""

  A scheme to distribute surplus food
  free to the poor in the European Community (EC), which was due
  to expire next Tuesday, will be partially extended for a
  further month, an EC Commission spokesman said.
      He added the executive Commission has not yet decided
  whether the scheme should become a permanent feature of the
  EC's struggle to find a use for its massive stocks of farm
  produce.
      Almost 60,000 tonnes of cereals, sugar, beef, butter and
  other food have been authorised for distribution under an
  operation sanctioned by EC farm ministers on January 20 in
  which charities act as executive Commission agents.
      The original idea was to help the needy survive this year's
  unusually cold European winter.
      The spokesman said the Commission was extending the scheme
  fully in Greece, which has recently been hit by unseasonal
  snowstorms, for the month of April.
      Other EC countries would be authorised to use stocks of
  food for which they have already applied under the scheme up to
  April 30. The spokesman said this would enable distribution of
  flour, semolina, sugar and olive oil at a relatively high rate
  next month.
      He said the Commission, which has powers to continue most
  aspects of the scheme without consulting ministers further,
  will be considering soon whether it should be made permanent.
      Cost, which has already reached around 65 mln European
  currency units, would be a major consideration.
      End-January stocks included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter,
  520,000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals.

  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a
  global farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although the
  United States opposes key parts of the proposal.
      ""We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal.
  It will help us in getting the negotiations underway,"" Lyng
  told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.
      Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg
  endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission.
  The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay
  round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.
      Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan
  seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing
  curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.
      The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all
  farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has
  pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching
  a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.
      However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the
  Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is
  unrealistic.
      Asked about such criticism, Lyng said ""The alternative to
  doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I
  think that is the unrealistic position.""
      ""I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are
  trying to say.""
      Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a
  freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations 
  started.
      ""All that some countries would like to have would be a
  wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat.
  That doesn't do a thing for us,"" Lyng said.
      The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of
  agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he
  said.
      At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is
  expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC.

  The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering
  slightly from last year's decline in world oil prices,
  announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a
  deficit of 5.472 billion riyals.
      The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals
  in the last published budget for 1985/86.
      In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year
  1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh
  Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to
  spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.
      Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6
  billion riyals.
      Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about
  6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86
  projected revenue of 9.7 billion.
      The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to
  uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.
      Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government
  decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to
  one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15
  pct.
      He urged heads of government departments and public
  institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He
  did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.
      Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in
  1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on
  the country's foreign reserves.
      He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been
  allocated for major projects including housing and public
  buildings, social services, health, education, transport and
  communications, electricity and water, industry and
  agriculture.
      No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and
  security. There was also no projection for oil revenue.
      Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000
  barrels per day.
      Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: ""Our expectations of positive signs
  regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's
  determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its
  wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming
  year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota.""

  President Reagan said the United
  States must do more to lessen its reliance on imported oil.
      President Reagan said during a nationally televised news
  conference that the rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil is a
  problem that the administration is studying.
      ""We have to study this more,"" Reagan said. ""This is why we
  increased the Strategic (Petroleum) Reserve, but we have to do
  more,"" he said.
      Reagan said his administration has already proposed
  deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits
  tax on crude oil production.
      However, he complained that Congress had not yet approved
  those measures.
      The Department of Energy earlier this week released a
  report that warned of rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil
  imports at a time when domestic production is declining. It
  suggested options for the administration to consider, but made
  no specific recommendations.

  The United States has offered Navy
  warships to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers into and out of the 
  Gulf where they could be threatened by new Iranian anti-ship
  missiles, U.S. defense officials said today.
      ""We believe the Kuwaitis have also approached the Soviet
  Union about the possibility of using Soviet tankers"" to ship
  their oil, one of the officials told Reuters. ""But if there is
  superpower protection, we would rather it come from us,"" the
  official said.
      The officials, who asked not to be identified, said Kuwait
  had asked about possible protection for a dozen vessels, most
  of them oil tankers, which could be supplied by three U.S. Navy
  guided missile destroyers and two guided missile frigates now
  in the southern part of the Gulf.
      ""We told them we would give them help and we are waiting to
  hear the Kuwaiti response to our offer,"" one official said.
      In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy's small
  Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has
  moved 18 warships -- including the Aircraft Carrier Kitty Hawk
  -- into the northern Indian Ocean in the past month.
      White House and defense officials said today that massing
  of the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the
  Iran-Iraq war or Iran's recent stationing of Chinese-made 
  anti-ship missiles near the mouth of the Gulf.
      The land-based missiles have increased concern in Kuwait
  and other Middle East countries that their oil shipments might
  be affected. Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in
  the  Gulf by Iran and Iraq since early 1984. White House
  spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters today that it was in
  the U.S. strategic interest to keep the free flow of oil in the
  gulf and through the Straits of Hormuz.
      But he said U.S. ships in the region were on routine
  maneuvers.
      Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on Sunday declined to
  discuss specifics, but said the United States would do whatever
  was necessary to keep the Gulf shipping open in the face of new
  Iranian anti-ship missiles in the region.
      ""We are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the
  shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in
  that very vital waterway of the world,"" he said on NBC
  television's ""Meet the Press.""
      The State Department said Friday Iran has been informed
  about U.S. concern over the threat to oil shipments in the
  Gulf. The communciation was sent through Switzerland, which
  represents American interests in Iran.
       Iran on Sunday denied as baseless reports that it intended
  to threaten shipping in the gulf and warned the United States
  that any interference in the region would meet a strong
  response from Tehran, Tehran Radio said.
      An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted in a
  broadcast monitored by the BBC in London, said reports that
  Iran intends to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless.
      ""In conjunction with this misleading propaganda, America has
  already paved the ground to achieve its expansionist and
  hegemonistic intentions, aiming to build up its military
  presence in the region,"" he was quoted as saying.

  Indonesia told the oil industry on
  Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and
  improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased
  expenditure on exploration in return.
      President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian
  Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend
  contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.
      ""In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the
  government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending
  production sharing contracts under the present laws,"" Suharto
  said.
      ""Apart from that, the government will keep improving the
  investment climate in order to accelerate the development of
  the petroleum industry,"" he said.
      Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he
  was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that
  contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be
  renewed before they would invest in further exploration.
      ""As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully
  aware of this situation,"" Subroto said.
      ""The government has already made the political decision to
  entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers
  to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a
  selective basis.""
      Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil
  reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil
  industry sources say.
      Subroto said the government was also working to ease other
  problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or
  deep water conditions.
      But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way
  and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now
  that the oil price had recovered.
      President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of
  technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil
  industry for the regions in which companies operated.
      Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company
  Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production
  expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to
  fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in
  1986.
      Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation
  contracts with foreign oil companies.
      Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field
  operations was a government priority. There had been
  misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry
  in certain areas, such as when a field is designated
  commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.
      He said the government wanted to finalise contract
  extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the
  meantime to maintain its exploration drive.
      Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain
  exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire
  within 10 years. ""This need in itself is some sort of guarantee
  that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement.""
      Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal
  between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.
      Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved
  detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.
      Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions
  would be selective, based on how much capital would be
  invested.

  The American Soybean Association (ASA)
  denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal
  under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and
  threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not
  remedy the situation.
      ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored
  Outlook 87 conference: ""It will be filed unless the EC takes
  drastic and immediate steps.""
      ""These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,
  since they were established after the zero soybean duty was
  established in 1962,"" he said.
      The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask
  for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to
  make the regime non-discriminatory.
      The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in
  an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production
  has risen dramatically since then.
      The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world
  market levels and is considering implementing a controversial
  oils and fats tax.
      The subsidies ""are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero
  duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,"" Adams
  said.
      The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its
  trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an
  EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the
  EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.
      U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in
  volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of
  EC policies, Adams added.
      Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at
  the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973
  when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.

  Canada has threatened to stop imports

  agriculture ministry official told Reuters.
      The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at the
  request of the European Commission, which Denmark approached
  for support.
      Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an
  interview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: ""Denmark will not

      Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns
  in 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Community
  totalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.
      Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion
  that the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC
  veterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.
      But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen said
  the inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on EC
  regulations. ""Canadian officials are very concerned about the
  trade implications. We are holding active discussions with the

  The European Commission's decision to
  release an additional 300,000 tonnes of British intervention
  feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate
  relief in an increasingly tight market, traders said.
      Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage,
  pointing out that at this week's U.K. Intervention tender the
  market sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonnes
  were granted.
      The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to
  satisfy demand, they said, and keen buying competition for
  supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm.
      The release of the feed wheat followed recent strong
  representations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission.
  There has been growing concern that rising internal prices,
  triggered by heavy exports, were creating areas of shortage in
  interior markets.
      The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at the
  April 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month.
  The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May and
  June.
      News of the release produced an early downward reaction in
  local physical markets, but by midday some sections had halved
  early two stg losses while others were unchanged.
      Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mln
  tonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in the
  free market. However, some traders believe these figures are
  overstated and, while some may still be held on the farm, the
  bulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also off
  the market in futures stores.
      A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been
  sold for export or to the home market since the season started
  July 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59
  mln tonnes.
      Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mln
  tonnes, leaving about 753,000 tonnes, traders said.
      This season's U.K. Export performance has surpassed all
  early expectations and has created the present nervous
  situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market
  supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in
  August.
      The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total
  barley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes, a new
  record and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnes
  achieved in the 1984/85 season.
      Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln and
  barley around 4.50 mln tonnes.
      The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mln
  tonnes of British wheat and barley this season, but only 1.28
  mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25, traders
  said.
      Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British
  grain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mln
  tonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley. This compares
  with 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season.
      The market is expecting prices, particularly wheat, to stay
  buoyant for the remaining few months of the season. If supplies
  become more difficult and prices strengthen further, feed
  compounders may increase cereal substitute usage, traders said.

"training/1272";"International_Trade";"3";"CANADA ECONOMY EXPECTED TO GROW MODERATELY
  Canadian economic growth is expected to
  slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should
  keep the country from recession, economists said.
      ""The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth
  over the course of 1987,"" said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at
  Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd.
      Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product,
  grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion,
  but down from 1985's four pct.
      In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized
  rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the
  third quarter.
      ""Essentially it is a flat performance,"" said Warren Jestin,
  deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.
      Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson
  Bongard Inc said ""it shows the economy is not moving along very
  steadily, it's not a very promising number.""
      ""We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter
  in Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession,"" she
  added.
      The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by
  Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last
  month. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this
  year.
      Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will
  likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range.
      Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade
  performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in
  the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs
  from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.
      ""The sharp increase in the deficit originated from
  merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to
  advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged,"" the
  federal agency said in a statement.
      The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion
  dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.
      But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S.
  economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and
  help fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of
  Canada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year.

  China's trade deficit in the first
  quarter fell to 1.05 billion dlrs from 3.04 billion in the same
  1986 period, customs figures show.
      Zhang Zhongji, spokesman of the State Statistical Bureau,
  quoted the figures as showing exports rose 27 pct to 7.28
  billion dlrs and imports fell 5.1 pct to 8.33 billion.
      He said if imports of gifts, foreign aid items and
  materials for joint ventures are excluded, the deficit was only
  350 mln dlrs, and the surplus on invisibles was 700 mln. As a
  result, foreign exchange reserves increased somewhat from their
  level at end-1986, he said, but gave no figure.
      Official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrs
  at end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985.
      Zhang said one reason for the rise in exports was improved
  incentives to export firms, which are being allowed to retain
  more foreign exchange from the goods they sell.
      He said first quarter exports to Hong Kong and Macao rose
  35.5 pct to 2.48 billion dlrs and imports rose 55.3 pct to 1.46
  billion. Exports to Japan fell 2.3 pct to 1.28 billion and
  imports 24.4 pct to 2.14 billion.
      Exports to the U.S. Rose 23 pct to 640 mln dlrs and imports
  fell 26.7 pct to 840 mln. Exports to the EEC rose 35.1 pct to
  770 mln dlrs and imports fell 3.8 pct to 1.5 billion, he said.

  Mobil Corp increased net proven
  reserves of natural gas liquids in 1986 from the previous year
  according to data in its 1986 annual report.
      The report states that total net proved reserves at year's
  end stood at 2.5 billion barrels, an increase of 94 mln barrels
  or four pct above the previous year and detailed data show that
  the gains resulted from an increase in net proved reserves of
  natural gas liquids.
      Mobil said gains were in Indonesia where a sixth production
  facility began operation in October with a capacity to
  manufacture 1.7 mln tonnes of liquified natural gas.
      The company also said that new capacity brought onstream
  last year replaced 120 pct of Mobil's production, which
  declined by about four pct in 1986 from the previous year.
      Detailed data on reserves shows that U.S. net proved
  reserves of crude oil fell to 837 mln barrels from 853 mln
  barrels in 1985, natural gas liquid reserves were also lower in
  1986 from the previous year.

  Texaco Inc &lt;TX> said its decision to
  file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
  code will not affect the majority of its businesses.
      It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its
  32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property,
  plant and equipment, were free of the action.
      Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operating
  subsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, are
  affected, it said.
      But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents
  per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments
  on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.
      Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were
  demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a
  result of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.
      Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond
  of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985
  judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's
  1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp &lt;GTY>. The bond almost
  matches the damages awarded against Texaco.
      Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could begin
  to attach its assets to secure the judgment.
      Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut
  Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to
  the Texas courts.
      Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all
  Texaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of
  the Pennzoil lawsuit.
      ""Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond
  issue and the larger dispute failed,"" James Kinnear, Texaco's
  president and chief executive officer, told reporters.
      Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers on
  Friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until
  the end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.
      Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash
  bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of
  earnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not
  sell any assets, Kinnear said.
      Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of
  credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under
  11.1 billion dlrs, he added.
      Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the
  company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on
  Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for
  bankruptcy.
      He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a
  confidentiality agreement between the two companies. ""Texaco
  told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go
  to bankruptcy court,"" Jamail said.
      Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would
  prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were
  ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.

  The U.S. meat and poultry inspection
  programs are incapable of protecting consumers from
  contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and
  consumers charged.
      ""The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has
  been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the
  public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated
  meat,"" Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation of
  Government Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee.
      ""The American consumer has little reason to feel confident
  about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him
  today,"" said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community
  Nutrition Institute.
      ""Company management is less concerned about the risk to
  health than about raising plant output and company profits,""
  Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on
  Livestock, Dairy and Poultry.
      Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government
  Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose
  violations of federal law, demonstrating a ""serious breakdown in
  the entire inspection system.""
      Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being
  contaminated by ""intestines dragging in a water trough used to
  flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit,
  chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow
  their noses.""
      Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture
  Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended
  the government's program, calling it ""one of the most respected
  public health programs in the world.""
      FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5
  billion chicken and turkeys every year.
      Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with
  change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in
  the meat and poultry supply has increased.
      He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium
  salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time
  and much money to contain the growing problem.
      Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is
  found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw
  pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.
      The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20
  years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.
      ""We certainly really have not found an effective means of
  turning this disease around,"" said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)
      The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS
  intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for
  detecting microoganisms.
      But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls
  would cost too much.
      ""Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily
  complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real
  goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and
  economical meat supply for consumers,"" Stanley Emerling,
  executive vice president of the National Association of Meat
  Purveyors, said.
      Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new
  program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at
  certain plants ""voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be
  repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic
  of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor
  legal recourse.""
      Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the
  panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2.

  Venezuela's cabinet approved a new
  exchange rate for oil and mining export earnings, setting it at
  14.50 bolivars to the dollar from 7.50 bolivars previously,
  Minister Manuel Azpur UA said.
      Azpur told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the
  measure is ""fundamental to conserving the economic and financial
  strength of the petroleum industry.""
       He said the new exchange rate, which goes before the
  central bank for final approval tommorrow, will allow the state
  oil company Petroleos De Venezuela, S.A.(PDVSA) to solve its
  problem of working capital and implement investment plans,
  estimated at 20 billion bolivars for 1987. He did not say when
  the measure would become effective.
     Venezuela's oil industry previously sold its dollar earnings
  to the government at 7.50 to the dollar but bought foreign
  exchange from its imports at 14.50 bolivars.
     The new exchange rate will promote purchases of domestic
  goods and services by the industry, Azpur said. He added that
  it would also put PDVSA in a position to purchase more
  government debt bonds.                        
      PDVSA had available liquid assets of 20 billion bolivars at
  the start of this year, of which nine billion were in a trust
  fund in the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) and placed in
  government bonds.
    According to a contract between PDVSA and the central bank,
  the BCV must provide cash as the oil industry requries by
  repurchasing the bonds.
      PDVSA's contribution to the treasury last year was 44.480
  billion bolivars. It foreign earnings for oil and petrochemcial
  sales were 8.023 billion dlrs.

      Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have

  rice along with the state corporations.
      He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to make

  The outlook for the West
  German economy is relatively bright, with gross national
  product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel
  University's Institute for World Economy said.
      The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading
  economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic
  than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently
  reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.
      In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export
  outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's
  strength against the dollar and other major currencies.
      ""The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in
  all, limited,"" the report said. ""On the contrary, a slight rise
  in exports can be expected.""
      The institute said past experience has shown West German
  exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by
  cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting
  their product ranges.
      They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in
  economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the
  decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow
  this year.
      West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed
  advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both
  of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary
  policy, the institute said.
      However, it said the labour market would see only a slight
  improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire
  additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by
  agreed reductions in working hours.
      The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of
  monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked
  acceleration of inflation.
      It also warned that what it called the worldwide
  synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new
  global recession. It said central banks in industrialized
  countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal
  Reserve Board's expansionary course.
      The institute said this in turn was bound to lead
  eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.
  Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks
  were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could
  aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as
  increase protectionism around the world.
      Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the
  negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary
  policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of
  growth at home.
      The institute said this could be done by ensuring that
  fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes
  should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and
  wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than
  in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary
  pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply
  to about four pct.

  West Germany takes ""very seriously"" the
  recent undertaking by major industrial countries to promote
  exchange rate stability around current levels, Finance Ministry
  State Secretary Hans Tietmeyer said.
      Talking to journalists before a meeting of European
  Community Economy and Finance Ministers here, Tietmeyer
  declined to say whether the February 22 Paris accord by the
  Group of Five countries plus Canada included secret agreements
  for stabilising currencies.
      But he noted the official communique said the participants
  agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange
  rates around current levels. ""We're taking this sentence very
  seriously,"" he said.
      Tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved against
  the mark since the meeting.
      He said a slowdown in West German economic growth had been
  caused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the Paris
  agreement should help in this respect.
      Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said the
  Bonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster the
  economy but was paying close attention to the slower growth and
  had not ruled out ""appropriate and timely"" action if necessary.
      Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussion
  by the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on the
  economic situation in the 12-nation bloc.
      The Commission has sharply revised down expected German
  gross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pct
  predicted last autumn and says Bonn has the most room of any EC
  country to stimulate economic activity.
      Schlecht said the upturn in West Germany's economy slowed
  in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of
  1987. But he said there was no cumulative downwards trend in
  view that would make quick remedial action necessary.
      He said a number of favourable indicators such as high
  level of investment and a good climate for consumption meant a
  recovery could be expected, while exports would pick up
  slightly during the course of the year.

  The U.S. Agriculture Department
  increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet
  Union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.
      In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the
  USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because
  Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last
  month.
      USDA said the increased purchasing is ""somewhat surprising""
  because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.
      All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,
  USDA said.
      Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12
  mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes
  miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.
      USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered
  through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.
      The severe winter ""is believed to have resulted in above
  average winter-kill,"" USDA said.
      Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses
  maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying
  grain recently.
      USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes
  grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat
  and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.

  The current crude oil price of between

  keep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said.
      Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade
  officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint
  by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government
  officials said.
      They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made
  the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third
  World debt and industrialised nations.
      Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher
  energy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said.
      Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the
  beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial
  countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead
  to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he
  said.
      This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high

      Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower
  earnings from many key commodities including rice whose
  earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26
  pct and canned pineapples seven pct.
      Products registering high export growth were jewellery up

  U.S. warships destroyed an Iranian oil

      President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
  warned Iran of even stronger countermeasures if the military

  Japan's trade surplus is likely to
  continue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroad
  increase while domestic demand remains sluggish, the
  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
  said.
      In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the
  OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last
  year, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while
  export markets rose by only two pct.
      But it said this differential between the growth of
  domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,
  ""thus weakening the international adjustment process.""
      It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two
  pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct
  in 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will
  rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in
  1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.
      The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion
  yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand
  and increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said the
  measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite
  possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have
  worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.
      The OECD outlook said, ""Continued large current account
  surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial
  net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure
  on the yen."" It said that further appreciation could then lead
  manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus
  weaken domestic growth.
      The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely to
  gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pct
  growth. But it said Japan would continue its good performance
  on inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a
  0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.

  Consumer energy costs rose 1.9 pct

  Department said.
      The February increase in the overall energy costs,
  including petroleum, coal and natural gas, followed a 0.2 pct
  drop in December and a 3.0 pct rise in January, it said.
      Energy prices were 12.2 pct below year-ago levels.
      The department's Consumer Price Index showed that the cost
  of gasoline rose in February by 4.2 pct, after a 6.6 pct rise
  in January.
      Gasoline prices were nonetheless 18.0 pct below their
  levels as of February 1986.
      Also, the category including fuel oil, coal and bottled gas
  rose in February by 3.8 pct, putting it 14.9 pct under the

  Norway's state oil company
  Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) &lt;STAT.OL>, has told
  Thai authorities it is interested in taking a 30 pct share in a
  big offshore Thailand gas field, Statoil said.
      The field, in the southern sector of the Gulf of Thailand,
  is currently operated by U.S. Oil company Texas Pacific Oil Co
  Inc, a unit of Canada's Seagram Co Ltd &lt;VO.N>. Thailand's state
  oil company &lt;Petroleum Authority Thailand> (PTT) also holds a
  major stake in the field.
      PTT wants to develop the field and has asked Statoil to
  consider co-development if the field's licence is renewed.
      PTT, according to Statoil, is currently negotiating with
  Texas Pacific to buy back the Dallas-based oil company's
  holdings in the field.
      ""PTT must first sort out its problems with Texas Pacific.
  When this is done, we have said we are interested in taking
  over a 30 pct share in the field,"" Statoil spokesman Willy Olsen
  told Reuters.
      Statoil, hired by PTT to carry out an independent appraisal
  of the field's reserves and propose a development plan, has
  estimated the field could be commercially developed at a cost
  of some 700 mln crowns.
      Industry sources said Texas Pacific has submitted lower
  reserve estimates for the field than Statoil and shown little
  interest in its development. Statoil refused to disclose its
  upgraded reserve estimate for the field.
      The field's reserves could be sold domestically through
  Thailand's gas distribution network or by converting the gas to
  electricity, the sources said.
      Sources would not say which field Statoil is considering.

  Union Pacific Corp said it will sign a
  pact in Caracas on March 17 with Petroleos De Venezuela, PDVSA,
  to sell the state owned company half of its Corpus Christi,
  Texas refinery owned by its Union Pacific's Champlin Petroleum
  Co subsidiary.
      The sale will also include the related marketing and
  distribution system for the refinery's products.
      A spokesman for the company said that a statement may be
  issued later today giving details of the transaction.
      There was no immediate comment from PDVSA officials in New
  York.
      The Corpus Christi refinery has a capacity of about 160,000
  barrels per day, the Union Pacific spokesman said, and is a
  largely upgraded facility but he would place no value on the
  transaction.
      The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution
  assets by PDVSA has been expected as Venezuela has been moving
  aggressively to enhance its role in the oil industry from
  producer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector.
      Purchase of part of Champlin's operations also fits a
  profile which PDVSA officials have said previously they looked
  for in any acquisition.
      One PDVSA official said the company was looking for
  independent oil companies with good refinery and distribution
  network and a strong regional presence.
      The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followed
  its earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corp's
  &lt;SLC> Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary.
      In that agreement signed September 15, 1986, PDVSA paid
  Southland 290 mln dlrs for half of Citgo's stock.
      The potetnital acquisition of half Champlin's Corpus
  Christi plant will also give Venezuela an additional outlet for
  its crude oil production while giving the refiner an assured
  source of supply, trade sources said.
      In the earlier deal with Southland, PDVSA agredd to to
  supply Citgo with at least 130,000 bpd of crude oil and other
  feedstocks.

  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
  has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help
  Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist
  pressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.
      Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's Economic
  Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister
  Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help
  Japan as well as the United States.
      The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by
  Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.
      However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was
  already the world's largest grain importer.
      Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and
  depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food
  requirements in 1985.
      Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm
  products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on
  beef, citrus products and rice.
      Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of
  self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice
  because potential production is higher than domestic demand.
      The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of
  rising production by exporting countries, he added.
      Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product
  output with expensive programs, Maki said.
      Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussions

  Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and
  Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force
  to be reckoned with, political analysts said.
      MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.
  And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of
  a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,
  they said.
      ""The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of
  a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,""
  said one diplomatic source.
      ""They are a potent political force,"" the diplomatic source
  said.
      But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not
  always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts
  said.
      ""The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not
  so internationalized,"" said Waseda University professor Mitsuru
  Uchida. ""Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world
  community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to
  face the situation.""
      Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with
  London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep
  a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in
  Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business.
      The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival
  groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one
  competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now
  monopolizes the business.
      It has also opposed a major management role in the planned
  merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on
  the grounds that no such international precedent exists.
      The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has
  threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger
  plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open
  its telecommunications market.
      Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it
  says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car
  telephone and satellite communications market.
      Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the
  sector it regulates.
      ""What has been happening is an important shift in the
  economy which makes the ministry a very important place,"" said
  James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory
  Service Inc.
      A decision to open the telecommunications industry to
  competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted
  rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.
      ""With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto
  legal framework,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell
  Whitten.
      Close links with the powerful political faction of the
  ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime
  Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the
  analysts said.
      ""Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka
  faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance
  of MPT,"" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of
  the influential political group, he added.
      The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to
  the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the
  Postal Savings System, analysts said.
      MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate
  interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial
  liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal
  Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than
  banks, they said.
      Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's
  obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized
  the ministry as feudal.
      Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting
  competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its
  wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest
  price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.
      But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of
  its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world
  including Britain, several analysts said.
      ""The United States is really the odd man out,"" Abegglen said.
  ""For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order
  in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable
  view,"" he said.

  begin buying or selling cocoa.
      Since prices are below the ""may-buy"" level of 1,655 Special

      Delegates and traders said they expected the manager,
  Juergen Plambeck, to intervene in the market within three weeks
  of the pact coming into force.
      The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins or
  the second hand market on an offer system, not by means of a
  posted price as in the previous cocoa accord.
      The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set of
  differentials, ranging from 137 stg for most expensive Ghana
  cocoa to zero for Malaysian cocoa.
      Purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will be
  limited to 15 pct of the total stock and those on any one day
  should be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate and
  forward positions.
      The council meeting, which is expected to conclude two

      One official, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters a
  draft agreement would reduce to zero from two pct future
  interest payable on the 10 year-old debt, and set a 25 year
  repayment term.
      Talks are due to begin in Moscow on Wednesday.
      Economy Minister Youssri Mustapha, who leaves for Moscow on
  Tuesday, met President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ambassador to

      One official said Egypt would propose a new exchange rate
  for trade with the Soviet Union. Current commerce is based on a
  rate set in the 1960s of 0.38 Egyptian pounds to the dollar
  which Moscow sees as unreasonable. The fluctuating official
  rate is about 1.36 pounds to the dollar.
      The officials said part of the debt would be paid in

  dlrs were included in the February trade deficit of 15.1
  billion dlrs reported on Tuesday.
      The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after
  the initial trade report to issue a second report on a ""customs
  value"" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance
  charges from the cost of imports.
      Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce
  Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion
  dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis.
      A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the
  foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers
  said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been
  revised downward.
      The Commerce department would like to have the law changed
  to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously.
      ""My feeling is the second one is a better report but there's
  legislation that requires us to delay it two days,"" said Robert
  Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.
      ""But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays
  any attention to the second figure.""
      The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a
  revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs.
      The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly
  trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in
  1979.
      Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includes
  customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison
  with other countries that reported their trade balances on the
  same basis.
      The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting
  freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable
  light for the Reagan administration.
      Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to
  eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures.
      ""We're considering it,"" he said, ""It's one of those dinosaur
  laws and I think it's time has come.""

  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton

  to the Senate Finance Committee.
      ""In the long term we cannot repeatedly bludgeon other
  nations into opening their markets with threats of U.S.

      Yeutter did not mention the recent U.S. trade sanctions

      Yeutter said the trade bill should increase U.S.

  provoking foreign retaliation.
      He urged Congress to reject provisions that would mandate
  U.S. retaliation against foreign unfair trade practices.
      Yeutter emphasized the importance of the new multilateral

  Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a
  new high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs on March 4, compared
  with 50 billion in mid-February and 25.1 billion a year
  earlier, the central bank said.
      Bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the increase
  came mainly from the bank's purchases of more than one billion
  U.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and
  March 4.
      He said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, because
  Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade
  surplus to decline over the next few months as a result.
      Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise,
  but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion
  U.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987.
      In January, Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct
  on some 1,700 foreign products. It had been under growing U.S.
  Pressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surplus
  with the U.S. Taiwan's 1985 surplus with the U.S. Was 10.2
  billion, according to official statistics.
      Wang Chang-Ming, Vice Chairman of the Council for Economic
  Planning and Development, told Reuters the government is
  planning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half
  of this year.
      The reserves could support imports of more than two years
  for Taiwan, compared with about three months for Japan and the
  U.S.

  Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves, bouyed
  by rising exports, have hit a record high and are likely to
  soar to 72 billion U.S. Dlrs by the year end, central bank
  officials said Tuesday.
      Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the
  reserves totalled about 69 billion U.S. Dlrs, compared with
  about 42 billion at the same time last year and 68 billion on
  October 5. He declined to elaborate.
      A senior bank official, who declined to be named, told
  Reuters the reserves were likely to reach 72 billion dlrs at
  the end of the year.
      ""The surge in reserves is the result of our trade surplus
  and recent purchases of U.S. Dollars on the local interbank
  market,"" Chang said.
      Taiwan's trade surplus hit a record 14.95 billion U.S. Dlrs
  in the first nine months of 1987 compared with 11.05 billion a
  year earlier, official figures show.
      Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-hsien said the surplus
  will rise to about 20 billion dlrs by the end of the year.
  About 80 pct of the surplus will come from the island's trade
  with the United States.

  High wage settlements in Nordic countries
  threaten to cut exports and reduce the international

      In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded in
  early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration
  in competitiveness. Sweden's competitive position was also seen
  at risk from accelerating wages.
      The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come under
  pressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well as
  Norway, Sweden and Finland.
      Overall economic growth will vary in the different
  countries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual report
  said.
      After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domestic
  demand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one
  pct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see a
  slump in domestic demand. The report said growth in Gross

  Sweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmark
  and Norway.

  European coffee roasters and traders
  have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating
  International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee
  Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.
      Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee
  Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.
      The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and
  would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an
  unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current
  coffee agreement, van Horick said.
      If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the
  ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new
  agreement, van Horick said.
      Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when
  prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in
  Brazil.
      Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and
  producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.
      ""Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the
  formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal
  leaves it very little to object to,"" van Horick said.
      ""The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not
  reflect supply and demand reality,"" he said. ""Our formula
  builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost
  everyone.""
      Although full implications of the new formula have still to
  be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as
  Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly
  higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El
  Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.
      Because the proposal provides that future quota
  distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it
  should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing
  so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.
      ""If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least
  a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the
  September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a
  new quota formula, "" van Horick said.
      At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.
      ""Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If
  there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two
  months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might
  just get an agreement,"" van Horick added.

  The threatened trade war between the
  United States and Japan is just the kind of shock that
  economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin.
      But they are not so sure if that would be a brief
  corrective dip, or whether this week's falling share prices
  mark the start of a ""bear"" market.
      ""It's the billion dollar question,"" said Richard O'Brien,
  economist at American Express International Bank in London.
      Japan's trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- has
  poured into share and bond markets around the world, and funded
  a good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third of
  any new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the
  Japanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as the
  dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it
  fall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart of
  improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or
  because the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods,
  may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget
  deficit.
     And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will
  have less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the
  gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S.
  Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O'Brien said. The
  subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls
  on the world stock markets.
      ""A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,""
  said O'Brien. ""Now, it is much less certain.""
      Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming
  economy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best in
  the industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt and
  huge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O'Brien.
      Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of Smith
  Barney Harris Upham said  ""We're still in a bull market,"" adding
  that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and ""The
  bear usually strikes slowly.""
      Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co in
  London, said the huge sums of money going through the world
  financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices.
      Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in
  non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it's very
  difficult to see where else they can put their money than in
  U.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market,
  according to David Butcher, a senior executive at Yamaichi
  Securities Co Ltd's bond operation in London.
      He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention now
  to the French franc and West German mark.
      In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions and
  the dollar's slide will mean for securities markets.

  Storage problems with Brazil's record
  grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln
  tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.
      Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,
  told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this
  year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.
      He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in
  harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage
  problems.
      Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,
  theoretically sufficient for the crop.
      But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly
  distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do
  Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were
  responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.
      The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West
  growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage
  capacity.
      Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and
  maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains
  production but only 20 pct of its storage space.
      In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,
  there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to
  storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for
  storing loose grain, Brito said.
      Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the
  crops.
      The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop
  has been evident from television reports, which have shown
  enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.

  Portugal's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
  will grow around four pct this year, the same rate as in 1986,
  according to a Bank of Portugal forecast.
      Total investment this year, the country's second as a
  member of the European Community (EC), will rise nearly 10 pct,
  again the same rate as last year, the central bank study said.
      It added that Portugal's current account was forecast to
  show a surplus of 400 mln dlrs this year compared with 1.13
  billion in 1986 and 369 mln the previous year.
      Last year's high surplus was attributed to cheaper oil and
  raw materials, lower world interest rates and a weaker dollar.
      Imports by volume were forecast to grow 10 pct this year
  and exports four pct compared with increases of 16.5 pct and
  6.6 pct respectively in 1986, the bank said.
      The forecasts were calculated on the assumption that the
  non-expansionary monetary policy carried out by the current
  government would be maintained, particularly in budget spending
  and income and in wage policy.
      The bank added that the 1987 forecasts were also based on
  the assumption that the international economic situation and
  Portugal's world trade relations would remain more or less the
  same as in 1986.
      The central bank said the high rate of investment estimated
  for 1986 was due to government policies and to increasing
  optimism among firms whose financial situation had improved
  since 1985. This tendency was expected to continue this year,
  especially in the construction and public works sectors.
      Financial aid from the EC had also helped to boost
  investment last year, the bank said.

      ""I am more impressed with what's happening at IBM than I
  have been in a long time,"" said PaineWebber analyst Stephen

      ""But they're not out of the woods yet,"" he added.
      At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easily
  topped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from an
  even dollar to 1.20 dlrs.
      Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM's
  performance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a full

  felt until later in the year.
      These include the success of IBM's new personal computer
  line, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,
  which will begin volume shipments in July.
      In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of its
  early-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves will
  emerge as the year progresses.
      Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers was
  relatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook than
  he has been for nearly a year.
      ""Although the worldwide economic situation remains
  unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,""

      A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframe

  The U.S. House Agriculture Committee
  approved proposals to extend the life of the Export Enhancement
  Program, EEP, through fiscal 1990 and urged the Reagan
  administration offer EEP wheat to the Soviet Union.
      The proposals were approved as amendments to a
  comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year.
      In addition to the amendments on EEP, the committee
  approved several proposals which could restrict imports of
  lamb, casein, sugar-containing products and tobacco. Those
  amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because
  the House Ways and Means Committee, which has overall
  jurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them,
  Congressional sources said.
      The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the
  life of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than
  the current three years through fiscal 1988.
      The amendments, offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., also
  would increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from
  1.5 billion now.
      Furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered by
  Rep. Glickman which instructs the U.S. Agriculture Department
  to value EEP bonus commodities at market value, not acquisition
  value. Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct
  less expensive to operate.
      The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union, offered by
  Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., does not require the administration
  make an offer, but urges such action.
      The committee approved an amendment, offered by Rep. Glenn
  English, D-Okla., requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to
  begin discussions with other major grain producing countries
  aimed at jointly reducing world grain production.
      Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed the
  amendment, saying such commodity agreements do not work.
      Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approved
  by the panel, the most significant would require quotas on
  imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm
  product that is subject to U.S. quotas. The amendment, offered
  by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is aimed primarily at
  curbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and
  foreign foods containing dairy products. It also may affect
  peanut, cotton and tobacco imports, Committee sources said.
      Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports of
  casein, a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by New
  Zealand and Ireland.
      The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same
  countercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S.
  beef imports.
      Other miscellaneous amendments included:
      -- Urging the administration consider retaliating against
  Japan and South Korea if those countries do not remove
  restrictions on beef imports.
      -- Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shipped
  each year under a food aid program called Section 416 to
  800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now.
      -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study of
  the Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat to
  determine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier.
      -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse the
  National Corn Growers Association up to 500,000 dlrs for the
  costs of defending the U.S. feedgrains program against a
  Canadian countervailing duty case this year.
      -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decision
  to apply a duty on U.S. corn imports, and a proposal by the
  European Community to apply a vegetable oils tax.
      -- USDA conduct a study of the findings of a National
  Commission on Agricultural Export Policy, which recommended a
  reorganization of USDA's trade policy apparatus.

  A cold air mass working its way
  south from Canada may pose a threat to developing hard red
  winter wheat in Oklahoma, according to Eugene Krenzler, wheat
  specialist for the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension.
      ""There is some threat. Some of the crop is far enough along
  so that it's probably vulnerable,"" Krenzler said.
      Accu Weather meteorologist Dale Mohler said cold air moving
  from the north could put temperatures in the middle 20's
  fahrenheit as early as tonight, depending on development of a
  low pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall the
  system.
      If impeded by the low-pressure area, the cold air could hit
  Oklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning. Temperatures
  could stay in the mid-20's for up to eight hours, Mohler said.
      Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crop
  has advanced to boot stage. The closer to that stage the more
  vulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather, he said.
      ""We can handle probably an hour or so down to 25 or 26
  degrees (fahrenheit),"" Krenzler said, ""as long as we don't have
  a lot of wind.""
      ""If we do get six hours down below 25 degrees I'd say we
  have a good chance of significant damage to the heads,"" he
  said.
      Krenzler said early planted stands in the north-central and
  southwestern parts of the state are probably most vulnerable.
  Crops in the panhandle of Oklahoma and Texas are less developed
  and have some snow cover protection from the cold, he noted.

  Britain's gold and currency reserves rose
  a record underlying 4.76 billion dlrs in May, following April's

      The underlying trend indicates the level of recent Bank of
  England intervention on currency markets to curb sterling's
  strength. It was above market expectations which had been for a
  rise of between one billion and three billion dlrs.
      The Treasury declined comment on the figures.
      Actual reserves rose 4.87 billion dlrs in May, compared
  with April's 2.8 billion increase, to a total value of 34.68
  billion dlrs, compared with 29.81 billion at the end of April.

  85 mln dlrs, after 90 mln previously, with capital repayments
  of eight mln, after three mln last month.
      Repayments of government debt amounted to 33 mln dlrs.

  Cominco Ltd said it
  expects to meet today with two of five United Steelworkers of

      It had no meeting scheduled with the other three striking
  locals, which rejected a tentative three-year contract
  Saturday, Cominco spokesman Richard Fish said.
      Fish said the pact that was rejected contained a cost of
  living increase tied to the Canadian consumer price index, but
  no wage increase. With 81 pct of the membership voting, 54.5
  pct voted no and 45.5 pct voted yes, the union said.
      The three locals represent about 2,600 production and
  maintenance workers, while the remaining two locals cover about
  600 office and technical workers.
      The office and technical workers last negotiated May 21.
  Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since the
  strike began May 9 and Cominco has had to declare force
  majeure, which means the company may be unable to honor
  contracts for products from the smelter and mine.
      Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of
  which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.
      The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,

  lead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 miles

      The smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium.

  Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen to
  its lowest level in more than a year, giving fresh evidence of
  the kingdom's determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a
  barrel, as agreed by Opec last December, oil industry sources
  said.
      They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March
  averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from the
  neutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February average
  of 3.5 mln bpd.
      They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude
  oil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must be
  counted towards a member's production quota. Saudi Arabia's
  quota is 4.133 mln bpd.
      The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, the
  world""s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opec
  official prices, even at the cost of lower production, the
  sources said.
      King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview with
  Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudi
  commitment to OPEC's December pact to boost oil prices to an
  average 18 dlrs.
      ""Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions,"" he
  said.
      The sources said the kingdom's exports from Gulf ports
  averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday,
  down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd.
      They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate
  with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain
  artificially high levels by putting oil into storage.
      The kingdom's main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms with
  past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon,
  Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the
  timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay
  official prices, the sources said.
      Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but
  still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed
  liftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said.
      They expected low early March output to pick up towards the

  tax credits allowable under the new tax law. The loss of the
  other half of the credits was reflected in the fourth quarter.
      In a discussion of steel results, USX said plants that were

  permanently closed. USX took a fourth quarter charge of 1.03
  billion dlrs to restructure its steel operations. The charge
  included the ""indefinite idling"" last month of four plants in
  Utah, Pennsylvania and Texas.
      Other plants or parts of plants in Pennsylvania, Indiana,
  Alabama, Ohio and Chicago had been previously idled.
      ""These operations are not permanently shut down. Improved
  market conditions for the products from these plants may make
  it feasible to reopen some of them,"" USX said in the report.
      ""On the other hand, a lack of any future market improvement
  may necessitate their permanent closing,"" it added.

  Taiwan will relax import controls on

      The move was to allow greater access to Taiwan markets by

  Cold and wet weather in northern,
  western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet
  growth but plant density is reported to be good in most
  countries, sugar statistician F.O. Licht said.
      Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has
  hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged
  fields.
      But in eastern and southeastern Europe, warmer weather has
  boosted sugar beet growth.
      Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet
  development, Licht said.
      In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plant
  population is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainy
  weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are
  rated as slightly below normal.
      In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool with
  heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.
      In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, it
  was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which
  continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work
  impossible.
      In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was
  favourable for beet growth, Licht said.
      In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouring
  beet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.
      In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union,
  it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was
  generally good for the emergence and growth of beets.
      In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfall
  boosted beet development.
      Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputes
  between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to
  delay the start of processing in the southern areas, where
  beets are maturing very early this year.

  World governments
  should prepare for an inevitable significant increase in the

      Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk
  of world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in a
  speech prepared for delivery to the Australian Petroleum
  Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference.
      It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere
  will not change this fact, he said.

  about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered.
      Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside the
  Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the
  last 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said.
      He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming
  20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the
  rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year.
      More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the

  outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a
  diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic
  stability.
      ""It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country
  discoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable

  Senior Japanese officials tomorrow
  open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch
  effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide
  variety of Japanese electronic exports.
      Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of
  meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael
  Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.
      The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in
  retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to
  end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and
  to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.
      They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors,
  including television and audio equipment and computers.
      Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little
  likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct
  duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.
      President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27
  after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986
  U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that
  Japan was not honoring the agreement.
      In making the annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed to
  the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to
  provide American industry with free and fair trade.""
      Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's
  semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured
  the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has
  complained about presidential timidity on trade issues.
      Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive
  trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's
  inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last
  year reached 169.8 billion dlrs.

  Flooding in the Red River on the
  Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a
  24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per
  day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a
  Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.
      ""The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any
  divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility
  that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week,"" a company
  source said.
      The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and
  one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.
      Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is
  restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring
  oil which has been lost to the flood.
      ""But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be
  difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like
  to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to.""
      The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield
  Corp &lt;ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell
  Group &lt;RD> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, which is the pipeline's
  operator.
       Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude
  oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to
  new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.
      July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to
  19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.
      Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of
  WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.
      Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline
  shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West
  Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a
  barrel below WTI, respectively.
      Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
  Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days
  but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River
  recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is
  dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area
  affecting the pipeline, Stevens said.
      He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was
  underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.
  The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil
  nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was
  apparently washed away.
     
      The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed
  at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this
  line.
      Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not
  found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma,
  which is nearby.

  Growth in oil consumption in the Western
  industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct
  this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International
  Energy Agency (IEA) said.
      Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around
  one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in
  its Monthly Oil Market Report.
      Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from
  transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are
  higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be
  below last year's 3.6 pct, it said.
      The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices
  stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can
  be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some
  of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there
  may be slightly less growth in transport fuels.
      IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at
  428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption.
  This is about the same level as at the begining of the year.
      The agency said this flat trend is explained by the
  projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of
  the year which offset a reduction in stocks.
      It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell
  by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the
  year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but
  a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.
      It is possible that final data will show a larger draw,
  particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell,
  there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported
  stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.
      Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
  on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built
  up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the
  period.
      The year-on-year trend of government stock building is
  continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more
  or less in line with consumption, after declining for five
  years, the IEA noted.
      Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6
  mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January
  1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption,
  respectively.
      Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April
  1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to
  94 days of consumption.
      World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln
  bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.
      This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
  production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5
  mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from
  centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.
      Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first
  quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd
  of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average
  for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled
  28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.
      A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast
  3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the
  largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA
  said.
      Saudi Arabia""s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd.

  Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax
  reform will not affect his determination to reign in
  expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline
  in the budget deficit in the late 1980s.
      ""Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,""
  Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.
      Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs
  in the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he
  forecast in the February budget.
      And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was
  expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32
  billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.
      Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year
  higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income
  support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated
  revenues.
      But finance department documents show the pace of deficit
  reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and
  1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the
  transition to the reformed taxation system.
      The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in
  fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1
  billion dlrs in 1991.
      Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian
  economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct
  this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an
  actual 3.1 pct.
      Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at around

      ""A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worried

      Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers for

      Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light,
  with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willing

      Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the belief
  that even if futures rally back to last month's highs, country
  movement may remain light because farmers in many areas are
  sold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern half
  of the Midwest.
      Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtime
  for maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducing
  the weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping the

  Momentum in th U.S. economy may be

      U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February,
  twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a
  319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously
  reported 448,000 increase.
      ""Even if you look at January and February together, this is
  still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in

  larger gains in February U.S. production and income than
  previously forecast.
      The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from
  34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose
  0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since
  November 1966, the Commerce Department said.
      ""The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very

  in February from 8.83 dlrs in January.
      ""Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means
  we'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis
  the wage and salary disbursement,"" he said.
      Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should
  rise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.
      He said the February employment gains are consistent with
  his firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national product
  growth forecast of 3.7 pct.
      Economists agreed that the employment data were negative
  for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy
  and no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. But
  most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.
      ""This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider
  easing,"" said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.  
    ""It gives them more room to address the dollar situation,"" he
  said. ""If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so,
  but it's most likely they'll sit and wait.""
      ""The data have not been uniform,"" Stone added. ""Durable
  goods were weak in January and now employment is strong.""
      In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct,
  followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S.
  retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap
  widened to 14.8 billion dlrs.
      ""Things just aren't adding up,"" said Steve Slifer of Lehman
  Goverment Securities Inc. ""Consumer spending, capital spending,
  goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first
  quarter GNP growth of one pct,"" he said.
      ""The employment and production data point to a big
  inventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourth
  quarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth.""
      Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000
  in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was
  accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery
  industries returning to work.
      Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains
  have resulted from an improving trade outlook.
      Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S.
  trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports
  grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in
  imports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve
  in the first quarter.
      ""Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter,
  but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper
  products, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show
  that trade is improving,"" Benderley said.
      ""The economy is moving between extremes,"" he said. ""Some
  reports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter
  GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct.""
      A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater
  part of February's employment gain. Retail services employment
  rose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in
  January, previously reported at 166,000.
      Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But
  this follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down
  from a previously reported 142,000 gain.
      The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in
  February at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at
  6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since
  March 1980, the Commerce Department noted.
      ""The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,""
  Carson said. ""This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease,
  but there's no reason to tighten. It's way too early for that.""

  British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay
  7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has
  signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said.
      ""I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and
  clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they
  think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,""
  said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
      BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70
  dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already
  own.
      ""It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the
  war and oil prices are not going to crack,"" said Prescott, Ball
  and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier.
      ""Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the
  energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those
  that are acquisition targets,"" Lazier said.
      One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an
  energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl
  Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a
  Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock.
      Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms
  falling into takeover situations for several years, with the
  exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp &lt;AHC>. He said most of
  the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking
  which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point
  that they have become unattractive.
      U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon
  Corp &lt;XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> jumped
  1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco &lt;TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal
  Corp &lt;UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY>
  climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp &lt;AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4.
      Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to
  71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4.
  Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its
  offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it
  would not raise the 70 dlr bid.
      British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8.
      Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in
  the first place indicates that the British oil giant has
  changed its outlook for the oil industry.
      Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the
  more bearish positions on oil prices.
      ""They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a
  barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty
  retreat from that point of view,"" Margoshes said.
      ""They are more appropriately today looking more
  optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs
  (long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that
  will be exceeded,"" Margoshes said.
      The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was
  trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel.
      Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy
  up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when
  oil prices were falling last year.
      They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly
  more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil
  field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in
  the Alaskan North Slope.
      Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely
  attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and
  has hard-to-replace reserves.
      ""I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to
  increase their position in the U.S. market,"" Dean Witter
  analyst Eugene Nowak said.
      Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of the
  British government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP
  stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding
  sometime in the year beginning April one.
      After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserves
  would be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is
  held in the U.S.
      ""The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it
  into the United States. No other market can handle all that
  stock,"" said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua.
      In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on
  revenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the year
  earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs.

  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may have
  been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen's renewed rapid
  rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States,
  political analysts said.
      Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reform
  plan, may now be forced to resign before the June economic
  summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later
  next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal
  Democratic Party (LDP), they said.
      ""The close relationship between Nakasone and President
  Reagan was an important element of Nakasone's power base,""
  Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida
  told Reuters. ""So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damages
  Nakasone.""
      Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone was
  encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but
  also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax.
      ""Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from
  Nakasone,"" Uchida said. ""His position within the LDP itself is
  not so strongly established today.""
      Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general public
  than with many LDP members, is now seeing his public support
  eroded, the analysts said.
      The yen's rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat on
  Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in
  retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a microchip trade
  pact are now giving Nakasone's critics fresh ammunition, the
  analysts said.
      ""Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and
  Nakasone hasn't worked effectively,"" Rei Shiratori, director of
  the Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said.
      This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone's
  credibility, Shiratori told Reuters.
      The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen's
  rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses
  in the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said.
      ""If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have to
  resign early,"" Shiratori said.
      But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempers
  before or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29,
  some analysts said.
      However, ""unless the Japanese political system can move more
  quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to
  Washington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a very
  hostile audience,"" said Merrill Lynch Securities economist
  William Sterling.
      ""If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put the
  final nail in his coffin,"" he said.
      Reagan's own weakened domestic position, and growing
  Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argue
  against a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analysts
  said.
      But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupled
  with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to
  Nakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over the
  differences and aid Nakasone, they said.
      ""One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is
  not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave,"" Sterling said.

  Commodities from gold to grains to
  cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses
  in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of
  inflation and economic instability.
      Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New
  York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a
  troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.
      A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that
  inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations
  to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve
  Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,
  Harris Upham and Co., in New York.
      The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from
  the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their
  commitment to support its value, and despite reports of
  intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.
      Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known
  as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term
  direction of the currency markets.
      ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""If
  they do, it's not evident.""
      ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market
  take values to where they should be.
      ""One way or another, we will force our major trading
  partners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correct
  the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.
      ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long
  time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's
  going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's
  happening,"" he said.
      The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities
  cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.
      At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds
  saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning
  to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty
  McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of
  Dominick and Dominick.
      The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout
  the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton
  posted broad gains.
      Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the
  grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome
  supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate
  export demand.
      After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department
  raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by
  two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.
      Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the
  Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately
  higher.
      Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said
  hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at
  this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field
  work to market animals.

      ""I'd say it's 99 plus pct sure that it (the tariffs) will

      Sergey Frolov, chief economist at Amtorg Trading Corp, an
  agent for Soviet trade organisations and industries, told a
  U.S.-USSR business meeting the Soviet Union produces few items
  that western nations want.
      But reforms, including upgrading the quality of goods and
  allowing joint ventures with foreign firms, will encourage
  modest export gains in future.
      Frolov said the Soviet Union exported 500 mln dlrs worth of
  goods to the United States in 1986 and imported 1.5 billion
  dlrs worth. He gave no trade forecast for 1987.
      But he said that even if all obstacles were removed, total
  trade between the two countries would remain between two and
  three billion dlrs a year.
      ""The post-detente embargoes have taught the USSR to limit
  its trading with the U.S.,"" he said.

  The U.S. Treasury proposed allowing 
  temporary imports of South African uranium ore and uranium
  oxide until July 1 under certain conditions pending
  clarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by Congress last
  fall.
      The Treasury said it proposed allowing the temporary
  imports because it felt Congress had not intended when it
  passed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall
  -- overriding President Reagan's veto -- to hurt U.S. industry.
      The Treasury said an outright U.S. ban of uranium ore and
  oxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert their
  South African origin ore and oxide to other countries including
  the Soviet Union for processing.
      The Treasury also proposed allowing U.S.-origin goods to be
  imported temporarily from South African state-controlled
  organizations for repair or servicing in the U.S.
      The South African sanctions law, enacted by the U.S. to
  protest the apartheid laws of racial segregation practiced by

  GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-Warner
  Corp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to
  be preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company.
       Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for
  4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch
  Capital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for
  89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and
  securities for the balance.
      Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.
      ""I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in
  with another bid,"" said one analyst, who values the company at
  51 or 52 dlrs per share.
      GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of
  Borg-Warner's stock.
      ""You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up
  the price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have
  to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking
  at it - that it's worth more,"" Pershing and Co analyst Richard
  Henderson said.
      Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.
      GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill
  Lynch officials did not return phone calls.
      Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman
  sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics
  business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as
  telephones, computer terminals, and appliances.
      ""Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical
  operation these days,"" said Henderson.
      ""He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he
  does not like to get pushed around,"" said Henderson.
      GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover
  of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF
  did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its
  investment in Carbide.
      Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its
  Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer
  and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would
  give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.
      ""It's a win-win situation,"" said one analyst.
      One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be
  forthcoming shortly.
      ""I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this
  book,"" he said.
      Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,
  protective services, which includes Wells Fargo security
  guards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
      Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows
  GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it
  would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per
  share.
      ""I think there's a probability he goes up in price,"" said
  Rose.
      Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman
  would do. ""Sam's a low-risk, high-return player.""
      ""Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical
  enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,"" Rose
  said.
      Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add
  earnings momentum to GAF. ""I worked out that paying as much as
  50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if
  they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,"" said John
  Henry of E.F. Hutton.
      Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986
  operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion
  dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net
  earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.
      ""The Borg chemical business is great,"" said Rose, adding
  its only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co &lt;MCT> and Dow
  Chemical Co &lt;DOW>.

  J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its
  first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its
  previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status
  its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.
      That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest
  payments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20
  mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the
  first three months of 1986.
      Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities
  underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln
  dlrs in the year-earlier period.
      In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading
  losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and
  underwriting of Euromarket securities.
      Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained
  difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering
  heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether
  Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.
      On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan
  losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign
  exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and
  trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.
      Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and
  commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net
  investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.
      Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first
  quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell
  to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.
      If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means
  that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are
  actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9
  mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume
  payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.
      After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for
  credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared
  with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.
      It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after
  charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49
  mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.
      Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were
  583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year
  earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from
  303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to

  The European Community Commission said
  it has opened an enquiry into allegations that the Soviet Union

      The Commission said its decision follows a complaint from
  EC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Soviet
  mercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in the
  European industry.
      According to the complaint, Soviet mercury sales in the EC
  had risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes between
  August and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of
  the EC market if they continue at the same pace.
      The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than
  40 pct below prices charged by EC producers, forcing them to
  cut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. The
  imports had caused producers heavy financial losses, it said.
      The Commission said the industry would probably be unable
  to hold prices at current levels and that any increase would
  result in loss of sales and jobs.
      The so-called anti-dumping procedure opened by the
  Commission will allow all interested parties to state their

  Exxon Corp, the world's largest oil
  company, said in a published interview today that it was
  reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to
  close on of its french refineries.
      Lee R. Raymond, Exxon's new president, singled out the
  possibility of a closure of one of Exxon's refineries in France
  during the interview.
      An Exxon spokeswoman confirmed that Raymond had
  specifically mentioned refineries in France but said that no
  specific refinery had been named. She also said that all of
  Exxon's opertations were under constant review.
      Exxon currently has two refineries in France, FOS in the
  mediterranean with a capcity of 175,000 barrels per day and
  Port Jerome west of paris with a similar capacity.
      Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an influential trade
  journal, said, in its current issue, that they understood that
  Exxon was looking at the possibility of refinery closures in
  Antwerp, Southern France or possibly Italy.
      Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers inc said
  that with the closures Exxon made in 1986 in Europe and the
  improvement in the European refining situation, its future
  profits there should be good.
      ""Exxon and other major oil companies have closed a bunch of
  refineries in Europe, upgraded the rest and shaken many of the
  indepedents out of the market. Now with demand for products
  rising and efficient operations, Exxon should show superior
  earnings,"" Mlotok said.
      ""Just after Royal Dutch &lt;RD>, they are seen as one of the
  highest grade refiners in Europe,"" he added.
      Industry sources said that the oil companies were likely to
  feel greater pressure on their operations in Southern Europe
  where competition from the OPEC countries is increasing as
  these producers move further into downstream operations.
      PIW said that refiners in the Mediterranean can expect
  increased shipments from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC export
  refineries.
      PIW said ""sales from Libya, Algeria and elsewhere are
  expected to reclaim markets lost to Italian and other European

  The tough trade sanctions President
  Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across
  Japan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade
  practices worldwide, U.S. officials said.
      But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings
  Institution, a think tank, said ""a shot across their bow can
  often result in a shot in our stern.""
      He said it left the United States open to retaliation.
      The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered
  on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress
  that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws,
  and no new protectionist legislation is needed.
      In the past year tough trade action had been taken against
  the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer
  and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights,
  patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.
      White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the
  tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a ""serious signal""
  to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.
      Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers,
  television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor
  an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at
  less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The
  tariffs were placed on items which were available from other
  sources so there would be little effect on the American
  consumer, Fitzwater said.
      Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action
  - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade
  practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.
      The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.
      The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion
  dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about
  one-third of America's overall deficit.
      But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West
  Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the
  president is ready to fight them all.
      Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that ""I regret
  that these actions are necessary,"" but that the health and
  vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to
  American competitiveness in world markets.
      ""We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading
  practices,"" Reagan added in the statement from his California
  vacation home at Santa Barbara.
      He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan
  abided by the agreement.
      U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -
  which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he
  already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.
      The White House aide said of the tariff action, ""it wasn't
  done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade
  practice.""
      The aide added, however, ""on another plane, it was an
  example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight
  unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major
  overall of our trade laws.""
      But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not
  in the best interests of the United States, and that
  negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.
      ""It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,"" he
  said, ""because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in
  trade.""
      Crandall said, ""the administration is doing this for its
  political impact across the country, and therefore its impact
  on Congress.""
      He said, ""I don't think it makes a lot of sense.""
      But other analysts said it made little difference whether
  the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,
  and that the main point was that the trading partners were on
  notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.
      Spokesman Fitzwater said ""we don't want a trade war,"" but the
  imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when
  it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

  A specially convened Franco-German

      The meeting was attended by farm ministers and foreign

  Helmut Kohl of West Germany.
      The stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key to

  World Bank president Barber Conable
  pledged the Bank's support to help Indonesia adjust to lower

  protected economy was needed.
      Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto,
  he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the
  economy and deregulate trade policy.
      Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which
  cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third
  World's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs
  from the World Bank in the past 20 years.
      Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300
  mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was
  prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to
  lower oil and primary commodity prices.
      ""We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are
  consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy,"" he
  said.
      He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after last
  year's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the
  difficulties now faced by other countries.
      Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the
  dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and
  has announced a series of measures since May intended to
  stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise
  the economy.

  said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years.
      Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told

  Brooklyn Union Gas Co, a New York gas
  utility, will see its gas costs up sharply as a result of
  Transco Energy Co's &lt;E> decision to close its pipelines to
  transport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said.
      Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in the
  United States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, or
  non-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spot
  supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,
  analysts said.
      Texas Eastern pipelines &lt;TET>, the other competing
  pipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the South
  closed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union has
  relied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.
       In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrs
  per mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gas
  costs four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said.
      Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open
  access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear
  of accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities.
      Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for
  gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers.
      Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount of
  supplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, a
  Brooklyn Union official said.
      Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said
  most of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed through
  to rate payers.
      While net effect on the company will not be known for
  several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,
  end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,
  will end up paying more for gas, he said.
      Because the closure takes place in summer months when gas
  demand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would be
  small, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson Lufkin
  Jenrette, said.
      If the situation persists into winter heating season, high
  cost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said.
      Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco for
  spot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co &lt;NCNG>,
  Piedmont Natural Gas Co &lt;PNY>, will face the same high cost
  factor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager with
  end users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokering
  firm, said.
      ""But these companies are not unwitting victims of the
  take-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers,"" he said.
      Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's request
  for an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facility
  for spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.
      Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas will
  threaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to
  alternative fuels, he said.
      In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the
  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is being
  negotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said.
      Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas
  for them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory
  on the inventory charge, he said.
      ""Cool heads will prevail,"" DLJ's Launer said, "" but it may
  take a while.""

  The dollar will decline over the next
  two to three years, but this is unlikely to result in a
  complete reduction of the U.S. current account deficit, said
  Anthony Solomon, chairman of S.G. Warburg (USA) Inc and former
  president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
      In a presentation to the Japan Society, Solomon said
  without elaboration that he expects a ""significant decline in
  the dollar,"" within the next three years.
      ""The dollar will fall more, but the current account deficit
  will stop being reduced when it reaches its structural core,""
  he said.
      Solomon described the structural core as about one-half of
  the current 150 billion dlr annual deficit. He cited several
  factors which will prevent an elimination of the deficit.
      For one thing, it is unlikely that there will be any new
  investment in those manufacturing industries that shrank when
  the dollar was at uncompetitive levels, he said.
      In addition, he said that the U.S. has an increased
  propensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes.
      Solomon forecast inflation at 4.5 pct by year-end, but said
  it could be kept below five pct in the medium-term if oil
  prices are stable and commodity values remain low.

  The Brazilian Coffee Institute,
  IBC, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system when
  it reopens export registrations, probably later this week,
  exporters said.
      They said IBC President Jorio Dauster is likely to leave
  the basic formula for the minimum registration price unchanged
  but raise the contribution quota to partially offset the
  effects of cruzado devaluation since April registrations were
  closed in mid-February.
      To fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have to
  be around 28 dlrs per bag against 7.0 when registrations closed.
      However, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contribution
  quota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets,
  and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, the
  exporters said.
      They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contribution
  quota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnet
  funds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteed
  producer price.
      Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide more
  funds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds last
  week, funds are still being released for subsequent approval.
      The sources said it is still unclear when registrations
  will be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end of
  this week.
      ""Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentions
  know. A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanently
  closed down,"" one exporter said.
      However, before announcing its export policy the IBC is
  likely to wait to see if tomorrow's meeting of the
  International Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board in
  London decides to call a full council meeting to discuss
  reintroduction of export quotas, sources said.
      There is also talk of the announcement this week of new
  measures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could be
  awaiting clarification before making any move, the exporters
  said.
      Another factor which could be delaying the opening of
  registrations is the current strike by bank workers which,
  while not affecting current shipments, could affect
  documentation and currency operations for new sales.
      This would certainly be the case if the IBC was considering
  obliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two or
  three days of registering a sale.

  India is searching for non-communist
  countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
  conserve foreign exchange.
      Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and
  electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are
  all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,
  chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.
      Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in
  1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading
  Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).
      ""The two state trading corporations are free to use their
  buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
  exports,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that
  private firms are excluded from countertrading.
      One trade source said India has targetted countries that
  depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
  imports. But countertrade deals still make up only a small part
  of India's total trading and are likely to account for less
  than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade
  during the nine months ended December, the sources said.
      Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65
  billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,
  against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.
      However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern
  Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.
      Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of
  agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude
  oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87.

  Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
  said OPEC's December agreement to stabilize oil prices at 18
  dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there
  was no immediate need to change it.
      Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news
  agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three
  mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC
  quota.
      Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will
  continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members
  adhere to the pact, Nazer said.
      The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production
  ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices
  averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.
      Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki
  Yamani last October, said: ""I do not foresee any need for new
  measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting
  will take place as scheduled.""
      Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all
  members were abiding by its agreements.
      ""We've heard news every now and then of violations but they
  were not at all verified,"" he said.
      OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a
  13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near
  18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.
      Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but
  have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as
  traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.
      Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its
  4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.
      ""As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as
  devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to
  the agreement,"" he said.
      Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the
  Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating
  storage, Nazer said.
      King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and
  Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price
  stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful
  competition with OPEC.
      ""Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly
  desires price stability,"" he said.
      Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had
  returned to a role of ""swing producer"" within OPEC.
      Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln
  bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and
  over-production by some OPEC states.
      ""Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played
  by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8
  mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other
  members of OPEC,"" Nazer said.
      Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third
  quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.
      But he said if circumstances changed ""I am sure then the
  OPEC members will consult with each other and take the
  necessary measures.""
      Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when
  demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern
  hemisphere spring and summer.
      Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation
  from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union
  agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after
  he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.
      ""We did not ask any country to do anything. These were
  programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market
  conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing
  conditions,"" Nazer said.
      He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate
  -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if
  they saw fit.

  The House Ways and Means Committee
  is moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said was
  intended to help open foreign markets to U.S. agricultural
  goods and to modify some U.S. agricultural trade laws.
      The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan to
  take into account the potential harm to U.S. agricultural
  exports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreign
  unfair trade practices against other domestic industries.
      The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seek
  government monitoring of imports if there is a reasonable
  chance the industry would be harmed by an import surge.
      The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the bill
  next week and congressional sources said they expect it will be
  approved.
       In investigations involving a processed agricultural
  product, trade associations of processors or producers would
  have to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfair
  duties.
       The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives for
  the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on
  Tariffs and Trade. It would seek fair trade in agriculture,
  seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and
  export practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas and
  non-tariff barriers.
       President Reagan's authority to negotiate a new GATT
  agreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority
  to negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended
  through January 3, 1991.
      The bill extends Reagan's authority to negotiate an
  international coffee agreement through October 31, 1989.
      It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugar
  imported from November 1, 1977 to March 31, 1985 for production
  of sugar or products containing sugar and destined for
  re-export. The export of the sugar or products must occur
  before Octoer 1, 1991.
      Presently, to qualify for the refund the sugar must be
  processed within three years after import and exported within
  five years.
      Agriculture would also benefit from more rapid decisions in
  complaints of unfair foreign trade practices or injury from
  imports.

  Uganda's Coffee Marketing Board (CMB)
  has stopped offering coffee on the international market because
  it is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.
      The board suspended offerings last week but because of its
  urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it
  could sustain, the sources added.
      Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been
  waiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has had
  trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the
  Kenyan port of Mombasa.
      Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by
  holding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings from
  coffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said.
      The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money
  and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty
  for such delays, it added.
      Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that
  commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings
  -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the
  current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100
  billion.
      The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of
  annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment.
      The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's export
  earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is
  likely to more than offset an expected increase in production.
      CMB officials have forecast that because the government has
  restored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda will
  produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending
  September 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.

  Roughly half of this year's expected
  130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,
  a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the
  Netherlands, told Reuters.
      Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date
  for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April
  23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman
  added.
      ""It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can
  expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the
  crop is off to a very good start,"" he said.
      Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600
  hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of
  white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined ""A""
  and ""B"" quota of 872,000 tonnes.
      This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been
  introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000
  hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000
  tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota ""C"" sugar produced.
      Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been

  A study group said the United States

      U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750
  mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the
  economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise.
      The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a private
  group, also called for new research for oil exploration and
  development techniques.
      It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a

  imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption.
      The study cited two basic policy paths for the nation: to
  protect the U.S. industry through an import fee or other such
  device or to accept the full economic benefits of cheap oil.
      But the group did not strongly back either option, saying
  there were benefits and drawbacks to both.

  South Yemen is planning a major oil
  pipeline system to be completed in 18-months time to start
  exports at a initial rate of 100,000 barrels per day, (bpd) the
  Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said.
      MEES said government approval for the export pipeline
  followed a visit to Aden by a high ranking delegation from the
  Soviet Union, which will help South Yemen construct the line
      The engineering studies for the pipeline are nearly
  finished and construction is expected to start early next year,
  the industry newsletter said.
      The pipeline will run about 170-200 kms (105-125 miles)
  from Shabwa oilfields to a coastal terminal at Bir 'Ali on the
  Gulf of Aden, MEES said.
       MEES said the Soviet firm Technoexport, which is
  developing oilfileds for South Yemen, has substantially
  increased its initial reserve estimates and recommended a
  pipeline with an eventual 500,000 bpd capacity.
      The discovery of commercial quaotities of oil was confirmed
  by Technoexport earlier this year in three structures in the
  Shabwa region in the Northwestern part of the country, 200 kms
  east of North Yemen's Alif oilfield.

  compared with 262 mln in April 1986.
      The smoothed seasonally adjusted series shows a surplus on
  merchandise trade of 145 mln dlrs against 135 mln dlrs in March
  and 30 mln dlrs in April 1986.
      Seasonally adjusted but non-smoothed figures show a

  The ruling GATT Council deferred a
  decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a
  European Community complaint against the U.S.- Japanese
  agreement on exports of computer semiconductors.
      David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main parties
  would continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope of
  resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.
      The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect
  the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips,
  officially known as semiconductors.
      The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by
  allowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum
  prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries.
      The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave
  U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.
      Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland,
  Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC
  complaint during the heated Council debate.
      Japan's delegate, Minoru Endo, and U.S. Ambassador Michael

  The head of Spain's employers'
  federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried
  about the government's monetary policies because high real
  interest rates were hampering investment.
      He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this
  year were not endangering the government's five pct inflation
  target. The government's perceived need to control inflation by
  keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.
      High real interest rates were attracting an influx of
  speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the
  government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.
      Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,
  liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17
  pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a
  target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.
      To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money
  rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from
  11.8 at end-1986.
      Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to
  hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,
  with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new
  wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.
      These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish
  workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.
      He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the
  state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five
  pct wage ceiling.
      Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in
  Spain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first
  two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct
  increase over the corresponding period last year.
      However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the
  peseta to correct the imbalance.

  A year after squeezing to power with a
  narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques
  Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations
  choking the French economy.
      But France is still waiting for a promised industrial
  recovery the government says will follow from its free market
  policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But
  so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year
  and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct
  in 1986, is uncertain.
      Forced last month to cut the government's 1987 growth
  target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister
  Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But
  some government supporters say they fear time for an economic
  miracle may be running out.
      The political clock is ticking towards Presidential
  elections due by April next year.
      France's economic performance, led by a mixed cast of
  right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed
  reviews from non-partisan analysts.
      For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at
  newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government's outstanding
  achievement has been to launch ""a veritable intellectual
  revolution"" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of
  state control.
      ""The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad --
  but set in their context of structural reforms, they are
  excellent,"" Develle said.
      But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief
  architect of the government's free market policies, may be
  pursuing a mirage.
      ""The belief that economic liberalism will produce an
  explosion of economic forces is ideological"" said Indosuez chief
  economist Jean Cheval. ""Personally I think it's an illusion.
  Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system,
  from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible.""
      Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard.
  Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls
  have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been
  pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely
  popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks
  and industries to private investors.
      Since December, nearly five mln French investors have
  bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA> and glass
  maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA &lt;SGEP.PA>, the first two state
  companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion
  franc five-year privatisation plan.
      Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of
  capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has
  flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift
  the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since
  December.
      At the end of last year the government abolished price
  controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car
  repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small
  businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy.
      The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices
  in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the
  official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or
  less.
      ""But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you
  consider that prices are now free for the first time since
  1945,"" commented Develle of Paribas.
      Other achievements include a major reduction in the state's
  foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1
  billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and
  down from 153.3 billion in 1985.
      But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a
  gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French
  franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating
  three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second
  since Chirac took power.
      A recent report by the Organisation for Economic
  Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for
  failing to produce the goods that its potential customers
  wanted.
      Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology
  sectors, French industrial goods were ""increasingly ill-adapted
  to demand"" and over-priced, the report said.
      French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed
  with the report. ""One of the assumptions of the government is
  that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and
  modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like
  freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go,"" he said.
      And despite rising industrial investment and the
  introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment,
  the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7
  million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier.
      The problem for the government is that there may be little
  more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth.
      French producers failed more than most to take advantage of
  last year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the
  shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like
  West Germany and Japan, they say.

  Soviet winter grains could be off to
  a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall
  and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said.
      Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the
  Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to
  forecast any major crop problems, analysts said.
      But the situation bears careful watching over the next six
  weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and
  future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said.
      ""From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that
  the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a
  lower crop (than last year),"" Gail Martell, chief meteorologist
  for E.F. Hutton said.
      The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will
  be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of
  the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.
      ""Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of
  us,"" an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.
      The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares
  of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.
  This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop
  and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the
  USDA analyst said.
      With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able
  to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts
  noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops
  -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.
      Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover
  combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however,
  snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,
  so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been
  due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.
      ""Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation
  between mediocre crops and fall dryness,"" Martell said.
      Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal
  in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the
  entire winter crop area, she said.
      Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the
  snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused 
  problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior
  forecaster for Accu Weather, said.
      Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the
  fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures,
  the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would
  require longer off-pasture feeding, they said.
      ""The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they
  don't have to buy (grains) now,"" a USDA official said.
      But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and
  if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a
  one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet
  buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.
      Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the
  Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said.
      ""A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and
  a half,"" Martell said.

  Japan today announced another mammoth
  monthly trade surplus that economists said would be sure to
  intensify already mounting pressure on the country for action.
      ""The world has every reason to be furious with Japan for not
  moving more quickly,"" Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd economist
  Eric Rasmussen said.
      The Finance Ministry said today that the trade surplus
  soared to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion in
  January and 4.77 billion a year ago.
      The current account surplus, which includes trade in
  services as well as goods, climbed to 7.38 billion dlrs last
  month from 4.95 billion in January and 3.89 billion a year ago.
      After being adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, the figures
  look a bit better, but not much. On that basis, the trade
  surplus declined slightly in February to 9.16 billion dlrs from
  a record 9.58 billion in January.
      ""In the medium term we expect this modest improvement to
  continue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward off
  further protectionism or further yen strength,"" said William
  Stirling, economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.
      A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive on
  world markets while making imports into the country cheaper.
      ""On a seasonally adjusted basis, we appear to be making some
  progress on getting exports down,"" Jardine's Rasmussen said.
      But imports do not seem to be picking up much because the
  Japanese economy remains sluggish, he said.
      Finance Ministry officials blamed last month's slower
  import growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners worked
  off stocks they had built up in January.
      The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume of
  exports last month, after an unexpected year-on-year increase
  in January.
      This means the effects of the two-year rise of the yen
  against the U.S. Dollar are finally beginning to have an impact
  on exports, they said.
      But economists warned that may not be soon enough for
  Japan's trading partners.

  Venezuela will lend Ecuador up to 12.5

  Minister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement.
      Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline
  connecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port of
  Balao was damaged last week by an earthquake.
      Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for a

  would take an estimated five  months.
      Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude for

  repay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired.
      Both countries are the only Latin American members of the

      The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill

      The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee

  A takeover battle began today for
  debt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> as TransCanada
  PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO> announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer and
  Dome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers.
      Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential
  buyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A> which is 70
  pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON.N>, &lt;PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd>
  which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd
  &lt;CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>.
      Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another
  proposal from ""a substantial company"" and discussions with a
  third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a
  statement.
      The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid,
  but did not identify the companies involved in talks.
      TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline
  operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common
  and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which
  would own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer
  is to Dome management, not to shareholders.
      Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,
  totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.
  It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.
      Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement ""violated
  the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered
  into with prospective purchasers"" and was apparently timed to
  prevent Dome from considering other proposals.
      It said the TransCanada bid ""seems to require favourable and
  substantial taxation concessions from the federal and
  provincial governments."" But Dome added that its management and
  financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.
      TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he
  was surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied
  that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. ""I find (Dome's
  statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to
  authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce
  it,"" he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the
  other bidders, or the terms of other offers.
      Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the
  Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at
  5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.

  Brazil's state-oil company,
  Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi
  Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees
  from the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said.
      Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the
  Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such
  conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of
  its commercial debts last month.
      The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oil
  consumption in Brazil.
      But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and
  decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras
  will lift the order to cancel the shipment.
      Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms by
  Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere.
      ""Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since
  1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much
  better for us, because with the market prices more or less the
  same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage,"" he said.
      Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing
  Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing
  from Brazil, he said.
      Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry
  workers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras
  oil stocks are ""reasonably balanced."" 
      Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, with
  an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000
  bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd.
      ""If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship, fine, I
  am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers

  A trade bill before the United States
  House of Representatives ""is a very dangerous bill for Canadian
  industry,"" Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam
  Zimmerman told reporters.
      By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S.
  countervailing duty law, House of Representatives Bill 3
  removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely
  used government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing.
      ""Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grant
  rights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could be
  vulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language,"" he
  said.
      The Canadian forest lobby's Zimmerman also said the House
  of Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuring
  subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any
  countervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadian
  resource exports to the U.S.
      Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices and
  U.S. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, he
  said. Such a method would make Canadian resource industries
  vulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export tax
  imposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumber
  to the U.S., Zimmerman added.
      Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a U.S.
  forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervail
  duty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber.
      ""We represent the first victim of the move to price other
  countries' natural resources according to the U.S. system,""
  Zimmerman said.
      ""If we're an example, than other resource industries had
  better watch out,"" he added.

  A prolonged dry spell has damaged
  111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces
  in the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officials
  said.
      They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce
  estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of
  rainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing
  conditions continued until next month.
      Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the
  losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in
  other, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry
  spell.
      Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),
  representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8
  mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.
      About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at
  170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.
      Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been
  hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total
  thus the damage is considered negligible.
      In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by
  production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified
  into the cash crop from sugar two years ago.
       The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut production
  in the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to
  320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were no
  reports of actual damage.

  French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac
  opened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus on
  superpower arms control moves and trade issues.
      French officials said a major aim of Chirac's visit was to
  present France's concern that the United States might ignore
  European security interests in any accord with Moscow on
  removing medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent.
      But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will not
  agree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would give
  the Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomats
  said.
      France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missiles
  from Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge in
  other weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets,
  conventional forces and chemical weapons.
      Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French position
  saying: ""Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should
  mention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles.""
      Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a
  dispute between two leading research institutes over patent
  rights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS.
      In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the Pasteur
  Institute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, of
  Bethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties from
  the test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight
  against AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).
      ""This agreement opens a new era in Franco-American
  cooperation, allowing France and the United States to join
  their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of
  speeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure,"" Reagan
  said at the signing ceremony. 
      He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80
  per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation.
      The foundation would also raise private funds and would
  donate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in less
  developed countries. 
      Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and the
  United States during a welcoming ceremony in the White House
  East Room, with Reagan describing France as ""America's oldest
  ally in war and peace."" 
      ""I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by the
  same ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangers
  which we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, new
  diseases and drugs,"" Chirac replied.
      But the two countries are likely to have less to agree on
  over the issue of trade, where Chirac is worried about a rise
  in protectionism in the U.S. Congress. 
      A senior U.S. official yesterday dismissed a French idea to
  sell cut-price grain to poor countries in Africa as a way of
  lessening surplus stocks.
      Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea, first
  proposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume,
  during his two-day visit to Washington.
      The U.S. official described the idea as a ""grain producers'
  OPEC"" -- a reference to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
  Countries -- and said it went against the Reagan
  administration's desire to lessen government intervention in
  trade.

  Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level
  trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are
  growing increasingly irritated with each other.
      The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the
  whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way
  for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day
  stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China.
      Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure,
  the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to
  reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.
      ""We appreciate their frustration,"" a senior Japanese
  government official said. ""But we are also frustrated.""
      The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last
  18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash
  spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad.
  That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade,
  but it will, he said.
      He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress
  that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that
  remain when it talks with Congress.
      ""It would only take five minutes to list their
  accomplishments,"" a senior U.S. Official replied.
      The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the
  economic structures of both countries and how they affect the
  bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48
  billion dlrs in Japan's favour.
      On the following two days, the topics will range from
  multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade
  problems as super computers.
      The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling
  discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include
  savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and
  housing, and the implications of government budget deficits.
      These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the
  Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic
  pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and
  stimulate the sagging economy by spending more.
      Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of
  boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.
      Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge
  U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade
  imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is
  buying more imports.
      Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft
  trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial
  trade practices. ""It condemns Japan without due process,"" one
  Japanese official said.
      That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out
  bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.
      Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's
  trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal
  access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade
  action by the U.S., Officials said.
      Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak
  bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill
  overhanging them.
      ""We have no leverage,"" one official admitted.
      As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints
  about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including
  super computers.
      The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese
  super computer market.
      The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to
  public institutions like universities which buy the
  sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up
  informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential
  sellers, officials said.

  International Coffee Organization, ICO,

  Lindenberg Sette said.
      The Brazilian delegate said several producers requested the

      Talks to restore quotas collapsed early last month when
  producers and consumers failed to resolve differences on how
  quotas should be allocated.
