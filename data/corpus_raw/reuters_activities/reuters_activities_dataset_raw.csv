  Mounting trade friction between the
  U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting
  nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic
  damage, businessmen and officials said.
      They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.
  Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the
  U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.
      But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt
  them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be
  their gain.
      The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on
  imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in
  retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not
  to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.
      Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs
  at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms
  said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the
  new taxes.
      ""We wouldn't be able to do business,"" said a spokesman for
  leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric
  Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>.
      ""If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time
  beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of
  exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,"" said Tom
  Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;James
  Capel and Co>.
      In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.
      ""We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against
  Japan because it serves as a warning to us,"" said a senior
  Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.
      Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last
  year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.
      The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves
  to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.
      ""We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and
  cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we
  want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,"" said
  Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>.
      A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion
  association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan
  might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports
  are similar to those of Japan.
      Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion
  dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.
      In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough
  curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of
  semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the
  U.S.
      In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been
  selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics
  manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such
  a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by
  further U.S. Pressure to block imports.
      ""That is a very short-term view,"" said Lawrence Mills,
  director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.
      ""If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will
  be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong
  is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,"" he said.
      The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,
  accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.
      The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade
  talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,
  Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.
      ""This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two
  countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very
  serious matter,"" Button said.
      He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,
  Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant
  U.S. Exports to that country.
      Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the
  trade stand-off continue.
      Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined
  a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.
      The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget
  and record public works spending in the first half of the
  financial year.
      They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency
  measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.
      Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto
  Kuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and
  Industry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an
  effort to end the dispute.

  The Ministry of International Trade and
  Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand
  outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese
  energy demand, ministry officials said.
      MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy
  supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600
  mln, they said.
      The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in
  Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen
  and a decline in domestic electric power demand.
      MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand
  outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the
  Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.
      They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy
  supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.
      Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric power
  in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27
  pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and
  liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.

  Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5
  billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a
  year ago, the Business Economics Department said.
      It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht
  from 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this
  year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials
  and semi-finished products.
      The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the
  first quarter due to lower oil prices.
      The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6
  billion baht from 56.6 billion.
      Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower
  earnings from many key commodities including rice whose
  earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26
  pct and canned pineapples seven pct.
      Products registering high export growth were jewellery up

  Indonesia expects crude palm oil (CPO)
  prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne FOB
  sometime this year because of better European demand and a fall
  in Malaysian output, Hasrul Harahap, junior minister for tree
  crops, told Indonesian reporters.
      Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332
  dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said.
      Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despite
  making recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that it
  could possibly increase its international market share.
      Indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil
  after Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure
  supplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.
      Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary
  shortage than to lose export markets.
      Indonesian exports of CPO in calendar 1986 were 530,500
  tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bank
  figures.

  The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is
  likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and
  possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian
  Nainggolan said.
      He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in
  palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.
      Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil
  may also be introduced. But he said the question was still
  being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no
  decision on when to go ahead had been made.
      The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber
  physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.
      ""Several factors make us move cautiously,"" Nainggolan said.
  ""We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a
  mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.""
      Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee
  added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to
  five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are
  traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,
  exchange officials said.
      The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the
  introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one
  official said a feasibility study was needed first. No
  decisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April
  23, traders said.
      Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the
  world's second largest producer of natural rubber, should
  expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of
  the exchange would help this.
      Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost
  overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.
      He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to
  encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would
  also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to
  encourage participation.
      Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start
  although trading in coffee has been disappointing.
      Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in
  April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9
  mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered
  locally, the latest exchange report said.
       Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905
  tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah.
       Total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and
  44 traders.

  Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> is certain to
  lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of
  its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.
      Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9
  trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank
  with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in
  October.
      But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu
  told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its
  position.
      ""We'll be back in position in first place within three
  years,"" Komatsu said in an interview.
      He said that while the merger will initially reduce
  Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand
  Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where
  it has been relatively weak.
      But financial analysts are divided on whether and how
  quickly the gamble will pay off.
      Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in
  view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger
  was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch
  network from scratch.
      The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has
  expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business
  and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the
  wisdom of some of those moves.
      ""They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now
  it's largely out of their hands,"" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd
  financial analyst Simon Smithson.
      Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to
  enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American
  investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.
      Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5
  pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at
  least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange
  personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.
      ""The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the
  Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,"" said one analyst.
      But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.
      ""U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,
  we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three
  years, not until the 21st century,"" Komatsu said.
      Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes
  into the securities business at home.
      Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's
  version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial
  from investment banking.
      But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu
  said he hopes further deregulation will create new
  opportunities.
      ""We need to find new business chances,"" Komatsu said. ""In some
  cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust
  bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.""
      Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such
  domestic securities business as profitable government bond
  dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co
  Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.
      He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering
  the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank
  subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.
       The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to
  securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,
  following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European
  universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.
      But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar
  decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.
      ""We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed
  in two or three years,"" he said.
      Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand
  lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to
  replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.
      The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of
  time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the
  merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.
      ""It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,"" said
  Kleinwort's Smithson.
      ""After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling
  around. It will be the next decade before we see if the
  strategy is right or wrong.""

  Bond Corp Holdings Ltd &lt;BONA.S> and Atlas
  Consolidated Mining and Development Corp &lt;ATLC.MN> are still
  holding talks on a bail-out package for the troubled mining
  firm, an Atlas statement said.
      Atlas, the Philippines' biggest copper producer, said it
  had been hit by depressed world copper prices. It reported a
  net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986,
  compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985.
      The company said it had been able to cut its losses because
  its scaled-down copper operations in the central island of Cebu
  started in the second half of 1986.
      Atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisition
  by Bond of the company's existing bank loans and their
  restructuring into a gold loan.
      A memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in
  October last year said Bond would acquire Atlas' total loans of
  275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold.
      Atlas said the two sides were also discussing equity
  infusion into Atlas and the creation of a development fund for
  further exploration and development of the company's gold
  properties in the central province of Masbate.
      Wilson Banks, general manager of &lt;Bond Corp International
  Ltd> in Hong Kong, told Reuters the Atlas statement on the
  negotiations was ""reasonably accurate.""
      Banks said Bond Corp was seriously considering several
  investments in the Philippines but did not give details.
      In its statement, Atlas said development of the pre-World
  War Two underground mines in Masbate had been accelerated and
  the ore tonnage had increased, extending the operation's life
  at least until 1993.

  Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered by
  U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will
  tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that
  liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,
  a senior ministry official said.
      ""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives
  by other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named,
  said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and
  it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise
  its farm import market,"" he said.
      Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.
  Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open
  its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to
  protect local farmers.
      Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat
  exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.
  End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.
      U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to
  visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask
  Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and
  remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.
      Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market
  share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has
  been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year
  beef accord next March 31.
      Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales
  from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports
  from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although
  the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.
      U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its
  beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain
  imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.
      An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when
  Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has
  the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.
  Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing
  some one billion dlrs in new business.
      The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import
  controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,
  purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,
  prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.
      To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's
  top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove
  residual import restrictions on agricultural products.
      But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional
  reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue
  should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the
  industrial sector.
      ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these
  issues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the official
  said.

  South Korea's trade surplus is growing too
  fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it
  down, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.
      He told a press conference the government planned to
  increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market
  to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold
  the surplus ""at a proper level.""
      But he said the government would not allow the won to
  appreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea has
  been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.
      The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with
  the U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3
  billion dlrs in 1985.
      Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects
  were bright for the South Korean economy, but the government
  would try to hold the current account surplus to around five
  billion dlrs a year for the next five years.
      ""Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five
  billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in
  exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But now
  the surplus is growing faster than we expected,"" he said.
      Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35
  pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this
  year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.
      Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to a
  surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr
  deficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the
  country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first
  time.
      South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs
  in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest
  in Asia.
      ""This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the
  major constraints on our development... Last year was a major
  turning point for the Korean economy,"" Kim said.
      Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of
  foreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from
  about 50 pct in 1986.
      ""The government, however, does not want to accelerate
  reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,"" he
  said.
      Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation
  and lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,
  particularly the United States.
      ""We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but
  we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a
  proper level,"" Kim said.

  Citibank A/S &lt;CCI.N>, the Norwegian
  subsidiary of the U.S.-based bank, said it made a net loss of
  just over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankers
  said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years.
      Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told
  Reuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries
  operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for
  investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic
  slump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices.
      Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in
  Norway since 1985.
      Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway's
  second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved
  later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would
  make profit this year.
      Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but
  Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned
  liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a
  steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
      Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank's &lt;CMB.N>
  subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavy
  losses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking.

  Kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden
  economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices
  will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists
  say.
      Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold
  oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the
  northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.
      Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross
  domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year
  after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.
      This was after taking into account inflation in consumer
  prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.
      Factors depressing economic activity include the
  6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, which
  threatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the
  Gulf and has sapped business confidence.
      But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September
  when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis
  caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive
  new debt settlement program was introduced.
      The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward
  trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.
      The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer
  spending, thus generating an informal credit system.
      Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are
  still owed by individuals and companies.
      There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)
  in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which
  one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as
  bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it
  will not allow any banks to go under.
      The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of
  problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether
  debtors have regular cash flows or not.
      Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights
  guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance
  in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector
  is the biggest after oil.
      Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride
  out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.
      Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)
  compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last
  year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.
      But strategic diversification into downstream operations in
  Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at
  home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell
  over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.
      Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average
  2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed
  product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as
  crude.
      Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason
  for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic
  inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent
  years and signs government spending on productive sectors will
  remain steady.
      External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8
  billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below
  that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit
  Gulf.
      Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put
  officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income
  of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.
      But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these
  reserves may not be enough to prevent a ""real"" budget deficit for
  the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.
      In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,
  revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,
  doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.
      This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded
  in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at
  up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some
  shortfall.
      Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for
  economic growth this year or next.
      ""It depends on oil prices,"" one said. ""This summer is
  important.""
      Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday
  the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state
  spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the
  economy.
      He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be
  spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.

  Malaysia is unlikely to meet its
  targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar
  1987, oil palm growers told Reuters.
      Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes,
  unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser
  and overstressed palms, they said.
      The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World
  newsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely to
  drop sharply this year.
      Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about
  115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell more
  palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the
  industry, a leading grower told Reuters.
      The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes
  against about 800,000 last March, the growers said.
      The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year
  due to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.
      The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean,
  is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous
  21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.
      In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expected
  to enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oil
  output peaks.
      They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow,
  with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees
  against 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reduction
  will not be felt for about another three years.

  A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) &lt;SANM.MN>
  to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut
  Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources
  in the Philippine food and brewery company said.
      A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB
  from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC's
  outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on
  April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former
  chairman of both SMC and UCPB.
      Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)
  and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.
      Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and
  represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB's
  plans to sell the shares to SMC were ""a serious breach of
  fiduciary duties.""
      The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be
  held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities
  and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a
  government nominee on the company's board.
      De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,
  asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by
  the company's board.
      On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the
  sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per
  share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained
  earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the
  purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of
  dividends.
      De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate
  an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt
  to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon
  del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would
  boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.
      In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier
  suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres
  Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.
      De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming
  last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong
  subsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.
  The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board
  meeting.
      An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to
  resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by
  April 15.
      ""The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of
  a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard
  of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early
  disposition of the sequestered shares,"" San Miguel Corp said in
  a statement.
      ""Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have
  reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of
  payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the
  government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement
  of the controversy by April 15,"" the statement added.
      A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on
  Cojuangco's court petition, adding: ""Any statement coming from
  us might be interpreted as adversarial.""
      Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which
  sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible
  to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United
  States citizen.
      The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln ""A"" shares,
  which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln ""B"" shares which
  are available to foreign buyers.
      SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among
  prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by
  the &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed
  institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers
  in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.
      The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on
  Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were
  owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President
  Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the
  U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend
  announced last June.
      ""We have no objection to Soriano buying the ""B"" shares,"" Diaz
  told Reuters. ""But everything is on hold now.""

  Good rains of one to four inches in the
  past 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in
  the Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland's central coast, an
  Australian Sugar Producers' Association spokesman said.
      As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a
  severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since
  December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet
  season.
      Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are
  beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth
  since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.
      Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better
  than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman
  said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain
  is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.
      Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region
  and southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and
  some mills are forecasting record crops, he said.
      Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled
  towards the end of May, he said.
      The cane crush normally runs from June to December.

  Senate Banking Committee Chairman
  William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce
  legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of
  corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.
      Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,
  Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased
  the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.
      ""We are proposing legislation that would provide for more
  disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would
  insure that takeovers are properly financed,"" he said.
      Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold
  for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a
  investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a
  company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within
  10 days, Proxmire said.
      In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement
  that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have
  to filed with the SEC.
      Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to
  prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in
  knowing about coming takeover attempts.
      Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a
  tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60
  business days from the current 20 business days.
      His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring
  company violated the time period on the tender offer.
      To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire
  said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin
  requirments are properly enforced.
      The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement
  for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally
  enforced in hostile takeovers.
      Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover
  declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without
  actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.
      He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for
  failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin
  requirements.
      The bill also would require more disclose when several
  investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.
      ""When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know
  about it,"" Proxmire said.
      Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain
  towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all
  shareholders recieve equal treatment.
      He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover
  defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.
      Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this
  month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring.
      He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this
  year.

  Bankers Trust New York Corp said it has
  placed its approximately 540 mln dlrs of medium- and long-term
  loans to Brazil on non-accrual status and that first-quarter
  net income will be reduced by about seven mln dlrs as a result.
      Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs
  of medium- and long-term debt on February 22.
      U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stop
  accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue,
  but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of ""the high
  potential of a continued suspension that would result in
  reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987.""
      Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are
  received for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated that
  full-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.
      Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiations
  between Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the
  resumption of interest payments.
      The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when central
  bank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a
  90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that

  Roughly half of this year's expected
  130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,
  a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the
  Netherlands, told Reuters.
      Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date
  for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April
  23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman
  added.
      ""It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can
  expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the
  crop is off to a very good start,"" he said.
      Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600
  hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of
  white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined ""A""
  and ""B"" quota of 872,000 tonnes.
      This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been
  introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000
  hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000
  tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota ""C"" sugar produced.
      Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been
  allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being
  boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.

  Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>,
  VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986
  dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per
  ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of
  a suspected foreign currency fraud.
      A spokesman said VW's supervisory board will meet tomorrow
  to discuss the payout.  A statement will be made afterwards.
      VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach
  their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln
  marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually
  the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit.
      When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it
  said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark
  dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would
  be proposed for the company's new preference shares.
      Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of
  the management board proposal as virtually a formality.
  ""Anything else would be more than a surprise,"" one said.
      Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to
  maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at
  around three billion marks at end-1985.

  The Zambian government has no immediate

  maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an
  official of the ruling party said.
      Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for
  refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in
  which at least 15 people died.
      That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later
  revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund
  (IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.
      However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67
  dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price
  increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,
  a practice discouraged by the IMF.
      ""There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of
  meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the
  demands of the IMF and those of the people,"" a Ministry of

  Argentine grain producers adjusted
  their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop
  downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the
  end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.
      They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates
  had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which
  has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.
      However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,
  producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain
  could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.
      Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27
  millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in
  Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in
  Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.
      There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.
      Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce
  rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the
  crops, including soybean.
      However, as the lands began drying later in the week
  harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40
  pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.
      Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested
  material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield
  estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.
      The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at
  2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast
  last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of
  4.1 mln.
      Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9
  to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.
      Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area
  sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will
  begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.
      Production estimates for maize were down from last week at
  9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated
  previously.
      This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln
  tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and
  21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln
  tonnes.
      Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to
  seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.
      Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in
  Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and
  Buenos Aires in mid-April.
      The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3
  to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.
      The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln
  tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,
  and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2
  mln tonne crop.
      The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,
  remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5
  pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for
  1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of
  7.1 mln.
      The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln
  to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln
  sown in 1985/86.
      The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some
  areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some
  experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas
  making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on
  this were not available.
      Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which
  will be sown between May and August or September, has so far
  not been as intense as in previous years.

  Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.
  dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will
  propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record
  profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,
  major company executives predicted.
      This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an
  industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF
  Corp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms
  to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.
      Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the
  Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for
  money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.
      ""I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,"" said
  Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,
  ""There's no major plant capacity being added around the world
  now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving
  the old ones.""
      Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,
  automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of
  paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.
      U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about
  90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike
  product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,
  managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand
  for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up
  by as much as 300 pct, he said.
      Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in
  Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned
  last year and predicted it would have the best year in its
  history.
      In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel
  and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.
  dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. ""I believe the entire
  chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,""
  Oreffice said.
      GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical
  industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.
  Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion
  dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.
      The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical
  industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and
  planning, said Pace's John Dosher.
      Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks
  dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar
  was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost
  U.S. chemical exports.
      Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has
  been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical
  manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers
  in the early 1980s.
      Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers
  have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program
  to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate
  unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of
  friendly and hostile takeover attempts.
      GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire
  Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs
  for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics
  and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> 
  has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer
  businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.
      But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be
  headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on
  the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as
  ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that
  are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.
      ""Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the
  past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity
  chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had
  deteriorated,"" Dosher said. ""But I think they will eventually
  kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche
  market."" Some top chemical executives share the concern.
      ""The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting
  carried away and repeating past mistakes,"" GAF's Heyman
  cautioned. ""The shift from commodity chemicals may be
  ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.""
      Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the
  Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700
  mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.
      Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout
  of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1
  billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants
  along the Texas Gulf Coast.
      The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that
  are the building blocks of specialty products.
      ""This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a
  glamorous, high-margin business,"" Cain said, adding that demand
  is expected to grow by about three pct annually.
      Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said
  chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for
  plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood
  and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical
  business could last as long as four or five years, provided the
  U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.

  &lt;Dominion Textile Inc> considers a
  published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington
  Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the
  company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said.
      ""As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they
  are rumors and we're not commenting on rumors,"" spokesman Michel
  Dufour told Reuters in response to a query.
      ""All the information that has been given out publicly is
  that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an

      Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a

  further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell
  was out of town and unavailable for comment.
      Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln-
  U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln-
  U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition.

      Burlington's stock rose sharply this morning on the report,

  Major cocoa exporters are likely to
  limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world
  prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers
  Alliance (CPA) said.
      The sources said the depressed world market had been one of
  the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the
  11-member CPA which began on Monday.
      They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the
  buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his
  effort to support prices.
      Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed
  operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London
  last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the
  market soon.
      Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa
  surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has
  to buy cocoa under stock rules.
      The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range
  by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise.
      ""The world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting,""
  commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer.
      Another source said that with much of the 1986/87
  (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in
  the near term concerns essentially next year's harvest.
      The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in
  Brazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands.
  This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West
  African producers, where sales are made or authorized by
  commodity marketing boards.
      The CPA includes the world's top three producers, Ivory
  Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.
      The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.

  J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its
  first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its
  previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status
  its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.
      That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest
  payments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20
  mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the
  first three months of 1986.
      Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities
  underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln
  dlrs in the year-earlier period.
      In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading
  losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and
  underwriting of Euromarket securities.
      Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained
  difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering
  heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether
  Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.
      On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan
  losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign
  exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and
  trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.
      Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and
  commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net
  investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.
      Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first
  quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell
  to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.
      If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means
  that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are
  actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9
  mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume
  payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.
      After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for
  credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared
  with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.
      It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after
  charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49
  mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.
      Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were
  583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year
  earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from
  303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to
  personnel costs, Morgan said.

  Storage problems with Brazil's record
  grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln
  tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.
      Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,
  told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this
  year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.
      He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in
  harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage
  problems.
      Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,
  theoretically sufficient for the crop.
      But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly
  distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do
  Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were
  responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.
      The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West
  growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage
  capacity.
      Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and
  maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains
  production but only 20 pct of its storage space.
      In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,
  there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to
  storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for
  storing loose grain, Brito said.
      Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the
  crops.
      The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop
  has been evident from television reports, which have shown
  enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.

  The largest U.S. textile maker focused
  on its own business as its competitors found merger partners,
  but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself
  into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.
      The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose
  4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and
  Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct
  stake.
      A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly
  acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover
  offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for
  Montreal-based Dominion called the report just ""rumors.""
      Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.
      Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of
  the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if
  Burlington actually came into play.
      Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,
  added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it
  was looking for a takeover in the U.S.
      Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills
  and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for
  a U.S. acquisition.
      A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer
  has been negotiating with ""many"" U.S. textile companies, but
  would not say whether Burlington was among them.
      ""There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not
  unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the
  housecleaning they've done,"" said Eileen Gormley of Thomson
  McKinnon.
      Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets
  and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs
  last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its
  operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign
  competition, Gormley said.
      ""They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,""
  said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial
  fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets
  and other fabric to the auto industry.
      ""In the past, they just spent and never realized the return
  on the outlays they did make,"" she said.
      ""You look at their record over the year, and I think
  they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the
  past,"" Gormley said.
       She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up
  from 2.01 dlrs per share.
      Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington
  at its current levels.
      Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends
  selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50
  dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings
  basis.
      Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been
  placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.
      ""After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people
  don't find him very credible anymore,"" said one arbitrager.
      Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing
  managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if
  he doesn't win the target company.
      Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky
  Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying
  Ponderosa Inc.
      The stocks of other textile makers rose along with
  Burlington.
      J.P. Stevens &lt;STN> climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest
  Cannon Inc &lt;FLD>, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and
  Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc &lt;WPM>

  Senior Japanese officials tomorrow
  open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch
  effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide
  variety of Japanese electronic exports.
      Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of
  meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael
  Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.
      The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in
  retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to
  end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and
  to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.
      They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors,
  including television and audio equipment and computers.
      Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little
  likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct
  duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.
      President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27
  after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986
  U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that
  Japan was not honoring the agreement.
      In making the annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed to
  the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to
  provide American industry with free and fair trade.""
      Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's
  semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured
  the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has
  complained about presidential timidity on trade issues.
      Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive
  trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's
  inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last
  year reached 169.8 billion dlrs.
      About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.
      Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to
  adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.
      Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals
  but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.
      He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's
  decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense
  of MITI's power to control Japanese traders.
      ""The United States has excessive expectations.,"" he said. To
  stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by
  excess inventories since 1985 will take some time.""
      He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough
  in trying to sell in the Japanese market.

  Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped
  to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to
  the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite
  continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts
  to extend world penetration.
      Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln
  guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.
      Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's
  leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,
  said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.
      The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,
  Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,
  where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.
      Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker
  foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.
      Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the
  increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El Aguila
  S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly
  in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The
  company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in
  restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.
      Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit
  next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had
  already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.
      Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the
  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer
  into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer
  market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. ""We
  have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important
  point,"" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken
  had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.
      ""The question is not if we want to penetrate the German
  market, but how we are to do it,"" van Schaik said, adding that
  while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a
  taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very
  regionalized.
       Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for
  African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most
  important beer growth markets in the long term.
       He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with
  majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was
  hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.
      Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters
  per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions
  and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total
  1986 sales.
      On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price
  of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists
  have been looking at other possibilities.
      To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on
  the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which
  had sold successfully, Coebergh said.
      Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw
  materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were
  popular in Rwanda . ""This is a possibility, but we could not
  possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,"" Coebergh said.
      Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to
  penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a
  contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.
      But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's
  market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that
  are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western
  money.

  Turkey said today its disputes with
  Greece, including rights on the continental shelf in the Aegean
  Sea, should be solved through negotiations.
      A Foreign Ministry statement said the latest crisis between
  the two NATO members stemmed from the continental shelf dispute
  and an agreement on this issue would effect the security,
  economy and other rights of both countries.
      ""As the issue is basicly political, a solution can only be
  found by bilateral negotiations,"" the statement said. Greece has
  repeatedly said the issue was legal and could be solved at the
  International Court of Justice.
      The two countries approached armed confrontation last month
  after Greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the
  Aegean and Turkey said it would also search for oil.
      A face-off was averted when Turkey confined its research to
  territorrial waters. ""The latest crises created an historic
  opportunity to solve the disputes between the two countries,""
  the Foreign Ministry statement said.

  Medtronic Inc said it sees 15 pct
  growth in sales and earnings for the year ending April 30,
  1988.
      At an analysts meeting here the company said that for the
  year ending April 30, 1987 it will earn about 73 mln dlrs, or
  about 5.15-5.35 dlrs a share on sales of about 500 mln dlrs.
      In the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs,
  or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs.
      Winston Wallin, Medtronic chairman, said the company will
  improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and
  expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line.
      Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per
  share estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will have
  heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988.
      He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its
  businesses and not in its dividends. ""Shareholders are better
  off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends
  or share repurchases,"" he said.
      Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the total
  worldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988,
  from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.
      He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic
  products, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters and
  lasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will
  double that by 1995.
      Wallin said, ""Our objective is to get a hold of new
  products and start building market share if we have to beg,
  borrow or steal to get into new markets.""
      In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued with
  a number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulators
  also have criticized the industry, citing quality problems and
  a needless overprescription of pacemakers.
      ""We have no knowledge of any major problems in our
  pacemakers or leads,"" Wallin said. ""We intend to re-establish
  our company as the quality leader in the industry.""
      Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, said
  the company intends to diversify internally and through
  acquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise,
  such as drug delivery systems.
      Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 does
  not include dilutions from acquisitions. ""We hope to have some
  safety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutions
  from an acquisition.""
      Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivity
  in rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988.
      The company markets Activitrax, the first single chamber
  pacemaker that varies heartrate in response to physical
  activity.
      Siemens AG, a West German company, is also developing a

  Showboat Inc will take a

  third quarter ended March 31, director and assistant to the
  president J. Kell Houssels III told Reuters.
      He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses of
  its recently-opened Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat Hotel, Casino
  and Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarter
  and probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well.
      But Houssels said Showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988
  should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to the

      Showboat earned 1,753,000 dlrs in last year's third

      Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the Atlantic
  City hotel/casino, Showboat has had to start charging interest
  expenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facility
  directly against income rather than capitalizing the interest

  quarter earnings by 7.2 mln dlrs, or nine cts per share, after
  taxes.
      Despite the anticipated reduction to quarterly earnings,
  Security Pacific said it still expects to report first quarter
  earnings higher than the 88 mln dlrs, or 1.11 dlrs per share
  reported for the first quarter of 1986.
      The bank holding company said the action affects 401 mln
  dlrs of loans to Brazil and 73 mln of loans to Ecuador.
      Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs
  of medium- and long-term debt on February 20.
      Ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billion
  dlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks since
  February.
      In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest payments
  for the rest of the year because of an earthquake which halted

  Iraq said today its troops were pushing

  when they launched a new offensive near the southern port of
  Basra early yesterday.
      A High Command communique said Iraqi troops had won a
  significant victory and were continuing to advance.
      Iraq said it had foiled a three-pronged thrust some 10 km
  (six miles) from Basra, but admitted the Iranians had occupied
  ground held by the Mohammed al-Qassem unit, one of three

      (Iran said its troops had killed or wounded more than 4,000
  Iraqis and were stabilising their new positions.)
      The Baghdad communique said Iraqi planes also destroyed oil
  installations at Iran's southwestern Ahvaz field during a raid
  today. It denied an Iranian report that an Iraqi jet was shot

      Iraq also reported a naval battle at the northern tip of

      In its newly released annual report, Union Texas said it

  oil equivalent last year after taking into account the sale of
  27 mln barrels of U.S. reserves.
      Union Texas, the nation's largest independent oil and gas

  by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co and Allied-Signal Inc &lt;ALD>.

      Union Texas said it received an average of 13.35 dlrs per
  barrel for its international oil production and 2.99 dlrs per
  mcf for its foreign natural gas sales. The majority of the
  company's total energy production is in the United Kingdom,

  UAL Inc may have a response this
  afternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its United
  Airlines unit, a UAL spokesman said.
      ""Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and we
  need to get a clarification out,"" the spokesman said, adding
  that there was a ""50-50"" chance a statement would be released
  today.
      The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for
  2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.
      Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for several
  weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer
  Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also
  held discussions with its chairman.
      The developer indicated in those talks that he took the
  position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.
      Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying
  UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2
  mln shares.
      ""United has got to consider this proposal. I think the
  pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,
  but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL
  management,"" said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.
      Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack
  when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz
  rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a
  strategy to become a travel service company.
      The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union
  concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention
  on its airline.
      UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its
  new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.
      But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has
  been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100
  dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as
  widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe
  the stock is in play.
      Market sources have said that although Trump attracted
  attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a
  catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps
  throwing the company into the hands of another buyer.
      ""The first domino is you have an investor with a
  considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type
  of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,""
  said Pettee.
      ""What's interesting is the values are there. There's
  something for everybody,"" he said.

  The U.S. meat and poultry inspection

      ""The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has
  been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the

  chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow

      FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5

  salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time

  Chrysler Corp and Regie Natiionale des
  Usines Renault said they agreed to extend by up to two weeks
  the period for reaching definitive agreement on Chrysler's
  proposed 1.5 billion dlr takeover of American Motors Corp.
      The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault on
  March nine set April nine as the target date for completing
  negotiations.
      However, the letter also allowed room for an extension of
  that date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached.
      The two companies said they ""now plan to complete work by
  April 23.""
      Chrysler and Renault said, ""Given the complex nature of the
  deal, the need for additional time was to be expected.""
      The March letter of intent between the two companies says
  that Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date
  ""in the event that prior to April 9, 1987, Chrysler discovers
  an unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence'
  investigation of the company,"" referring to American Motors.
      A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem
  had cropped up in the talks. She stuck by the company's
  statement that more time was needed because the talks are
  complex. ""That is our definition of the delay,"" she said.
      Under the previous agreement between Chrysler and Renault,
  their letter of intent would be terminated on April nine or
  when an agreement was reached. But the letter could be amendend
  by a written agreement by both companies.
      The Chrysler spokeswoman said, ""We are still working toward
  a definitive agreement."" Said another Chrysler official who is
  not part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were in
  trouble: ""There are no glitches.""
      Analysts also downplayed the significance of the delay. ""I
  can't visualize where they wouldn't want it to be done,"" said
  Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette analyst Richard Henderson.

      General Electric also attibuted continued strong
  performances in plastics, major appliances and the Employers
  Reinsurance Corp for its strong quarter.
      GE recorded net earnings for the first quarter 1987 of 624

  1.18 dlrs per share for the same quarter a year ago.
      General Electric chairman John Welch Jr reiterated the
  company's outlook for 1987 in which it expects double-digit GE
  earnings growth for the year. He said the first quarter results
  are in line with those expectations.
      General Electric cited the strong results in TV network and

  not part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason for
  its strong earnings.
      It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was
  much higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipments
  than the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike.
      Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's first
  quarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion of
  RCA's aerospace and defense business, the company said.
      In addition, consumer products revenues were up from last
  year, mainly because of including sales of RCA video products.
      General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln
  dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were
  charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987. It
  added that there was a one-time gain of 281 mlns dlrs after
  taxes from an inventory accounting change.
      And technical products revenues and operating profit were
  ahead of last year, led by a strong increases in medical

  Bennett Johnston, also repeals mandatory incremental pricing of
  natural gas which was designed to protect residential consumers
  from major price increases by forcing some industrial users to
  pay higher than market prices.
      ""This legislation will open up new natural gas markets,"" the
  Lousiana Democrat said.
      The gas restrictions were enacted in 1978 in response to a
  shortage of natural gas and predictions of higher prices.
      ""Now both oil and gas prices are severely depressed,""
  Johnston said.
      In a compromise with coal producers, the bill requires new
  baseload electric powerplants be designed to accomodate
  modifications necessary to burning coal or another alternate
  fuel.

  Williams Cos said it expected oil and
  fertilizer transportation volumes to be flat in 1987 but said
  operating profits from the pipeline unit should improve from
  49.4 mln dlrs earned last year when a seven mln dlr special
  charge was incurred.
      Williams Pipeline Co took the charge against earnings in
  1986 for the removal of more than 500 miles of old pipeline
  from service and for casualty losses. Companywide, Williams had
  a net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billion
  dlrs, a decline from profits of 32 mln dlrs on sales of 2.46
  billion in 1985.
      In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest Pipeline
  Corp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that are
  among the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07
  dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gas
  reserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feet
  in 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year.
      The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which has
  less take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, should
  show improvement in its 1987 operating results because of
  changes tariff and federal tax rates.
      The company's gas marketing business is expected to have
  somewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in its
  operating region, the annual report said. The gas marketing
  unit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year.
      Williams also said it expected a substantial decline in its
  debt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mln
  dlrs received in cash from the sale of Agrico Chemical Co and
  proceeds from the sale and leaseback of Williams
  Telecommunications Co. The telecommunications business, a
  2,000-mile fiber optic system for long distance use, will not
  be profitable until late 1988, Williams said.

  Financial analysts say they are
  pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal
  budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help
  improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.
      The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow
  to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming
  fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.
      Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan
  that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next
  year.
          ""In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is
  infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little
  impact on the economy and the trade deficit,"" said Stanley
  Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.
      ""At best, it will have a small positive effect,"" Collander
  said in an interview.
      Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly
  told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way
  to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease
  some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.
      The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade
  imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker
  has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught
  with danger.
      Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as
  imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign
  capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.
      In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other
  major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of
  the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates
  should be stabilized at around current levels.
      As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to
  take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States
  agreed to cut its budget deficit.
      The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a
  way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is
  to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.
      ""If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else
  you do is going to be counterproductive,"" Volcker said in recent
  testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
      Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the
  government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit
  supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or
  to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United
  States.
      Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the
  current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.
      Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed
  that any deficit reduction was better than none.
      But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were 
  not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it
  needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar
  from plunging further in world exchange markets.
      ""There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if
  your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the
  Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer
  is, it's not enough,"" Silvia told Reuters.
      The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's
  most vexing and persistent problems.
      The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet
  little indication that this year's figure will be any lower,
  though administration officials have predicted it will drop by
  about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.
      In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep
  worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the
  federal budget.
      On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not
  attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for
  the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced
  budget law.
      While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for
  next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget
  Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall
  short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.
      ""For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the
  most you're going to get"" out of Congress at the present time,
  said Touche Ross's Collander. ""To do something more than that
  would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.""
      Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up
  short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.
      ""To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable
  reduction level,"" he explained. ""Anything less than that will now
  look like a failure to Wall Street.""
      The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would
  lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year
  beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting
  defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their
  anticipated spending levels for next year.
      The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of
  nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new 
  taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.

       ""They were very frustrated with their inability to get

  Prudential-Bache securities. ""There's going to be more to come

  tobacco is still a significant part of earnings. Their position

  type of acquisition they envisioned.

  Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and
  Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force
  to be reckoned with, political analysts said.
      MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.
  And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of
  a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,
  they said.
      ""The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of
  a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,""
  said one diplomatic source.
      ""They are a potent political force,"" the diplomatic source
  said.
      But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not
  always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts
  said.
      ""The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not
  so internationalized,"" said Waseda University professor Mitsuru
  Uchida. ""Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world
  community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to
  face the situation.""
      Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with
  London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep
  a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in
  Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business.
      The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival
  groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one
  competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now
  monopolizes the business.
      It has also opposed a major management role in the planned
  merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on
  the grounds that no such international precedent exists.
      The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has
  threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger
  plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open
  its telecommunications market.
      Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it
  says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car
  telephone and satellite communications market.
      Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the
  sector it regulates.
      ""What has been happening is an important shift in the
  economy which makes the ministry a very important place,"" said
  James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory
  Service Inc.
      A decision to open the telecommunications industry to
  competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted
  rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.
      ""With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto
  legal framework,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell
  Whitten.
      Close links with the powerful political faction of the
  ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime
  Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the
  analysts said.
      ""Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka
  faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance
  of MPT,"" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of
  the influential political group, he added.
      The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to
  the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the
  Postal Savings System, analysts said.
      MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate
  interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial
  liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal
  Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than
  banks, they said.
      Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's
  obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized
  the ministry as feudal.
      Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting
  competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its
  wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest
  price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.
      But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of
  its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world
  including Britain, several analysts said.
      ""The United States is really the odd man out,"" Abegglen said.
  ""For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order
  in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable
  view,"" he said.

  Following is the text of a statement
  by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
  Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting
  yesterday.
      1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of
  seven major industrial countries met today.
      They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of
  their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened
  economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of
  their heads of state or government.
      The managing director of the International Monetary Fund
  also participated in the meeting.
      2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to
  the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,
  and noted the progress achieved in implementing the
  undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.
      They agreed, however, that further actions will be
  essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
  global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.
      In this connection they welcomed the proposals just
  announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan
  for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's
  economy through early implementation of a large supplementary
  budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as
  unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
      The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further
  open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.
      3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that
  around current levels their currencies are within ranges
  broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic
  policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.
      In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation
  of the Louvre Agreement.
      They concluded that present and prospective progress in
  implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this
  statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to
  foster the stability of exchange rates.

  The European Community launched an

  an intensification of world trade strains.
      Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington
  for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it
  imports into the U.S.
      The EC Executive Commission said today the European
  Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that
  Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable
  programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.
      Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM
  market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been
  forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in

  Dutch insurer AEGON NV &lt;AEGN.AS>
  reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln
  guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits
  for 1987.
      Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion
  guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its
  revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a
  change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would
  have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.
      Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly
  due to its life insurance business.
      Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose
  despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and
  higher personal risks.
      Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage
  insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.
      In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and
  life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change
  in accounting for U.S. Annuities.
      AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal
  investment influences that it should be accounted differently
  from the more traditional insurances.
      This change in accounting practice and another change to
  account for profits made on fixed interest investments,
  resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln
  guilders.
      AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits
  were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial
  costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The
  Hague.
      In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged
  in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial
  costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.
      Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in
  May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these
  costs and made only a small contribution to the group's
  profits.
      AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill
  for Monumental Corp.
      AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December
  1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.

  Following is the text of a statement
  by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
  Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting
  yesterday.
      1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of
  seven major industrial countries met today.
      They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of
  their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened
  economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of
  their heads of state or government.
      The managing director of the International Monetary Fund
  also participated in the meeting.
      2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to
  the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,
  and noted the progress achieved in implementing the
  undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.
      They agreed, however, that further actions will be
  essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
  global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.
      In this connection they welcomed the proposals just
  announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan
  for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's
  economy through early implementation of a large supplementary
  budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as
  unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
      The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further
  open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.
      3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that
  around current levels their currencies are within ranges
  broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic
  policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.
      In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation
  of the Louvre Agreement.
      They concluded that present and prospective progress in
  implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this
  statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to
  foster the stability of exchange rates.

  The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation
  (FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to
  fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.
      FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world
  grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in
  1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet
  Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.
      World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to
  rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the
  impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly
  distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.
      ""Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many
  developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially
  on the outcome of this year's harvests,"" FAO said.
      FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at
  a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last
  season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986
  harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.
      FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised
  upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of
  substantial buying by China and the Soviet Union.

      Physio Technology said the resignation of Chairman James C.
  Lane can constitute non-compliance with its Series A
  convertible subordinated debentures due 1996 and a default
  under its agreement with the Merchants Bank of Kansas City.
      It explained a declaration of non-compliance under the
  debentures would create a a default under the loan agreements
  requiring immediate payment of 1.8 mln dlrs of debentures and
  about 450,000 dlrs outstanding under the bank credit line.
      The company said the debenture holders intend to waive the

  The global economy is expected to
  weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious
  poverty outlook, economic analysts said.
      For finance ministers and central bankers attending this
  week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund
  and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an
  additional concern.
      The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct
  this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.
      In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a
  measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to
  2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.
      For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,
  another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0
  pct from 3.5 pct last year.
      The new figures are considered a major disappointment to
  the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the
  industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil
  prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope
  with growing mounds of debt.
      IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed
  the industrial country economies would move up to an annual
  growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.
      Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some
  time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into
  an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.
      Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier
  states for markets for their products as well as financial
  assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' 
  economies poses fundamental worries.
      Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have
  only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,
  including the key one of exports.
      The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,
  has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it
  too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only
  2.3 pct, according to the IMF.
      For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the
  United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to
  ignite their economies but with little apparent success.
      The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and
  the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade
  deficit.
      Reagan administration officials have been saying that the
  impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much
  slower than expected.
      The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that ""it has
  to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to
  work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years
  to get a resonably complete effect.""
      The report added, however, ""the adjustments may take even
  more time on this occasion.""

"test/15552";"International_Trade";"3";"SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES
  The head of Spain's employers'
  federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried
  about the government's monetary policies because high real
  interest rates were hampering investment.
      He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this
  year were not endangering the government's five pct inflation
  target. The government's perceived need to control inflation by
  keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.
      High real interest rates were attracting an influx of
  speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the
  government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.
      Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,
  liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17
  pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a
  target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.
      To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money
  rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from
  11.8 at end-1986.
      Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to
  hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,
  with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new
  wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.
      These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish
  workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.
      He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the
  state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five
  pct wage ceiling.
      Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in
  Spain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first
  two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct
  increase over the corresponding period last year.
      However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the
  peseta to correct the imbalance.

  India's national foodgrain target has
  been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchanged
  from the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in its
  annual report for 1986/87.
      Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87
  due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological
  sub-divisions of the country.
      The report gave the targets for various crops with
  estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,
  in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains
  including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).
      Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was
  possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying
  growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.
      The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with
  greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in
  fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding
  total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84
  respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4
  mln.
     India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes
  of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year
  development plan ending March 31, 1990.
      Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the
  1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap
  of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three
  years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more
  than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with
  good weather, the report said.
      ""The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water
  (irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of
  improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm
  materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be
  vigrously pursued,"" it said.

  Losses for Volkswagen AG
  &lt;VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will
  not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW
  spokesman said.
      The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it
  would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on
  1986 business, despite the provision.
      One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency
  dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from
  the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but
  the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an ""upper limit.""
      VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board
  meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in
  detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign
  currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing
  company.
      VW has said computer programs were erased and documents
  were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes
  transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign
  currency losses were not completed.
      VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was
  arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having
  evaded justice.
      Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985
  profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and
  parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend
  an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has
  also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,
  which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held
  dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.
      VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5
  billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment
  on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,
  since the new capital was in preference shares.
      The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in
  order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At
  the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly
  less than three billion marks.

  National Distillers and Chemical Corp
  expects to realize a second quarter after-tax gain of four dlrs
  per share from the 545 mln dlr sale of its spirits business to
  American Brands Inc &lt;AMB>.
      National Distillers' stock rose 1-1/8 to 65-1/2, after an
  opening delay on the New York Stock exchange for an imbalance
  of orders.
      ""I think the sales price was higher than most people
  expected,"" said John Henry of E.F. Hutton Group.
      A company spokeswoman said the four dlr per share gain will
  be included in second quarter net, which compares with 31 cts
  per share last year, including the spirits and wine business
      ""They netted over 700 mln dlrs for spirits and wine. That
  will ease their interest cost burden,"" said Henry.
      National Distillers sold its wine business last month to
  Grand Metropolitan PLC's Heublein Inc for 128 mln dlrs.
      Henry said he had anticipated National Distillers would net
  only 600 mln dlrs at the most from the sale of the two liquor
  businesses.
      Henry said the company recovered from the sales the cost of
  buying Enron Chemicals in the fourth quarter last year.
  National Distillers paid 570 mln dlrs cash for Enron and
  assumed 34 mln dlrs in debt. National Distillers said at the
  time it bought Enron it would sell the spirits and wine
  businesses, moving more into the chemical area.
      For 1986, two thirds of income were from chemicals and
  propane. National Distillers earned, excluding the liquor
  businesses, 2.21 dlrs per share for 1986. Income from
  discontinued operations, including the liquor businesses, was
  67 cts per share.

  Based on field travel in the
  Brazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be about
  average or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.
      The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about
  20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.
      It said generally favorable weather from early December
  through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.
      However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days
  followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second
  week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans
  which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the
  report said.
      The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create
  serious storage problems, the report said.
      Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by
  more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are
  expected to be above average, it said.
      Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop
  crop has been harvested.
      During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain
  elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the
  report said.
      New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana
  accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons
  for the decline are expected reduced government support price
  and good summer crop harvests.

  Southmark Corp said it will issue its

      Each right entitles the holder to buy one share of

      Southmark said the offer's record date is May 1, with an

      Holders of fewer than 455 Southmark shares who would
  receive rights to acquire fewer than 100 American Realty shares

  U.S. retailers' lackluster March sales
  were due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect a
  recovery in April.
      ""Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, but
  underlying business is better than the numbers indicate,"" said
  Bear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.
       Analysts generally average the sales results of March and
  April to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. This
  year, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three
  weeks later than last year.
      Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said
  sales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a
  seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted
  5.7 pct last year.
      ""The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate
  that the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear
  to be because liquidity and employment are rising,"" said
  analyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.
      Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in
  according to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected
  to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.
       In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket
  items were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many
  analysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the
  holiday nears.
      ""Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a
  continuing strength in the housing market,"" said Edward
  Brennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported an
  overall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women's
  sportswear were also excellent.
      ""Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even
  a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment
  due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,""
  said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner. 
      J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH> were
  among the weaker performers with comparable stores sales
  declining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store and
  catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson's
  overall sales rose 4.8 pct.
      Penney chairman William Howell said, ""Sales continued
  strong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from
  very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed
  southwest.""
      ""Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity
  wear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,
  but are currently hurting sales,"" said Greenstein of Bear
  Stearns.
      Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for
  the decline. Edelman of Drexel said that ""Hudson had a tougher
  comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986.""
      Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower
  than last year.
      ""Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are
  being kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales
  are coming through anyway,"" said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.
      Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  
  be better than he had originally expected in the beginning of
  the year.
      Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle of
  May.

  Zimbabwe's beef exports to the European
  Community (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this
  year, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth
  disease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.
      The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the
  EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC
  veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.
      The outbreak in the country's main ranching province has
  already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to
  bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairy
  industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export
  revenue.
      ""The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally
  when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of
  beef exports,"" one industry source said yesterday.
       Commenting on EC policy, he explained, ""Depending on the
  seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then
  decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting
  beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension
  on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are
  still awaiting their decision,"" he added, asking not to be
  identified.
      Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of
  high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had
  spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and
  upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.
      Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be
  forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low
  prices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef sales
  could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.

  The House Armed Services Committee
  has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled
  materials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.
      The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and
  quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.
      The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill
  which will be voted on in the House next month.
      The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee
  yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage
  sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a
  staff member of the committee told Reuters.
      ""They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being
  managed properly,"" said the staffer. ""Management of the stockpile
  over the last 10 years has been atrocious.""
      Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a
  White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      The staffer said under the measures passed by the committee
  the Secretary of Defense would have more influence over
  decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.
      The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs
  worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The
  stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.
      He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage
  the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.
      These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget
  and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.
      The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile
  management was counter-productive, he said.

  Canada's trade picture has brightened
  considerably, underscoring economists' predictions the sector
  would post a long awaited recovery this year.
      The federal government reported today that the monthly
  surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February,
  double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than
  February 1986's 189 mln dlr tally.
      ""Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend,"" said Richardson
  Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.
      Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the
  next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the
  year.
      ""We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the
  year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is
  indicative of that,"" commented economist James Donegan at the
  Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.
      Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23
  pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion
  dls in the month.
      ""Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of
  exports up by 5.9 pct in February,"" the agency said in its
  monthly report.
      Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85
  billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion
  dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.
      Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end
  up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal
  10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion
  dlrs.
      Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched
  off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85
  U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after
  closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.
      The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early
  afternoon trading.
      Economists have been banking on an improved trade
  performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish
  Canadian economy.
      Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched
  off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85
  U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after

      The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early
  afternoon trading.
      Economists have been banking on an improved trade
  performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish
  Canadian economy.
      They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at
  a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays
  this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into
  the country.
      Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United
  States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be
  strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer
  spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.
      ""We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export
  performance is income growth in the U.S.,"" said Midland's
  Donegan.
      But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist
  Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and
  said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's
  trade upturn.
      Jestin said, ""Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing
  signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate
  that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is
  probably transitory.""

  The House Armed Services Committee
  has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled
  materials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.
      The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and
  quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.
      The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill
  which will be voted on in the House next month.
      The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee
  yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage
  sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a
  staff member of the committee told Reuters.
      ""They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being
  managed properly,"" said the staffer. ""Management of the stockpile
  over the last 10 years has been atrocious.""
      Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a
  White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      The staffer said that under the measures passed by the
  committee the Secretary of Defense would have more influence
  over decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.
      The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs
  worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The
  stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.
      He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage
  the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.
      These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget
  and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.
      The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile
  management was counter-productive, he said.

  The U.S. Agriculture Department
  increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet
  Union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.
      In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the
  USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because
  Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last
  month.
      USDA said the increased purchasing is ""somewhat surprising""
  because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.
      All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,
  USDA said.
      Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12
  mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes
  miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.
      USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered
  through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.
      The severe winter ""is believed to have resulted in above
  average winter-kill,"" USDA said.
      Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses
  maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying
  grain recently.
      USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes
  grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat
  and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.

      Shamrock Holdings of California Inc, a Disney family

      The offer was for 45 dlrs in cash, securities with a face

  would pay out as much as 70 dlrs over a 20-year period for each

      Shamrock said it had asked for certain information about
  Holly Sugar's financial condition but had been turned down. It
  said its offer was therefore subject to further discussions.
      ""Once we have had an opportunity to complete our due
  diligence evaluation of the company, including inspections of
  certain facilities and meetings with key management personnel,
  we would be prepared to negotiate all aspects of our proposal,
  including price,"" it said in its April 8 letter.

  The United States' dependency on
  foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,
  according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry
  Research Associates.
      Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference
  here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much
  as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high
  level of 47 pct in 1977.
      ""The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is
  inevitable,"" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil
  imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.
      Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for
  33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to
  40 pct by 1990.
      ""However, the rate of this growth can be affected
  positively or negatively through government action or
  inaction,"" Lichtblau said.
      He said that one of the government's negative actions is
  the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a
  disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash
  flow for oil exploration.
      Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor
  price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.
      ""An international floor price adopted by all or most
  industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective
  measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if
  we imposed it alone,"" Lichtblau said.
      Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic
  fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen
  U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.
      A potential for alternative supplies could limit the
  willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.
      Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer
  tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic
  Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans
  for alternative energy.

  Agriculture Department said.
      In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, the
  department said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largest
  buyers.
      Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September
  1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.
      Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season and
  net reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were
  four-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and the

      Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination with

      Other significant purchasers for the current year were
  Mexico and Honduras, it said.
      Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below the
  prior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.
      Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the major
  purchasers, the department said.
      Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell
  31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-week
  average. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, the
  Netherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset by
  reductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.
      Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400
  tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700
  tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, the
  Department said.
      Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200
  bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88
  season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's level
  but nine pct below the four-week average.
      Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followed
  by Zaire, Italy, and Spain, the department said.
  The primary buyers for the 1987/88 season were South Korea,
  Spain, Japan and Taiwan, the department said.

  Crude oil netback values in complex
  refineries rose sharply in Europe and firmed in the U.S. last
  Friday from the previous week but fell sharply in Singapore,
  according to calculations by Reuters Pipeline.
      The firmer tone to refining margins in Europe and the U.S.
  relected higher prices for petroleum products, particularly
  gasoline, and support from crude oil prices.
      Netback values for crude oil refined in Northern Europe
  rose substantially following strong gains in gasoline prices
  there. Brent is valued at 19.45 dlrs, up 56 cts a barrel or
  three pct from the previous week.
      In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by 14 cts to
  19.33 dlrs for West Texas Intermediate, up about 0.7 pct.
      Sour grades in the U.S. Gulf showed an increase of 33 cts a
  barrel for Alaska North Slope, up 1.7 pct.
      But netbacks for crude oil refined in Singapore fell
  sharply, down 15 cts to as much as 68 cts a barrel as ample
  distillate supplies weighed on petroleum product prices.
      Attaka in Singapore is valued at 18.55 dlrs, a decline of
  68 cts a barrel or 3.5 pct from the previous week.
      For refineries in the Mediterranean, netback values were
  mostly lower, with declines of seven to 14 cts. The value of
  Kuwait crude fell 14 cts to 18.37 dlrs, while Iranian Light
  fell 11 cts to 19.14 dlrs.
      On the U.S. West Coast, netback values for ANS CIF L.A.

  Commodities from gold to grains to
  cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses
  in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of
  inflation and economic instability.
      Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New
  York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a
  troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.
      A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that
  inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations
  to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve
  Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,
  Harris Upham and Co., in New York.
      The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from
  the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their
  commitment to support its value, and despite reports of
  intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.
      Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known
  as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term
  direction of the currency markets.
      ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""If
  they do, it's not evident.""
      ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market
  take values to where they should be.
      ""One way or another, we will force our major trading
  partners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correct
  the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.
      ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long
  time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's
  going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's
  happening,"" he said.
      The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities
  cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.
      At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds
  saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning
  to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty
  McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of
  Dominick and Dominick.
      The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout
  the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton
  posted broad gains.
      Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the
  grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome
  supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate
  export demand.
      After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department
  raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by
  two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.
      Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the
  Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately
  higher.
      Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said
  hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at
  this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field
  work to market animals.

  A sugar mill which was this
  nation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday,
  saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from
  Miami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic.
      The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO)
  will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to
  40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital,
  the company said.
      ""Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO
  regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane
  after April 10,"" the mill warned planters earlier this week.
      Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen
  months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking
  oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer
  prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing
  hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work.
      At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to
  receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a
  warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound
  (45-kg) bags of sugar.
      ""We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar.
  We have no money left to continue operations,"" Rigaud said.
      He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an
  additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.
      Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier
  two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar.
      He said the government then began importing refined sugar
  at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and
  the provisional military-civilian government that replaced
  Duvalier last year continued the policy.
      ""But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete
  with smuggled Dominican refined sugar,"" Rigaud said.
      HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above
  the usual minimum wage of three dlrs.
      It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian
  supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at a
  minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people.
      Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. ""We're dead,
  and it's the government that's causing us to die,"" declared
  Lucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents.

  Taiwan announced plans for another round
  of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade
  talks with Washington which officials described as a move to
  help balance trade with the United States.
      Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's
  Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of
  products included 60 items asked by Washington.
      ""The move is part of our government efforts to encourage
  imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United
  States,"" he said.
      He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet
  that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,
  apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut
  by between five and 50 pct.
      The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday
  and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting
  on April 20, he added.
      Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700
  foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its
  growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's
  largest trading partner.
      Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and
  pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade
  deficit with Taipei.
      Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6
  billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It
  widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78
  billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.
      Today's announcement came before a departure later today of
  a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of
  trade talks with U.S. Officials.
      The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last
  night he was leaving with ""a heavy heart,"" meaning that he would
  face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist
  sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus
  with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.
      Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.
  Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,
  purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,
  import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.
      ""I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from
  our talks with the U.S.,"" he said without elaborating.

  A British minister said he had given the
  Japanese government a clear warning of sanctions against
  Japanese companies if Tokyo did not allow more access to its
  internal markets ""and it was clearly understood.""
      Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said on his
  return from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese were
  beginning to appreciate the need to be ""fair and open"" about
  access to their own markets.
      At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition
  charges that his trip had been a failure because he had
  returned empty-handed.
      ""I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clear
  message to the Japanese government, and I delivered it very
  clearly, and it has been clearly understood.""
      Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the
  govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions
  against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in
  Britain.
      ""It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing
  operating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries
  from carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing
  them to carry out other kinds.""
      ""I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made it
  clear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall use
  them.""
      He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became
  involved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gained
  more than anyone else from an open trading relationship.
      ""I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this
  relationship is to continue, it is very important for them to
  be fair and open about access to their own markets.""
      On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc
  &lt;CAWL.L>, which is trying to win a significant share of
  telecommunications contracts in Japan, Howard said he had told
  the Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case.
      He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and
  Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday,
  he said.
      Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
  said Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan,
  but would have to coordinate action with its European Community
  partners.
      Community sources said after a meeting of trade officials
  yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a
  range of Japanese goods to prevent diversion from United States
  markets if Washington imposes trade sanctions against Tokyo as
  it has threatened.

  Uganda's Coffee Marketing Board (CMB)
  has stopped offering coffee on the international market because
  it is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.
      The board suspended offerings last week but because of its
  urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it
  could sustain, the sources added.
      Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been
  waiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has had
  trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the
  Kenyan port of Mombasa.
      Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by
  holding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings from
  coffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said.
      The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money
  and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty
  for such delays, it added.
      Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that
  commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings
  -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the
  current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100
  billion.
      The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of
  annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment.
      The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's export
  earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is
  likely to more than offset an expected increase in production.
      CMB officials have forecast that because the government has
  restored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda will
  produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending
  September 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.

  A prolonged dry spell has damaged
  111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces
  in the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officials
  said.
      They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce
  estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of
  rainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing
  conditions continued until next month.
      Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the
  losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in
  other, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry
  spell.
      Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),
  representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8
  mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.
      About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at
  170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.
      Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been
  hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total
  thus the damage is considered negligible.
      In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by
  production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified
  into the cash crop from sugar two years ago.
       The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut production
  in the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to
  320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were no
  reports of actual damage.

  Hungary has announced sharp price
  increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of
  its efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit.
      The official MTI news agency said the government decided
  consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state
  spending. From today the price of meat will rise by an average
  18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said.
      MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive,
  with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also
  announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including
  higher pensions and family allowances.
      Statistics indicate the budget deficit tripled in 1986 to
  47 billion forints. Central banker Janos Fekete has said the
  Finance Ministry is trying to cut the 1987 shortfall to between
  30 and 35 billion from a planned 43.8 billion.
      A major tax reform, including the introduction of a
  Western-style valued added tax, is planned for January 1988 in
  an effort to cure problems in state spending.
      But diplomats said the latest announcement shows the

  deficit under control.
      The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated
  economy, and could help dampen Hungarians' appetite for
  imported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive
  hard currency, the diplomats said.
      The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect
  the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in
  other East Bloc states, notably Poland.

  The government must announce harsh cuts
  in spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to give
  an adequate response to Australia's economic problems, the ANZ
  Banking Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S> said.
      Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against the
  backdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14
  billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthly
  Business Indicators publication.
      ""For the past two years, the government has struggled with
  an economic reality that demands measures beyond those which it
  sees as politically practicable,"" it said.
      The political climate meant there would be a continued
  over-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate and
  maintain confidence in economic management, ANZ said.
      ""The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revival
  of business investment will be further postponed,"" it said.
      The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted by
  export and import-replacement industries which had created a
  false suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance of
  payments crisis were past. ""Unfortunately, successful adjustment
  to Australia's deep-seated economic problems remains a
  long-term process,"" it said.
      In its economic forecasts, ANZ said it expected moderate
  overall economic growth with gross domestic product (GDP)
  rising 2.7 pct this year and 2.4 pct in 1988.
      The current account deficit would narrow to five pct of GDP
  this year and 4.3 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would grow
  strongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 97.2 billion at
  end-1987 and 110.3 billion a year later.
      Inflation would fall to 8.5 pct in 1987 and 7.5 pct in 1988

  Texaco Inc &lt;TX> said its decision to
  file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
  code will not affect the majority of its businesses.
      It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its
  32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property,
  plant and equipment, were free of the action.
      Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operating
  subsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, are
  affected, it said.
      But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents
  per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments
  on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.
      Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were
  demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a
  result of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.
      Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond
  of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985
  judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's
  1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp &lt;GTY>. The bond almost
  matches the damages awarded against Texaco.
      Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could begin
  to attach its assets to secure the judgment.
      Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut
  Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to
  the Texas courts.
      Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all
  Texaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of
  the Pennzoil lawsuit.
      ""Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond
  issue and the larger dispute failed,"" James Kinnear, Texaco's
  president and chief executive officer, told reporters.
      Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers on
  Friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until
  the end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.
      Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash
  bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of
  earnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not
  sell any assets, Kinnear said.
      Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of
  credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under
  11.1 billion dlrs, he added.
      Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the
  company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on
  Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for
  bankruptcy.
      He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a
  confidentiality agreement between the two companies. ""Texaco
  told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go
  to bankruptcy court,"" Jamail said.
      Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would
  prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were
  ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.

  National Bank economic data for 1986
  shows that Yugoslavia's trade deficit grew, the inflation rate
  rose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded and

      The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pct
  higher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first three
  months of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hard
  currency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs.
      Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures in
  dinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollars
  based on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar.
      Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with the
  convertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344
  mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to a
  deterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currency
  area rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.
      Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 while
  industrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank's data
  showed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct.
      Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986.
      Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wages
  were too high given the level of productivity.
      Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of the
  last quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity.
      Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 money
  supply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9

  A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome
  Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>
  may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door
  for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
      Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
  of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
  debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
  substantial payments to creditors will expire.
      Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders
  that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.
      Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
  public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
  negotiations.
      TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt
  restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
  Ltd said from Toronto.
      Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow
  creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
  to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
  cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
      ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
  even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
  Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""
  said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
  Calgary.
      TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome
  was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
  refinancing packages, Gobert said.
      The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome
  since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
  to agree to a restructuring, he added.
      ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
  any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said.
      Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
  TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
  the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other
  possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to
  us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
  reluctant to come forward,"" he said.
      Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal
  offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
  confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
      Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
  with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other
  unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and
  financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
  TransCanada's.
      Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price
  for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
      However, he said not enough financial details are known
  about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
  TransCanada's proposed offer.

  Member states of the European
  Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which
  they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open
  its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.
      Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC
  countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the
  willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese
  government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.
      However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as
  EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.
      Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to
  an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could
  raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.
  Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.
      The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations
  entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed
  to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of
  the U.S.
      The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's
  trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in
  March, up from 1.94 billion in February.
      In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion
  dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one
  pct to 12.43 billion dlrs.
      In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has
  decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine.
      Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen
  Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application
  of French quality standards -- something EC states say often
  happens to their own exports entering Japan.
      Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese
  banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,
  because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in
  competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract.
      However, British officials in London have said that the
  government may have gone too far in implying that it would take
  immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.
      By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful
  economy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring
  to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own
  industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan.
      The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent
  years, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open
  its market with specific demands for moves in key areas.
      At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end
  allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and
  spirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts
  for the building of a new international airport, and to
  simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.
      EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but
  often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff
  barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.
      They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the
  EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.
      One of the problems Britain could face if it were to
  withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers
  would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,
  they point out.

  Australia could lose valuable wheat
  markets through lack of availability if plantings for the
  coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian
  Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.
      ""If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove
  true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its
  valuable markets,"" he said in a statement.
      Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB
  spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that
  farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut
  back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.
      However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be
  cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were
  facing enormous financial pressures.
      He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln
  hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about
  16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting
  intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.
      If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in
  plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed
  with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling
  wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.
      ""Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat
  understand a decrease in production due to drought but they
  will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to
  decrease production,"" Condon said.
      ""If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export
  income earner, governments and government authorities will need
  to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing
  viability of the wheat industry,"" he added.
      Australia's leading wheat markets include China, Egypt,
  Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan.

  A major animal feed producer, Cehave
  NV Veghel (CHV), has begun legal proceedings against the
  application of the European Community grain co-responsibility
  levy, with the full backing of the Dutch animal grain and feed
  trade association, Het Comite, association chief executive
  Peter Pex told Reuters.
      Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and the
  court said it would give its verdict within six weeks. ""However,
  that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court to
  refer questions on the interpretation and application of the
  levy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg,"" Pex added.
      Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not take
  account of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean a
  compounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy in
  its own national currency than it received down the chain from
  the original producer of the grain.
      ""We would like the Business Administration Court in the
  Hague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whether
  the Dutch Grain Commodity Board, the levy collection agency,
  has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but also
  whether the regulations themselves may contravene European law,""
  Pex said.
      ""It is only with great regret that we have taken this route,
  but we have had no political help, and therefore have no option
  even though it could take years,"" Pex added.
      Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against the
  grain levy because the bill the company received from the
  commodity board included grain from a wide variety of origins
  and was therefore considered to be the best general basis for a
  legal challenge to the levy, Pex noted.
      Het Comite's actions will run in tandem with questions on
  the levy already posed to the Luxembourg Court in a case
  brought by the Association of European Animal Feed
  Manufacturers, FEFAC.

  The five leading West German economic
  research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the
  domestic economy will expand this year but revised down
  forecasts contained in a report published six months ago.
      The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essen
  predicted in the institutes' joint spring report that gross
  national product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, compared
  with 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecast
  three pct 1987 growth in October last year.
      Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin
  and Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.
      The joint report said that the estimates of economic
  development made by the DIW and Ifo were ""markedly less
  favourable"" than those of the other three.
      The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a
  slow start to the year. ""In the second half of 1987 there will,
  however, only be a weak upward movement,"" they said.
      The two institutes said external economic factors which
  were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would
  dominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw
  exports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no
  marked improvement in the course of the year.
      The other three institutes, however, wrote: ""The decline in
  demand and production (seen) in the winter months does not
  indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.""
      They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate
  uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.
  But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled
  but only put off. ""It can be presumed that the braking actions
  (on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.""
      They added: ""The domestic prerequisites for a continuation
  of the economic uptrend are still favourable.""
      These three institutes said diminishing external burdens
  combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in
  demand and production could be expected by the spring.
      However, this projection was clouded by risks including the
  further development of the mark against the dollar.
      Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that
  while exports would continue to be the weak point of the
  economy in 1987, ""there is good reason to believe that exports
  will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during
  the course of the year."" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall
  in exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.
      The three more positive institutes saw private consumption
  rising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,
  while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.
      They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but
  predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in
  1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.
      All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in
  unemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the
  jobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23
  mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in
  work of about 200,000.
      These three institutes said new jobs would be created
  mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in
  the context of job creation measures. The construction industry
  was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980
  but they predicted either no rise in employment in the
  manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.
      The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only
  in the tertiary sector, while ""the number employed in the
  manufacturing industry will decline.""
      The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to
  2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.
      They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58
  billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a
  current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks
  and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around
  100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.
      The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to
  rise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five
  predicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.

  Capital Partners Inc>.
      Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a

  new company, &lt;AV Holdings Corp>, will begin a 48.50 dlr per
  share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of
  Borg-Warner common stock.
      The offer will be followed by a merger in which each
  remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and
  54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated
  discount debentures.
      As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly
  owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said
  members of management do not plan to participate in the
  transaction, but they will retain their positions with the
  company.
      A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds
  19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares.
      GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share.
      Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to
  sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo
  security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
      Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for
  about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed
  a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the
  stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup
  values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and
  speculated an offer would have to be sweetened.
      In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the
  Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their
  shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its
  advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co.
      James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,
  said, ""We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction
  with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the
  employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its
  strong presence in the Chicago community.""
      Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer,
  which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject
  to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing
  arrangements.
      The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or
  51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered.
      Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to
  provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in
  subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments.
      Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with
  commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the
  financing required to complete the transaction.
      The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in
  the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying
  cash interest after five years.
      The debentures will be redeemable at the company's option
  for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at
  102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.
      The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity
  of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in
  the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before
  maturity.
      Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50

  was set at 128.2 in March after February's 129.6.
      The 1.1 pct fall in input prices between February and March
  was mainly due to a seasonal fall in industrial electricity
  costs and lower scheduled prices for petroleum products, the
  Department said.
      The Department said these falls were only partly offset by
  a rise in prices of home-produced food manufacturing materials.
      The seasonally adjusted index for input prices showed a 0.2
  pct rise between February and March.
      Year-on-year, the input price index was down 0.7 pct in
  March after a 2.8 pct drop in February.

  Norway's state oil company
  Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) &lt;STAT.OL>, has told
  Thai authorities it is interested in taking a 30 pct share in a
  big offshore Thailand gas field, Statoil said.
      The field, in the southern sector of the Gulf of Thailand,
  is currently operated by U.S. Oil company Texas Pacific Oil Co
  Inc, a unit of Canada's Seagram Co Ltd &lt;VO.N>. Thailand's state
  oil company &lt;Petroleum Authority Thailand> (PTT) also holds a
  major stake in the field.
      PTT wants to develop the field and has asked Statoil to
  consider co-development if the field's licence is renewed.
      PTT, according to Statoil, is currently negotiating with
  Texas Pacific to buy back the Dallas-based oil company's
  holdings in the field.
      ""PTT must first sort out its problems with Texas Pacific.
  When this is done, we have said we are interested in taking
  over a 30 pct share in the field,"" Statoil spokesman Willy Olsen
  told Reuters.
      Statoil, hired by PTT to carry out an independent appraisal
  of the field's reserves and propose a development plan, has
  estimated the field could be commercially developed at a cost
  of some 700 mln crowns.
      Industry sources said Texas Pacific has submitted lower
  reserve estimates for the field than Statoil and shown little
  interest in its development. Statoil refused to disclose its
  upgraded reserve estimate for the field.
      The field's reserves could be sold domestically through
  Thailand's gas distribution network or by converting the gas to
  electricity, the sources said.
      Sources would not say which field Statoil is considering.

  The five leading West German economic
  research institutes said the government should do more to
  stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of
  tax cuts planned for 1990.
      In their joint spring report the institutes were divided
  about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct
  expansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross national
  product grew 2.4 pct last year.
      But the report said all the institutes believed that ""more
  must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional
  jobs can be created.""
      The institutes said any step which improved basic economic
  conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. ""From this
  point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be
  brought forward.""
      The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion
  marks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from
  the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.
      However, the institutes criticised the government, not only
  for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of
  its financing had been left open.
      The government has not specified how the remaining 19
  billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,
  though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.
      The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had
  caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what
  exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a
  quick decision from the government.
      They also said the government should reduce tax
  preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a
  restriction of state spending and called for no increase in
  value-added tax.
      The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing
  subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.
      They referred specifically to a doubling of special
  writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a
  package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this
  as an increase in subsidies.
      The institutes said total subsidies, including tax
  preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen
  further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it
  should be possible ""despite ... Major political difficulties"" to
  finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.
      The institutes said that if the government raised value
  added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the
  positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.
      The report also noted that the government was progressing
  only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and
  said more deregulation was needed. The government had to aim
  for more competition, it said.

  A takeover battle began today for
  debt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> as TransCanada
  PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO> announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer and
  Dome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers.
      Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential
  buyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A> which is 70
  pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON.N>, &lt;PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd>
  which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd
  &lt;CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>.
      Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another
  proposal from ""a substantial company"" and discussions with a
  third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a
  statement.
      The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid,
  but did not identify the companies involved in talks.
      TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline
  operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common
  and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which
  would own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer
  is to Dome management, not to shareholders.
      Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,
  totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.
  It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.
      Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement ""violated
  the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered
  into with prospective purchasers"" and was apparently timed to
  prevent Dome from considering other proposals.
      It said the TransCanada bid ""seems to require favourable and
  substantial taxation concessions from the federal and
  provincial governments."" But Dome added that its management and
  financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.
      TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he
  was surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied
  that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. ""I find (Dome's
  statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to
  authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce
  it,"" he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the
  other bidders, or the terms of other offers.
      Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the
  Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at
  5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.

  Japanese trade figures are seriously
  challenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Group
  of Seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates
  are the key to smoothing world trade problems.
      Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo say
  they are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currencies
  are the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japan
  shrinking?
      What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down
  made world trade problems worse rather than solving them,
  fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast of
  world trade recession?
      U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar
  fall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five
  pact in New York.
      The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pct
  more competitive in Japan. The officials, most of them
  economists, can offer no objective reason why they are not.
      Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan rising
  rapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined
  only 11 pct against the yen.?
      Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely
  interpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar
  must go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct?
      At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials can
  only offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.
      ""I don't know and I don't think anyone knows,"" said Hugh
  Richardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo.
      ""What I do know is that Community exporters are making a
  hell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, there
  is money to be made in Japan,"" he added.
      But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S.
  Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive trade
  practices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such as
  agriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonable
  checking and customs procedures for car imports.
      Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in the
  face of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, they
  blame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive.
      ""We see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,""
  said a senior official, who declined to be named. ""We like to
  refrain from accusing them of not making enough effort.""
      Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito, chairman of the
  Keidanren business group, and Sony Corp chairman Akio Morita
  repeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to
  understand Japan's markets, and some foreigners agree. ""The real
  issue is the inability of major sectors of American and
  European industry to compete not only internationally but even
  in their home markets,"" Peter Huggler, President of Interallianz
  Bank Zurich, told a recent conference in Switzerland.

  U.K. Producer price data for March were
  roughly as expected after taking into account technical factors
  which affected the year-on-year outcome, economic analysts
  said.
      The figures showed a 0.3 pct provisional, non-seasonally
  adjusted rise in output prices in March, unchanged from
  February and close to the average for the last six months.
      The year-on-year rise was put at 3.7 pct, down from 4.2 pct
  in February.
      But Chris Tinker, economist at brokerage house Phillips and
  Drew, said the drop in the year-on-year rate mainly reflected a
  rise in excise duties which affected the index in March last
  year.
      He cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much into
  the monthly figure, adding that a rise of only 0.2 pct in April
  would take the year-on-year rise back above 4.2 pct.
      Analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers' input
  prices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factors
  such as a fall in industrial electricity costs.
      Duncan Squire of Lloyds Merchant Bank said the figures were
  slightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterling
  had not yet reduced input prices as much as expected.
      Both he and Tinker said this factor should help keep input
  costs down over the next few months, although Tinker added that
  last year's fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of the
  year-on-year comparisons and is likely to lead to a return to
  rises in the index rather than falls.

  West German Economics Minister Martin

      In a statement reacting to the five institutes' joint

  with exports falling by 0.5 pct. The other two saw only one pct
  growth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct.
      Bangemann said ""The government, agreeing with the majority,
  sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for
  exports expressed by the minority.""
      He said there was reason to believe that export demand

  A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome
  Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>
  may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door
  for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
      Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
  of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
  debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
  substantial payments to creditors will expire.
      Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders
  that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.
      Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
  public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
  negotiations.
      TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt
  restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
  Ltd said from Toronto.
      Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow
  creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
  to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
  cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
      ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
  even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
  Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""
  said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
  Calgary.
      TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome
  was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
  refinancing packages, Gobert said.
      The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome
  since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
  to agree to a restructuring, he added.
      ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
  any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said.
      Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
  TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
  the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other
  possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to
  us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
  reluctant to come forward,"" he said.
      Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal
  offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
  confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
      Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
  with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other
  unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and
  financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
  TransCanada's.
      Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price
  for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
      However, he said not enough financial details are known
  about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
  TransCanada's proposed offer.

"test/16216";"Corporate_Earnings";"1";"SOSNOFF RAISES BID FOR CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW>
  Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said he has
  raised his offer for Caesars World Inc shares to 32 dlrs each
  from 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seeking
  to 29.1 mln from all those not already owned.
      In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by his
  MTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the proration
  period will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer had
  been scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said he
  had received a ""negligible"" number of shares in response to the
  offer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate.
      Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln
  common shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a
  primary basis.
      Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan
  as an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders
  would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject
  to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in
  June.
      The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln
  dlrs in debt to finance the payout.
      Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the
  amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to
  give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on
  the arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by New
  Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities.
      He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all
  of Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a
  merger transaction.
      Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares
  he is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns,
  would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis.
      He said he still has received only a ""negligible"" number of
  shares in response to his tender.
      In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in
  the statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April
  8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to
  increase the price of his offer.
      Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in
  place.
      Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> has now delivered
  to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing
  dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding
  Corp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition.
      He said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, which leads a
  syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr
  margin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for
  further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to
  an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the
  purchase of shares under the offer.
      Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,
  each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,
  or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into
  Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an
  independent investment baking firm.
      He said ""To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares
  are purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a
  combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value
  of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars.""
      Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to
  Caesars' recapitalization.
      Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming
  officials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory
  process required for regulatory approval, a process that it
  already underway in New Jersey.
      He said his offer has been extended based on the likely
  duration of the regulatory process.
      He said he intends to further extend the offer if the
  approval process is not completed by the expiration date.

  Portugal's economy, which has been
  enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade,
  may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latest
  government crisis, analysts said.
      But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco
  Silva's government could slow economic reforms and investment
  as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European
  Community, which it joined in January last year, they said.
      Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, was
  toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.
      The centre-right administration had made economic growth
  reform a priority in its 17 months in office.
      In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its current
  account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and
  inflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.
      Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability
  were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued
  growth had not been badly shaken.
      ""The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is
  now less dependent on the political situation,"" said Fritz
  Haser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.
      ""The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet,"" economist
  Jorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters.
      Businessmen have identified political instability over the
  last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting
  economic progress.
      The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974
  revolution.
      Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remain
  buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge
  in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely
  underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.
      Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of
  Portugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell,
  predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth
  would remain at similar levels this year.
      But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies
  and could slow economic development.
      Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end
  of the month, can either call early elections or form a new
  government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated
  parliament.
      Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick
  elections as the best solution. ""There is a good chance that a
  majority government could result from early elections,""
  Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro
  Ferraz da Costa said.
      He said they were optimistic this could mean the
  continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies
  introduced over the last year.
      The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but
  the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls
  say they could win an overall majority.
      A PSD majority would also open the way for more
  wide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and
  possible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.
      Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties
  of blocking key economic reforms.
      The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic results
  were more the product of favourable international conditions
  such as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD
  policies.

  Columbia Gas Transmission
  corp said it made an abbreviated, streamlined filing with the
  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover a portion if
  its costs of renegotiating high-cost gas purchase contracts.
      Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiary
  said, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice a
  proposal to include these costs in the company's most recent
  purchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing.
      Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denial
  ruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternative
  filing if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing to
  include the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA or
  consolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filing
  and permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one.
      The company said the alternative filing seeks to recover
  about 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas sales
  commodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based on
  recovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period,
  beginning April 1, 1987.
      Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipeline
  commodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln.
      The company said it orginially sought to include these
  costs in its PGA since the payments to products resulted in
  almost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and were
  not related to take-or-pay buyout costs.
      It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April
  10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-pay
  buyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filing
  under the Natural Gas Act.
      As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas,
  Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average price
  paid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrs
  per mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April
  1985.
      The pipeline said Southwestern producers account for 46 pct
  of its total available gas supply this year.

  Hungary has announced sharp price
  increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of
  its efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit.
      The official MTI news agency said the government decided
  consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state
  spending. From today the price of meat will rise by an average
  18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said.
      The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated
  economy, and could help dampen Hungarians' appetite for
  imported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive
  hard currency, the diplomats said.
      The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect
  the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in
  other East Bloc states, notably Poland.
      MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive,
  with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also
  announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including
  higher pensions and family allowances.

  Member states of the European
  Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which
  they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open
  its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.
      Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC
  countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the
  willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese
  government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.
      However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as
  EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.
     Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to
  an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could
  raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.
  Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.
      The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations
  entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed
  to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of
  the U.S.
      The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's
  trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in
  March, up from 1.94 billion in February.

  The European Community (EC) has

  market to imports before it decides on possible tough
  retaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.
      They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26
  to review the state of trade relations between the two sides.
      The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of
  member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC
  pledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are
  ""adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market.""
      Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing
  stiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese
  exports.
      The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be
  discussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers
  on April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare
  proposals for possible retaliatory action.
      They said the commission has powers to take some limited
  action before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese
  exports of electrical, photographic and other goods being
  diverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves.
      In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to
  prevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a
  result of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obliges
  them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.

  Four of West Germany's five leading
  economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary
  growth threatened a resurgence of inflation.
      But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,
  echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said
  the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not
  necessarily threaten stability.
      The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which
  three -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in
  GNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.
      The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in
  view of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has
  shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price
  rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.
      Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may
  seem exaggerated, they said.
      ""But it has often turned out in the past that the price
  climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into
  a restrictive policy,"" they said.
      The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are
  less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.
      The four institutes disputed the view that monetary
  expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic
  investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market
  investments following lower interest rates.
      ""Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of
  central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a
  smaller expansion of money supply,"" they said.
      A return to growth and stability did not require
  spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with
  open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid
  an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.
      The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be
  focused simply on growth of production potential. Because of
  uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic
  weakness other factors should be taken into account.
      Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts
  and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation
  speculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat
  in itself to price stability.
      The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth
  reflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the
  falling mark.

  The U.S. Agriculture Department has
  lowered its ASCS terminal prices for low protein hard red
  winter and hard red spring wheat at a number of locations, a
  senior USDA official said.
      USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at Kansas
  City and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32
  cents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputy
  administrator of commodity operations at the Agricultural
  Stabilization and Conservation Service, said.
      The department also lowered the terminal price of hard red
  spring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said.
      In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hard
  red spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not to
  be identified said.
      The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago,
  Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as at
  Pacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis.
      The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and roll
  activity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided upon
  last week and will be effective today, he said.
      Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiums
  on high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheat
  prices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a protein
  premium would remain unchanged.

  Coopervision Inc said it is
  preparing a recapitalization plan, which includes a common

  common stock.
      The plan, along with a proposal to change its name to
  Cooper Cos Inc, will be submitted for shareholders' approval at
  the company's annual meeting on June 22.
      The meeting had been postponed from its original date of
  May 14 in order to let management review recapitalization
  options, it said.
      In addition, Coopervision said operating income in its
  current fiscal quarter ending April 30 is expected to show an

  its year ago quarter.
      Income from continuing operations was not immediately

      At a Drexel Burnham Lambert Investor Conference,
  Coopervision chairman Parker Montgomery said, as previously
  announced, he will listen to any bid that makes sense for
  shareholders.
      He also said Coopervision's stock fell in 1986 due to its
  second quarter loss, rumors of a liquidation at 30 dlrs and 35
  dlrs a share, and Ivan Boesky's subsequent sale of his
  position.
      ""The stock dropped six dlrs in three days after Boesky sold
  his position and has never recovered,"" Montgomery said. The
  company's stock is currently trading at 19-1/4.
      Montgomery further told the conference, ""Don't be an
  investor in the stock on the basis of any short term recovery

       Allied Stores is required to pay 200 mln dlrs in bank debt

  company could meet the payment.

      About 1.1 bilion dlrs in Allied assets had been targeted

  NCR Corp, earlier reporting higher
  first quarter profit, said it continues to expect that it will
  report record earnings and revenue for all of 1987.
      ""Our optimism is based on our incoming order rates and the
  strength of our product lines,"" the company said.
      NCR Corp plans additional new product announcements this
  year, it said without elaborating.
      NCR earlier said first quarter profit increased to 61.5 mln
  dlrs or 65 cts share from 50.2 mln dlrs or 51 cts share in the
  prior year. NCR's 1986 full-year earnings rose to 336.5 mln
  dlrs from 315.2 mln dlrs in the prior year.
      NCR said the increase in first quarter profit resulted from
  strong revenue growth, which was particularly strong in Europe
  and Pacific marketing groups.
      Growth in U.S. revenues also improved, the company said.
  First quarter revenues increased to 1.12 billion dlrs from
  960.8 mln dlrs in the prior year.
      NCR's U.S. dollar value of 1987 first quarter worldwide
  incoming orders posted a very substantial gain over the prior
  year first quarter, NCR also said without giving specific
  figures. Order growth was broad based across NCR's product
  lines, with the greatest growth coming from U.S., it said.

  Foster Wheeler Corp &lt;FWC> said an
  audit of its Stearns Airport Equiment Co Inc unit, revealed
  ""substantial discrepancies"" in Stearns accounts that may
  require material adjustments to previously announce
  consolidated results of the company and its subsidiaries.
      Foster said certain Stearn officers and senior management
  made Stearn's operations appear more profitable than they were
  by improperly recording job costs. It said Stearn's president
  and controller had resigned. A Foster spokesman said he did not
  know the names of the president and controller, and could not
  immediately comment on the release.
      Foster said the amount involved in the ""discrepancy"" is
  about 13.7 mln dlrs before taxes or about 8.2 mln dlrs net
  after tax due to an ""improper recording of job costs over a
  period of several years and continuing through part of the
  first quarter of 1987.""
      Stearns is a unit of Foster's Conergic Corp subsidiary.
  The company said the impact on its results for 1987 was not
  ""likely to be significant"" but the amount to be charged to
  prior periods had not been determined.
      Foster reported after tax earnings of 28 mln dlrs, 26 mln

  Taiwan announced plans for another round
  of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade
  talks with Washington which officials described as a move to
  help balance trade with the United States.
      Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's
  Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of
  products included 60 items asked by Washington.
      ""The move is part of our government efforts to encourage
  imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United
  States,"" he said.
      He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet
  that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,
  apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut
  by between five and 50 pct.
      The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday
  and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting
  on April 20, he added.
      Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700
  foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its
  growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's
  largest trading partner.
      Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and
  pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade
  deficit with Taipei.
      Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6
  billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It
  widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78
  billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.
      Today's announcement came before a departure later today of
  a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of
  trade talks with U.S. Officials.
      The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last
  night he was leaving with ""a heavy heart,"" meaning that he would
  face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist
  sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus
  with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.
      Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.
  Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,
  purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,
  import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.
      ""I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from
  our talks with the U.S.,"" he said without elaborating.

  Current prospects for this year's
  grain crop in Bulgaria and Romania appear less favorable than
  in 1986, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Belgrade

      The report said the assessment was based on travel in the

      It said crop conditions were better than earlier expected
  following the extreme dry conditions last fall and the
  prolonged winter temperatures this spring.
      However, in general plant development was at least three
  weeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions varied
  greatly by regions, the report said.
      Fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, and
  especially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about
  65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in good
  condition, with little evidence of winterkill, while others
  varied considerably, the report said.
      Fields lacking adequate moisture last fall showed weak and
  uneven stands. Spotty germination and winterkill in those
  fields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it said.

  Chemical New York Corp said its
  first-quarter profits fell by 16 pct, largely because it placed
  1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual.
      Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln
  dlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring the
  Brazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs in
  lost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax.
      A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs
  from 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise was
  mainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in
  consumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.
      Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,
  Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or
  4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.
      Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
  medium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are not
  resumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for the
  whole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.
      Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on
  non-accrual because the Quito government also suspended
  interest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interest
  income by 1.5 mln dlrs.
      Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs
  from 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from
  3.96 pct.
      This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, a
  reduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculation
  of the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and
  a narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical's
  cost of funds.
      Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from
  27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrs
  from 26.2 mln.
      Fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5
  mln dlrs from 129.3 mln a year earlier, Chemical said.
      The provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs, compared
  with 83.8 mln. Net loan charge-offs were 86.5 mln, up from 60.7
  mln, leaving the allowance for loan losses at 672.6 mln dlrs at
  quarter's end, or 1.74 pct of loans outstanding, compared with
  594.3 mln, or 1.50 pct, a year earlier.
      Non-accruing loans at the end of March were 2.39 billion
  dlrs (1.35 billion excluding Brazil), compared with 1.35
  billion at the end of 1986 and 1.22 billion at the end of

  National Westminster Bank USA said
  higher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantial
  increase in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise in
  first-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reported
  a year earlier.
      The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction of
  income as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual.
      Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with
  91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly to
  middle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But some
  of these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates.
      Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0
  mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losses
  was 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986.
      Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the
  end of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrs
  of loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status.
      The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for
  the remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced
  by about 4.9 mln dlrs.
      National Westminster Bank USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary
  of National Westminster Bank PLC.

  International Business Machines Corp
  has started the year aggressively, but industry analysts said
  the company still faces some tough rounds in its fight to stop
  a two-year earnings slump.
      ""I am more impressed with what's happening at IBM than I
  have been in a long time,"" said PaineWebber analyst Stephen
  Smith.
      ""But they're not out of the woods yet,"" he added.
      At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easily
  topped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from an
  even dollar to 1.20 dlrs.
      Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM's
  performance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a full
  recovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not be
  felt until later in the year.
      These include the success of IBM's new personal computer
  line, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,
  which will begin volume shipments in July.
      In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of its
  early-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves will
  emerge as the year progresses.
      Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers was
  relatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook than
  he has been for nearly a year.
      ""Although the worldwide economic situation remains
  unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,""
  Akers said, pointing to, among other things, higher
  first-quarter shipments. ""We remain optimistic about the
  prospects for both the industry and IBM,"" he said.
      ""Akers was most encouraging,"" said PaineWebber's Smith.
      A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframe
  computer sales all contributed to the better-than-expected
  first-quarter results, analysts said.
      ""Shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong in
  March,"" after a weak January and February, said Ulric Weil of
  Washington-based Weil and Associates.
      Sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes, commonly called
  the Sierras, ""bailed out the whole quarter,"" Weil said, adding,

  Irving Bank Corp said a six pct drop

  Brazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status.
      Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrs

      Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mln
  dlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received on
  these loans during the remainder of 1987.
      Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on the
  trading of securities and higher non-interest expenses,
  although these were partly offset by increased trust income,
  profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securities
  gains, the bank said.

  GTE Corp said the decline in its

      This loss is an increase from the 60 mln dlrs loss reported

  entering a joint venture with United Telecommunications &lt;UT> in
  July 1986. Under the joint venture, each company owns 50 pct of

      Earlier, the company reported net income declined to 265.0

      Theodore Brophy, chairman of GTE said, ""we expect US
  Sprint's losses to diminish later this year as customer traffic
  migrates to the new fiber-optic network for long distance
  telecommunications.
      The reason for the higher losses reflect lower prices as

  Goodyear's chairman and chief executive officer, also said 
  Goodyear expects to report a profit of more than one dlr a

      Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying

      Celeron consists of oil and gas reserves and an almost

  Calif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said Celeron's reserves
  would not be sold separately from the pipeline.
      Concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag for

      Mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit was

  GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-Warner
  Corp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to
  be preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company.
       Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for
  4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch
  Capital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for
  89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and
  securities for the balance.
      Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.
      ""I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in
  with another bid,"" said one analyst, who values the company at
  51 or 52 dlrs per share.
      GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of
  Borg-Warner's stock.
      ""You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up
  the price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have
  to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking
  at it - that it's worth more,"" Pershing and Co analyst Richard
  Henderson said.
      Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.
      GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill
  Lynch officials did not return phone calls.
      Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman
  sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics
  business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as
  telephones, computer terminals, and appliances.
      ""Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical
  operation these days,"" said Henderson.
      ""He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he
  does not like to get pushed around,"" said Henderson.
      GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover
  of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF
  did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its
  investment in Carbide.
      Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its
  Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer
  and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would
  give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.
      ""It's a win-win situation,"" said one analyst.
      One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be
  forthcoming shortly.
      ""I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this
  book,"" he said.
      Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,

      Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows
  GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it
  would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per
  share.
      ""I think there's a probability he goes up in price,"" said
  Rose.

  would do. ""Sam's a low-risk, high-return player.""
      ""Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical
  enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,"" Rose
  said.
      Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add
  earnings momentum to GAF. ""I worked out that paying as much as
  50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if
  they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,"" said John
  Henry of E.F. Hutton.
      Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986
  operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion
  dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net
  earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.
      ""The Borg chemical business is great,"" said Rose, adding
  its only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co &lt;MCT> and Dow
  Chemical Co &lt;DOW>.

  U.S. officials said they held out
  little hope the European Community, EC, would withdraw a
  controversial meat inspection requirement, due to go into
  effect April 30 and which U.S. meat producers claim will cut
  off their exports.
      But the officials said they expect the EC to allow U.S.
  plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the year
  provided they submit a plant improvement program with the U.S.
  Agriculture Department.
      The EC's so-called Third Country Meat Directive will
  require foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with EC
  inspection standards beginning April 30.
      The U.S. meat industry has prepared a petition requesting
  the Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule.
      At issue are U.S. meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mln
  dlrs in 1985.
      The EC rule would require all U.S. plants to make changes
  in their inspection methods, ranging from veterinary staffing
  to use of wood.
      Last December, the EC determined that only one U.S. cattle,
  one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approved
  without further review. USDA would have to certify that the
  plants had corrected the deficiencies.
      All remaining plants with a history or potential of
  shipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require more
  significant changes in plant constructions or procedures before
  further EC review.
      Robert Hibbert, general counsel for the American Meat
  Institute, said the meat industry expected to submit a formal
  trade retaliation petition by April 30.
      An interagency committee is reviewing the industry's draft
  petition.
      An official at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said
  U.S. officials continued to press the EC to withdraw the rule,
  but that ""the chances of that are not too good at this time.""
      However, there is the ""expectation"" in U.S. government and
  meat industry circles that the EC will continue to allow
  shipments, at least through the end of the calendar year, from
  U.S. plants that submit to USDA a plan on how they will bring
  their operations into conformity with the EC regulation, the
  USTR official said.

      Honeywell reported 1987 first quarter operating earnings
  rose to 43.7 mln dlrs or 96 cts a share from 36.4 mln dlrs or
  79 cts in the same period a year ago.
      Better operating results in each of the company's three 
  sectors offset higher interest costs in the first quarter due
  to financing the December acquisition of Sperry Aerospace and
  the sharing of the Federal Systems subsidiary pre-tax profit
  with Honeywell Bull Inc, Honeywell said.
      ""Our first quarter results show clear benefits of our
  restructuring,"" chairman Edson Spencer said. ""All of our
  businesses are producing better results than last year, even
  though we do not see significant improvement in the external
  market environment,"" he said.
      Total orders in the first quarter were up substantially,
  with a sharp increase in aerospace and defense orders in
  addition to those of the new Sperry Aerospace group, it said.
      Domestic industrial automation and control orders were
  modestly higher than the same period in 1986, it said.
      Orders in Honeywell's home and building automation and
  control business were flat in the U.S. and up in international
  markets, it said.
      International orders increased, with the greatest strength
  in Europe, Honeywell said.
      The company said that by year-end 1987, it intends to
  complete the repurchase of 3.3 mln shares remaining of a five
  mln share buyback program which began in 1986.

  OPEC's credibility faces fresh scrutiny

  could face fresh pressure from international oil companies
  seeking cheaper supplies.
      It did not say whether only OPEC or both OPEC and other
  producers were behind the reported rise in Mideast output. Nor
  did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts. 
     ""The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come under
  fresh scrutiny from today (Monday), with activity in the

      The sources were quoted as saying that after OPEC had in
  March demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, some
  members had raised output last week. It gave no details.
      ""Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec was

  Texaco Inc has re-established some key
  oil supply lines following yesterday's court filing for
  protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, said
  Elton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations.
      ""Several companies say they are willing to start trading,""
  Yates told Reuters in an interview.
      The company last week had stated that a number of domestic
  and international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil
  shipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.
  Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings.
      Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and other banks told
  Texaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texaco
  said in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> and J.P.
  Morgan Co's &lt;JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits
  to cover transactions, it said.
      The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose
  from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme
  Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> over
  the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.
      The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's
  plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.
      ""Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they
  could,"" Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court
  ruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting
  supplies.
      ""It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an
  avalanche,"" he said. ""Supplies were cut to the point where we
  could not run the system at anywhere near capacity.""
      He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in
  jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages
  by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton
  said.
      It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,
  canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,
  Occidental Petroleum Co &lt;OXY> demanded cash for crude, and
  Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> asked for special safeguards.
      The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC &lt;BP> last
  week refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today
  said, ""a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on
  supplying. They had cancelled last week.""
      He declined to identify the company.
      &lt;Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oil
  company that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also
  halted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said.
      But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the
  Venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key
  supply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the
  Algerians, he added.
      Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter
  11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines
  and oil supplies that are key to the company's business.
      ""It will be business as usual for Texaco,"" said Martin
  Klein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer
  and Traub.
      ""Creditors are a nervous bunch of people,"" he said. ""But
  when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and
  will likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company.""
      But other officials at Texaco were not immediately
  available to say whether discussions were being held with its
  banks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished.

      Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi

  ""The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its

      OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln
  bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.
      Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future
  depended on how much discipline OPEC showed.
      Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was
  ADNOC's most difficult ever but ""a practical and flexible
  pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market
  environment.""
      He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average
  609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales
  totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported.

  U.S. oil traders said Texaco Inc's

      ""The filing is holding up wet barrel trading today,"" said

       Some traders said companies that deal with Texaco are

  preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to

  South Korea has decided on major changes
  in its trade, investment and finance policies aimed at reducing
  the growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding a
  trade war with the United States, Deputy Prime Minister Kim
  Mahn-je said.
      Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exports
  could make South Korea too reliant on exports, increase
  nflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, which
  means abandoning Seoul's goal of rapidly reducing its foreign
  debt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings.
      Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said the
  current account surplus, previously expected to exceed eight
  billion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billion
  dlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisation
  and rationalising exports.
      He said Seoul would try to limit its current account
  surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next few
  years, although trade volume would continue to grow.
      ""This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP
  (gross national product) from the current five pct level to
  three pct by 1991,"" he added.
      Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea's foreign
  debt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the end
  of 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5
  billion dlrs at end-1986.
      ""But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected to
  remain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lower
  than the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs,"" he said.
      The policy change was announced two days before the
  scheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
  for talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae.
      South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateral
  trade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from
  4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.
      Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swing
  in South Korea's current account to a surplus of 2.06 billion
  dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mln
  dlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose
  36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs.
      The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5
  billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, raw
  materials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said.
      ""The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at
  1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), are
  considerable incentives given to increase imports,"" Koo said.
      Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency.
  ""It means they could become interest-free loans if the Korean
  currency continues to rise in value,"" he said.
      He said the South Korean won would be revalued against the
  dollar gradually, but added ""We do not believe in rapid one-shot
  changes in the value of the won.""

      Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's Economic
  Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister
  Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help
  Japan as well as the United States.
      The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by

      However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was
  already the world's largest grain importer.
      Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and
  depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food
  requirements in 1985.
      Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm
  products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on
  beef, citrus products and rice.
      Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of
  self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice
  because potential production is higher than domestic demand.
      The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of
  rising production by exporting countries, he added.
      Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product
  output with expensive programs, Maki said.
      Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussions
  on each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talks
  at a meeting on April 20, in which U.S. Trade Representative
  Clayton Yeutter will join.

  At least 60,000 tonnes of corn worth 240
  mln pesos have been smuggled into the Philippines over the past
  few months, the Manila Bulletin newspaper said, quoting an
  official in the National Food Authority (NFA).
      The official, who was not named, said a large corn shortage
  and corruption among customs and Coast Guard personnel have
  jeopardised the government's ban on corn imports, which was
  aimed at saving foreign currency.
      The newspaper quoted NFA Marketing Director Jig Tan as
  saying monthly corn consumption stood at about 331,000 tonnes
  against a national stock inventory of 191,732 tonnes.
      Tan said a continuing drought affecting about 49,150
  hectares of corn has led to the loss of 43,725 tonnes of corn
  worth 174.9 mln pesos and contributed to the shortage.
      The newspaper quoted Linda Geraldez, an NFA statistician,
  as saying despite the drought and the shortage, the total
  inventory at the end of the January/June crop season is
  expected to be at least 201,000 tonnes.

      He said if imports of gifts, foreign aid items and

  Basic reform of Japan's protected farm
  sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to
  domestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its trade
  surplus, securities analysts said.
      The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and
  quotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and
  sheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they
  said.
      ""In economic terms, reform would be a plus,"" said Christopher
  Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co.
      The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices
  twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S.,
  The analysts said.
      Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the
  average household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross
  national product (GNP), according to a study by Chew.
      Reducing these prices could increase household spending
  power by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent on
  products which would have a more direct impact in boosting
  domestic growth, it added.
      ""There's a lot of slack,"" a U.S. Government official in Tokyo
  said. ""All that money could be spent on something else.""
      Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector
  amount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent
  estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37
  billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.
      Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm
  on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential
  development would also give a boost to domestic spending,
  economists said.
      ""Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the
  expansion of domestic demand,"" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor
  at Kyoto Gakuen University.
      Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform
  to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic
  restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the
  farm sector. Employers groups also want change. ""If you really
  want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to
  raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,"" Bumpei
  Otsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'
  Associations told a recent press conference.
      External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek
  removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade
  deficits with Japan.
      But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well
  entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.
      Although the full-time farm population is falling and there
  are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban
  constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on
  farm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several
  city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.
      The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform
  plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,
  the analysts said.
      Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the
  traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for
  national food security, they said.
      Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to
  import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms
  aimed at stepping up productivity, they said.
      Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific
  pressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew.

      The OECD attributed the rise in consumer prices to the

  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
  opens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware
  his demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrus
  markets is likely to be rejected.
       But in an interview with Reuters during the flight to
  Tokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an
  international spotlight on Japan's agricultural import
  protection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open
  its markets.
      ""(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, but
  they are not going to give us anything,"" Lyng said.
      U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions
  during Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessions
  would be unveiled later this month, they said.
      ""If there is anything of consequence to offer (Prime
  Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him,"" when he
  visits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.
      Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by
  partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.
      A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last week
  requesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses
  such as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, saying
  Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.
      Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for
  beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would
  like to buy much more beef than currently allowed.
      He cited the example of a California company which
  transports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to
  circumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than
  the value of the animal, he said.
      U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion
  Corporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow
  from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986
  quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan
  has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.
      Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to
  eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by
  April, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually
  be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because
  liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese
  mandarin orange industry.
      The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because
  imports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And
  Japanese officials have said.
     Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy
  surplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,
  but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.
     Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,
  including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks in
  Geneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain
  minor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals.

  President Reagan today is to
  announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to
  retaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfair
  practices in semiconductor trade.
      The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of
  Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of
  experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.
      Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs
  on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors
  and television sets to power tools and photographic film.
      The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some
  20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa
  Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing.
      In his March annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed to
  full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide
  American industry with free and fair trade opportunities.""
      He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the
  pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world
  markets and opened its home market to U.S. products.
      U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March
  announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions.
      White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  ""we
  do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of
  action that requires meaningful action.""
      Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits,
  with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion.
      About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.
      Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to
  retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.
      He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent
  negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that
  existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.
      Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was
  as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not
  need any new trade legislation.
      The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring
  the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the
  results showed up.
      U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of
  Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and
  Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the
  Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports.
      Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would
  file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade
  (GATT).
      It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had
  violated the regulations of the global trading group and would
  approve compensation or Japanese retaliation.
      U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would
  retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with
  the United States.

      Yeutter, on the NBC program ""Today,"" said the United States
  did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop
  the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.
      He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials
  they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take
  time to monitor any compliance.
      Asked how long that would take, he said ""We want to see a
  pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would
  take a few weeks.""
      Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer
  impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods
  because the items selected are also readily available from
  other countries and manufacturers.
      He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.
      ""It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country
  to get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that
  full well,"" Yeutter said.
      He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but ""that's more of a
  paper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any
  adverse impact on U.S. trade.""
      Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor
  issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit
  later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
      He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a
  major issue, would be productive but ""I don't see any practical
  way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his
  visit.""

  The Commerce Department said on that
  insurance and freight costs for imported goods of 1.45 billion
  dlrs were included in the February trade deficit of 15.1
  billion dlrs reported on Tuesday.
      The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after
  the initial trade report to issue a second report on a ""customs
  value"" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance
  charges from the cost of imports.
      Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce
  Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion
  dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis.
      A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the
  foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers
  said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been
  revised downward.
      The Commerce department would like to have the law changed
  to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously.
      ""My feeling is the second one is a better report but there's
  legislation that requires us to delay it two days,"" said Robert
  Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.
      ""But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays
  any attention to the second figure.""
      The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a
  revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs.
      The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly
  trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in
  1979.
      Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includes
  customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison
  with other countries that reported their trade balances on the
  same basis.
      The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting
  freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable
  light for the Reagan administration.
      Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to
  eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures.
      ""We're considering it,"" he said, ""It's one of those dinosaur
  laws and I think it's time has come.""

  The tough trade sanctions President
  Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across
  Japan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade
  practices worldwide, U.S. officials said.
      But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings
  Institution, a think tank, said ""a shot across their bow can
  often result in a shot in our stern.""
      He said it left the United States open to retaliation.
      The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered
  on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress
  that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws,
  and no new protectionist legislation is needed.
      In the past year tough trade action had been taken against
  the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer
  and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights,
  patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.
      White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the
  tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a ""serious signal""
  to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.
      Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers,
  television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor
  an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at
  less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The
  tariffs were placed on items which were available from other
  sources so there would be little effect on the American
  consumer, Fitzwater said.
      Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action
  - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade
  practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.
      The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.
      The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion
  dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about
  one-third of America's overall deficit.
      But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West
  Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the
  president is ready to fight them all.
      Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that ""I regret
  that these actions are necessary,"" but that the health and
  vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to
  American competitiveness in world markets.
      ""We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading
  practices,"" Reagan added in the statement from his California
  vacation home at Santa Barbara.
      He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan
  abided by the agreement.
      U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -
  which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he
  already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.
      The White House aide said of the tariff action, ""it wasn't
  done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade
  practice.""
      The aide added, however, ""on another plane, it was an
  example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight
  unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major
  overall of our trade laws.""
      But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not
  in the best interests of the United States, and that
  negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.
      ""It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,"" he
  said, ""because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in
  trade.""
      Crandall said, ""the administration is doing this for its
  political impact across the country, and therefore its impact
  on Congress.""
      He said, ""I don't think it makes a lot of sense.""
      But other analysts said it made little difference whether
  the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,
  and that the main point was that the trading partners were on
  notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.
      Spokesman Fitzwater said ""we don't want a trade war,"" but the
  imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when
  it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

  Ecuador will use a new pipeline link
  with Colombia to export crude oil for the next five years,
  Colombian mines and energy minister Guillermo Perry said.
      The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to
  allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5
  by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline,
      Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its
  OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts
  contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador
  mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said.
      The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after
  signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation
  of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling
  will begin in September.
      ""The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only
  for this emergency period but for the next five years, with
  possibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels
  per day (bpd) will be pumped along it,"" Perry said.
      Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels

      The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will

  The south China province of Guangdong is
  importing millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas and

  to more profitable crops, the Peking Review magazine said.
      The official magazine said the province's grain area fell
  to 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of a
  total farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares.

  South Korea will cut import taxes on 50

      The tariff cuts, of between five and 30 percentage points,

      This brings to 157 the number of goods on which import
  taxes have been cut this year, a ministry official said.
      The 157 are among about 290 items on which Washington has
  asked Seoul to lower tariffs, he added.

  The use of tariffs and quotas to
  reduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will do
  little to cut the nation's swelling trade deficit, a government
  study said.
      In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said,
  such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products less
  competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of
  imported products that are re-exported in different forms.
      ""Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than
  help, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy,"" it said.
      The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilke
  and Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, which
  climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shifting
  currency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand.
      Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as
  foreign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrial
  competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions
  on mergers, added little to the problem, it said.
      ""Although each industry's competitiveness affects the level
  of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find
  that there have been no significant industry-specific changes
  affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in
  the overall trade deficit,"" the study said.
      ""To the extent any government action is needed to deal with
  the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide
  phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,""
  the FTC study said.
      Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts
  were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report
  said it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost some
  domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.
      It also said it found a ""fairly direct relationship"" between
  the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting
  currency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domestic
  demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign
  consumer demand.
      The study examined seven factors which have been commonly
  blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and
  trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of
  investment in U.S. Industry, declining research and development
  in U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil
  prices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.
      In each case, the study found little or no evidence that
  the factor had any impact on the trade deficit.

  Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)
  chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this
  month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community
  (EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.
      ""I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting
  up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries
  like the Philippines,"" Romero said in an interview.
      He said he did not know how much support the levy had
  within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed
  to the tax were under pressure to change their position.
      Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, the
  Netherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. But
  there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change
  sides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.
      Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning
  that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained
  dangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.
      He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per
  million parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to
  apply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra
  cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.
      Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it
  is not properly dried or ground.
      Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in
  London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC
  standards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,
  but this was likely to take several years of research.
      Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total
  coconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.
      Romero said he would also visit Oxford University's
  department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of
  avoiding the copra process altogether.
      ""There are ways of producing coconut products outside of
  copra,"" Romero said. ""We can process fresh coconut without drying
  the meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process
  coconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to
  the chemical root.""
      He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to
  become more protectionist and he expected export prices of
  coconut products to drop.
      ""In the long term we will be getting less and less for more
  and more production, and I'm not comfortable with that,"" he
  said.
      With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up
  production of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil
  output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.
      ""To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending
  billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by
  saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,""
  he said.
      Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to
  stay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a
  high of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,
  and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.
      Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year
  coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall
  after two successive years of good harvests.
      He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to
  add to the production fall, drought had affected output.
      ""Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the
  prices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep
  prices stable is by processing, adding more value,"" he said.
      Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by
  planting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.
      ""A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on
  10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space,"" Romero
  said. He said the government's proposed land reform program
  would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they
  had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.
      ""If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,
  production and employment then it won't happen,"" he said.
      PCA figures show about one-third of the country's
  population is dependent on the coconut industry.
      Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares or
  one-fourth of total agricultural land.

  Crude oil prices could remain around 18

  output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an
  official of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos
  (Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.
      Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of
  international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared
  to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself
  for the third quarter. ""Production is surging ahead of what was
  originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than
  envisaged a few months ago,"" he said.
      He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of
  production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the
  18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been
  envisaged might soften price levels.
      The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in
  Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output.
      ""I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in
  terms of volume decisions,"" Lajous said.
      A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted
  output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is
  always there as a possibility, he said.
      ""I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I
  expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and
  discipline will be maintained,"" he said.
      Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as
  this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil
  markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during
  1987 if output remains under control.
      He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that
  increased production was not so important as long as incomes
  would not be affected by the output, were ""very relevant and

      The two Steelworkers locals representing the office and

  Dutch cocoa processors are unhappy with
  the intermittent buying activities of the International Cocoa
  Organization's buffer stock manager, industry sources told
  Reuters.
      ""The way he is operating at the moment is doing almost
  nothing to support the market. In fact he could be said to be
  actively depressing it,"" one company spokesman said.
      Including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on Friday, the total
  amount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he
  recently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes.
      Despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the
  1,600 Special Drawing Rights, SDRs, a tonne level below which
  the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market.
      ""Even before he started operations, traders estimated the
  manager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnes
  maximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 SDR level,
  and yet he appears reluctant to do so,"" one manufacturer said.
      ""We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy
  up to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simply
  step back,"" he added.
      ""The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the
  market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the
  market because everyone is holding back from both buying and
  selling waiting to see what the manager will do next,"" one
  processor said.
      ""As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is
  likely to stay in the doldrums, and I see no indication he is
  about to alter his methods,"" he added.

  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's
  forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will
  almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be
  surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.
      The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'
  Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal
  Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or
  end-of-season stocks.
      However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end
  1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln
  was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.
      The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast
  in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for
  soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and
  the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.
      This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around
  31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of
  Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares
  against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.
      ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign
  will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC
  official said.
      Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to
  estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and
  to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.
      He said, however, that among countries to which France
  could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb
  countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.
      The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in
  1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,
  was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize
  Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.
      Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were
  expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.
      It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,
  down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.

  The Zambian government today announced
  minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new
  economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the
  northern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.
      However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,
  were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could
  provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more
  sweeping reductions.
      Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the
  small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on
  items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.
      Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said
  government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.
      In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign
  of troops or police reinforcements on the streets.
      President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take
  account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the
  kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.
      The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic
  strategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerity
  program.
      Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs of
  unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile
  region to take action against shops that did not reduce their
  prices after today's deadline. Fifteen people were killed in
  the Copperbelt during food riots last December after the
  government tried to lift maize subsidies.

  India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas
  Commission (ONGC) plans to drill more wells in the Bombay
  offshore area, where a well spudded in February this year gave
  both oil and gas, an ONGC spokesman said.
      The exploratory well, spudded at a depth of 2,140 metres,
  yielded 2,000 barrels of oil and 180,000 cubic metres of gas
  per day, he said.
      ""The well, one of the four structures drilled in the area 80
  km north-west of Bombay, indicates good prospects of both oil
  and gas. We've decided to drill at least three more wells in
  there before starting production on a commercial scale.""
      Production of Bombay High, part of the Bombay offshore
  field, has stabilised at around 500,000 barrels per day for the
  last two years.
      ONGC produced 27.85 mln tonnes of crude in 1986/87 ending
  March, up from 27.51 the previous year. Bombay High accounted
  for 20.61 mln tonnes, marginally up from 20.10 the year before.
  India's total oil output is around 30 mln tonnes.
      ONGC has been exploring the Bombay offshore area, developed
  since the late 1970s, for more oil as production from Bombay
  High has reached a plateau.

  Saudi Arabia's renegotiation of its
  collective agreement with Aramco to purchase oil for the
  latter's ex-partners is moving along and should lead to a
  fundamental structural change in the contract, oil industry
  sources said.
      Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, in this Monday's edition,
  said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34
  mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices and
  volumes and other terms may be rearranged.
      The agreement signed in January for the months from
  February to June is up for renegotiation.
      Under the January contract Aramco was to purchase 1.34 mln
  bpd for the four partners allocated among them as Exxon Corp
  &lt;XON> 440,000 bpd, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> 350,000 bpd, Mobil Corp
  &lt;MOB> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> 550,000 bpd between them.
      But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarter
  allowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift its
  obligations under the contract
      PIW said that that one alternative under consideration is
  to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective
  agrement.
      John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research
  Foundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of
  a formality as the Saudis have each company on a separate
  schedule although separate agreements with the companies would
  favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted
  liftings occur .
      ""The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants within
  limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long
  haul,"" he said.
      Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely
  concentrate on volume rather than price.
      Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted
  and in April industry publications said that renegotiation were
  being sought, a fact later confirmed by Reuters with Aramco.
      Aramco Corp was formerly owned by Chevron Corp &lt;CHV>, Exxon
  Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX> but is now
  owned by Saudi Arabia which bought its assets although the

      The sources, who asked not to be named, said the government

  taking over only after production starts in the early 1990s.

      It was unlikely the government would announce its decision

  that, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieve

  A trade bill before the United States
  House of Representatives ""is a very dangerous bill for Canadian
  industry,"" Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam
  Zimmerman told reporters.
      By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S.
  countervailing duty law, House of Representatives Bill 3
  removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely
  used government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing.
      ""Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grant
  rights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could be
  vulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language,"" he
  said.
      The Canadian forest lobby's Zimmerman also said the House
  of Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuring
  subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any
  countervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadian
  resource exports to the U.S.
      Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices and
  U.S. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, he
  said. Such a method would make Canadian resource industries
  vulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export tax
  imposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumber
  to the U.S., Zimmerman added.
      Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a U.S.

  Traders recently returned from West Africa
  say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action
  so far by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer
  stock manager on buffer stock purchases.
      One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the
  Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the
  International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows.
      So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been
  taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted,
  only on an intermittent basis.
      They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week
  he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the
  limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000
  in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him.
      The traders recently returned from West Africa say
  producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so
  far, noting producing countries are part of the international
  cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers.
      London traders say terminal market prices would have to
  gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day average
  indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference
  price).
      However, little progress has been made in that direction,
  and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower
  intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously.
      The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be
  making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the
  agreement such action is not automatic, traders said.
      Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager
  are not confined to West African producers, they observed.
      A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources
  there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the
  intermittent buffer stock buying activities.
      In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than
  21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total
  potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes.
  Carryover holdings from the previous International Cocoa
  Agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes.
      Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from
  Friday's close, basis July at its high of 1,271.
      It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from
  the market, prices go up, while when he declares his intention
  to buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said.

  Flooding in the Red River on the
  Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a
  24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per
  day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a
  Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.
      ""The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any
  divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility
  that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week,"" a company
  source said.
      The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and
  one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.
      Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is
  restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring
  oil which has been lost to the flood.
      ""But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be
  difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like
  to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to.""
      The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield
  Corp &lt;ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell
  Group &lt;RD> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, which is the pipeline's
  operator.
       Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude
  oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to
  new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.
      July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to
  19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.
      Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of
  WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.
      Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline
  shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West
  Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a
  barrel below WTI, respectively.
      Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
  Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days
  but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River
  recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is
  dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area
  affecting the pipeline, Stevens said.
      He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was
  underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.
  The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil
  nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was
  apparently washed away.
     
      The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed
  at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this
  line.
      Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not
  found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma,
  which is nearby.

      Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in comments

  participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharing
  program of the International Energy Agency.

  The dollar's recent signs of stability
  have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,
  but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until
  after the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.
      ""The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the
  dollar has bottomed out,"" said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.
      Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value
  against the yen and the mark as part of an officially
  orchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive on
  world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.
      On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen
  but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,
  topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.
      Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far
  enough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.
      The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in March
  from 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continued
  improvement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.
      Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if
  further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up
  towards 150 yen.
      ""There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed
  out for the medium term,"" added Tom Campbell of First National
  Bank of Chicago.
      Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing
  expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would
  be reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan's
  larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and 
  more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.
      The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampen
  speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central
  bank intervention to support the dollar.
      The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that
  the U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billion
  dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount
  since the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.
      Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's intervention
  volume as ""impressive"".
      James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,
  however: ""the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the trade
  data are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and
  140 yen.""
      Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York
  warned, ""I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet.""
      Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okada
  said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of
  the U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.
      Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction
  to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,
  which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous
  commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.
      President Reagan said today, ""economic policy decisions
  made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of
  Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be
  ignored or forgotten.""
      ""The commitments made at these meetings need to be
  translated into action,"" he added in a speech, celebrating the
  40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.
      Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,
  analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the
  brunt of U.S. calls for further action.
      Marine Midland's O'Neill said, ""pressure will build up on
  Germany to take stimulative action like Japan.""
      Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar
  could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come
  under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is
  not having much impact on Japan's economy and its trade
  surplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trust
  banks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar
  positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign
  portfolios, while some others have started covering those short
  positions, Japanese bank dealers said.

"test/17883";"International_Trade";"3";"NO REASON TO CUT RATES - BUNDESBANK'S SCHLESINGER
  Bundesbank vice president Helmut
  Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.
      With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in
  May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,
  Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that a
  further cut in interest rates was needed.
      The economy is picking up, after contracting by a
  seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from
  the fourth, he added. ""We may have an increase in gnp starting
  in the second quarter,"" he said in an interview.
      Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has been
  pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its
  imports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.
      Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was
  mainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in
  1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.
      He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole
  would probably be between one and two pct.
     ""It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic
  demand does not grow strongly,"" he said, noting that interest
  rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.
      Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money
  stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace
  of 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to six
  pct target.
      He said the target could still be achieved but much will
  depend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavy
  inflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS
  revaluation, boosted domestic money supply.
      ""There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of
  foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit
  reversed,"" Schlesinger said.
      A major reason for the inflows was the market's conviction
  that the mark was headed higher. ""As we can see from the market,
  expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have
  diminished,"" Schlesinger said.
      The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the
  fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period
  and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined
  towards stabilizing the dollar, he said.
      Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar
  rise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87
  marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.
      At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.
      ""Central banks are always in contact about these
  fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,""
  Schelsinger said.
      ""One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,"" he said,
  adding, ""It is not only our own case, it is also the American
  case.""
      He said that the West German export industry has been hit
  hard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to see
  some correction now. ""But it wouldn't be good to have short-term
  fluctuations,"" he said. ""Let us wait and see.""
      ""It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very
  short period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level
  (of rates) as such,"" Schlesinger said.
      The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of
  such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West
  German inflation down year.
      Although there have recently been signs of inflation
  picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key
  commodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year would
  be unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.
      Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth
  was longer term, in that the economy was building up the
  potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.
      The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16
  months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of
  targets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the
  mid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.
      But he added: ""I don't see any great pressure to go away
  from it.""

  Deregulation of Japan's oil industry could
  mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into
  bigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.
      They said the relaxation of controls was now under review
  by the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry (MITI).
      A spokesman for a major firm said, ""Deregulation would bring
  about a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freer
  competition, we have no choice but to accept it.""
      The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12.
      The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it
  should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. It
  should cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct of
  current capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput and
  gasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished.
      They said deregulation was vital to promote more
  competition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable.
      ""Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turn
  to see if we can survive cut-throat competition,"" said a source
  at one major Japanese oil company.
      A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, ""We'll have a hard
  time surviving, but that's something we must go through.""
      ""In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for
  the oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching out
  further into other lines such as real estate and travel
  agencies,"" he said.
      Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltd
  which had the largest share of refined products sales in the
  Japanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refining
  capacity in fiscal 1986.
      Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil products
  in 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, a
  spokesman for the company said.
      Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of the
  Council, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies
  within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the
  efficiency of the industry.
      Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to
  be streamlined further into five refining groups.
      ""MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups to
  merge into five to build up their muscles,"" a source said.
      A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out the
  possibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industry
  in the event of the relaxation of oil controls.
      He declined to officially confirm or deny that the
  Petroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures but
  said that in principal MITI would encourage a move towards
  deregulation.

  from a year earlier.
      ""I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it
  (growth) short,"" Fernandez said.
       NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the
  fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNP
  growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.
      ""Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources
  and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that
  domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and
  would not be a stumbling block,"" Fernandez said.
      ""I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at
  key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,
  showed that the economy was on a different track from last
  year,"" he said.
      Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the
  first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it
  could drop off in the third quarter.
      He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the
  manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in
  1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.
      ""That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,"" he said.
      He said the government had met all monetary targets set for
  the first quarter in consultation with the International
  Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth
  tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon.
      The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling
  58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988.
  Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or
  August to review performance in the January-June period.
      He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion
  dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs.
  Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their
  net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.
      ""It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA
  (official development assistance) accounts the commercial
  banking system will be requested to hold the line,"" he said.
      It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF
  debt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said.
      The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28
  billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March.
      Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984
  to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in
  April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in
  October last year, had almost been completed.
      He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level
  touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well.
  ""Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,"" he said.
      Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, ""I
  think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own
  receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap
  forward as might have been suitable.""
      The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach
  29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.
      NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first
  quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.
      Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of
  between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while
  growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.
      Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some
  economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the
  dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more
  competitive.
      ""By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso
  has already substantially devalued against all of the country's
  trading partners,"" he said.
      On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was
  opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted
  repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two
  years after the imposition of the Code.
      The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has
  been delayed by objections from some business groups.
      ""I think any central bank, certainly this one after the
  events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be
  prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds
  and I'm not about to do that,"" Fernandez said.
      ""It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of
  capital and earnings can be free,"" he said.
      ""We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainly
  we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external
  availabilities simply by servicing our debts.""

  Figures for first quarter 1987 West
  German GNP will be published on June 11 after they were
  provisionally scheduled for June 4, an official at the Federal
  Statistics Office said.
      The official said there had been a delay in gathering
  information for the data, which are expected to show that the
  West German economy contracted in the period.
      A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said there
  was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on
  June 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends.
      ""There is no political motivation. It is a purely technical
  matter,"" he added.
      The West German government is expected to come under
  pressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partners
  to stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international
  trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.
      However, government officials have ruled out any further
  tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of
  stimulatory fiscal measures already underway.
      Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West German
  central bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, the
  widest measure of a country's economic activity, fell in real
  terms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first
  quarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.
       The government has confirmed that growth was negative in
  the first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected to
  be about two pct.
      Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank's reluctance to
  cut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate,
  at three pct, is just above historical lows.
      West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice
  summit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad,
  is already outstripping export performance, which has suffered
  from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over
  two years.
      The government has pointed out that depressed exports are
  the main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but
  says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will
  compensate for this setback.
      It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just under
  two pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.

  China will not increase sugar imports
  substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints
  and large stocks, despite falling production and rising
  domestic demand, traders and the official press said.
      ""Despite rapid increases in domestic production over the
  last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to
  be extremely serious,"" the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986
  plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because
  farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical
  and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.
      The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop
  (November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year
  earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.
      The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500
  tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier
  figure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China
  News Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure.
      The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province
  fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the
  area under sugar was dropping.
      ""Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate,"" the newspaper
  said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of
  nearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane
  is a major problem.""
      A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian,
  south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in
  area planted.
      He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel
  developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the
  maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.
      The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province
  of Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667
  hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only
  70 from one mu of sugarbeet.
      The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to
  4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.
      Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed
  with each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in
  falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills.
      The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the
  official press has said.
      Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of
  sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.
      The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln
  tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.
      A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks
  in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import
  sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986
  when the central government resumed control of imports.
      ""As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored
  in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas,"" the diplomat
  said.
      The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to
  consumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly
  as coal had priority. ""How quickly they can move the sugar is
  one factor determining import levels,"" he said.
      Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba,
  China's major supplier through barter trade, he said.
      ""China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about
  152/153 dlrs a tonne,"" he added. ""China is not a desperate buyer
  now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into
  the open market.""
      A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regarding
  imports was price.
      ""While the foreign trade situation has improved this year,
  foreign exchange restraints persist,"" he said.
      The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five
  pct a year but ""a communist government is in a much better
  position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the
  foreign exchange situation demands it.""

  Britain's gold and currency reserves rose

  The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K.
  Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for a
  further cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11
  general election, market analysts said.
      Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected
  number but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.
      But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now
  available to the authorities to support the pound should curb
  any market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show the
  ruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added.
      ""We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than
  we have done hitherto,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
  said at a news conference today, commenting on the news of the
  record reserves rise.
      He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvre
  accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the
  dollar, partly through direct intervention on foreign
  exchanges. ""We have been playing a very full part ourselves,"" he
  said.
      But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on
  sterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp down
  its rise, more in the light of local factors.
      Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities,
  said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain
  amid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears last
  autumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out.
      U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign
  buyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields as
  attractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notably
  equities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.
      Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower
  interest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse
  the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.
      Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves
  news, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of
  currencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0
  pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.
      ""The market doesn't want to do anything because of the
  election,"" commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.
      Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of
  a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had
  overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to
  have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the
  forward market.
      The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of
  sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth
  the pound's sudden downturn, while some of the intervention
  reported in May probably occurred in April, they said.
      The key three months interbank money market rates eased
  about 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend
  in U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reserves
  news, analysts said.
      Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was
  muted as traders worried about the funding implications of
  another huge rise in reserves, they added.
      Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cut
  from the current nine pct level soon after the election, so
  long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove
  accurate, with another half point later.
      Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit Suisse
  Buckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might be
  possible. ""Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in
  future, rather than this active intervention,"" he predicted.
      Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned
  against over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut
  looked likely.
      A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.
      ""The Bank (of England) is both worried about the political
  problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... And
  has signalled some worry about broad money (growth),"" said Robin
  Marshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities.
      He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in
  the past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into the
  European Monetary System.
      But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10
  or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did
  so. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in.

  South Africa is expected to unveil
  tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year
  in a bid to boost the nation's flagging economic growth rate,
  economic analysts said.
      Faced with competing demands for increased military and
  police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black
  housing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is
  expected to raise significantly the government's overall
  expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament,
  the analysts said.
      Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state
  spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the
  financial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleas
  from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes.
      ""Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, but
  simply raising government spending and increasing the budget
  deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation,"" said Rob Lee,
  chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co.
      South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted
  growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of
  less than one pct.
      Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5
  pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to
  over 30 pct.

  will rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted at
  around 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficit
  before borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of
  GDP.
      The government, having consistently overshot its own
  spending targets for more than a decade, also faces a
  credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the
  budget, analysts said.
      ""The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,""
  said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.
      Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less
  attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using
  their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the
  money and capital markets.
      South African Mutual's Lee believes government spending
  will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49
  billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5
  pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the
  IMF.
      ""The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,"" predicted
  one analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away
  from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past
  two years.
      The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the
  political situation and the onset of an economic crisis
  triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over
  loans to the country in September 1985.
      Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling
  per capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,
  government officials say economic growth is the prime
  objective.
      But private-sector economists caution that the government's
  ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is
  constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the
  current account of the country's balance of payments.
      Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5
  billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the
  nation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an
  arrangement reached earlier this year with major international
  creditor banks.
      Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has
  little room to manoeuvre.
      Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and
  budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and
  South African Transport Services suggest that major tax
  concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.
      Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions
  for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only
  election. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget.
      ""This will not be a very exciting budget,"" commented Harry
  Schwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive
  Federal Party. ""I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the
  sweets were given out before the election.""

  Pakistan says its economy has continued
  its recent outstanding performance during the financial year
  1986/87 ending on June 30 but areas like balance of payments,
  investments and energy were causing concern.
      GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980
  and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, according
  to a government economic survey.
       The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum
  and there was an impressive performance in a five point
  government program for rural uplift, education and poverty
  alleviation, said the survey.
      Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a news
  conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms
  damaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pct
  compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might now
  slide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.
      The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine
  pct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end.
      Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from
  2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, home
  remittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs
  from the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.
      More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments
  situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in
  home remittances, he said.
      The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to
  2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of
  the boost in exports.
      He said national investment continued to be small because
  of a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said more
  savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the
  present growth rate and to finance the country's seventh
  five-year development plan to be launched in July 1988.

  Italy's barley crop is generally in good

  The current crude oil price of between
  18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next couple
  of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to
  keep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said.
      Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade
  officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint
  by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government
  officials said.
      They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made
  the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third
  World debt and industrialised nations.
      Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher
  energy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said.
      Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the
  beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial
  countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead
  to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he
  said.
      This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high
  prices, he added.

  The West German government's independent
  council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of
  the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman Friedhelm
  Ost said.
      A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor
  Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council
  said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two
  pct was achievable.
      It added the council believed ""an intensification of the
  already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial
  policy is not called for.""
      Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure on
  West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not
  increase.
      The government regularly uses the term ""changed external
  economic factors"" when referring to the fall of the dollar,
  which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials
  have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but
  could still fall below the 1986 level.
      Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany
  agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in
  February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.
      The stance taken by the experts backs up the official
  position of the West German government ahead of next week's
  seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be
  pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.
      West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not
  in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due
  next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.
      The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official
  interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.
      The experts' prediction for economic growth this year of
  between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a
  forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.
      Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987
  predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The government
  itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct,
  compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.

  April should be lifted, U.S. officials said.
      They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked at
  Japan's adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact
  yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.
      But there was no hint what the announcement might be.
      Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of
  Japanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to be
  honoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.
      But they also noted that the White House has said it was
  unlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the
  world's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10.
      The officials added that while the curbs complicated
  U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt 
  Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not
  taking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.
      Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for
  Japan's failure to honor commitments to end dumping
  semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs
  and to open its own market to U.S. goods.
      The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese television

  U.S. analysts expect the American
  Petroleum Institute's weekly report on oil inventories to show
  a slight build in U.S. stocks of gasoline for the week ended
  May 29, oil traders and analysts said.
      While the consensus is for an increase, a few would not
  rule out the possibility of an decline. Traders said that
  barring any surprises in tonight's report, they expect the
  report to be neutral to bearish for oil prices.
      Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to be
  steady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oil
  prices, the analysts said.
      Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming imports
  continue at relatively high levels.
      Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mln
  barrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22.
      Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, who
  looks for a build said, ""We have had five weeks of gasoline
  demand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off to
  between 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demand
  would have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw,"" he added.
      Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a draw
  in stocks of about of about one mln barrels.
     
      The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latest
  report for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasoline
  demand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year.
      But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely to
  founder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3
  pct above May 22's 81.2 pct capacity operated.
      Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and add
  to U.S. stocks.
      But some analysts said that refiners may have held refinery
  runs.
      Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between
  700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel level
  reported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks was
  discounted as having a market impact at this time.
      ""A build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year,""

  U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said
  the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Tokyo last
  week went further than the U.S. Had expected.
      But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic
  sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo
  changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips.
      Speaking in a televised news conference linking several
  European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the
  Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and
  global demand.
  
      ""There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was
  originally thought,"" said Shultz, speaking from Washington.
      ""It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked
  about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here.
      ""It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe
  that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the
  economy,"" he added.
      But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news
  conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might
  decide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on
  some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied:
      ""These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an
  agreement that had been reached between the United States and
  Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip
  market.
      ""They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the
  agreement that it made become evident.""
      He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the
  situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a
  trend on only one month's data.
      The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal
  computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that
  Japan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by
  selling computer chips at below fair market value.
      Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do
  well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.
      Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to
  take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold
  American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget
  deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the
  problem.

  Developing countries said the European

  went ahead with its plans for an oils and fats tax.
      Ambassadors to the EC from African, Caribbean and Pacific
  (ACP) states told a press conference the tax would hit the
  exports of 26 ACP countries.
      They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedures
  laid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relations
  between ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affect
  trade between the two sides.
      They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertaking
  not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current
  Punta del Este round of world trade negotiations being held
  under GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices.
      The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 European
  currency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-produced
  vegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which could
  raise up to two billion Ecus a year.
      EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax,
  are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a
  marathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg on
  June 15.
      Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries are
  convinced this would lead to EC industry substituting products
  made within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimates
  this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its
  member country exports.
      ""We can't believe the EC would willingly take measures to
  undermine our countries, but such would be the impact of these
  measures,"" Wilson said.
      The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hit
  by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it
  is approved.
      Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only ""as a very
  last resort,"" but added that the ACP is in touch with other
  countries which oppose the plan.
      Wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clear
  Jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not
  export oils and fats.
      Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast,
  Senegal, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, the ACP says.

  Nearby months in soybean and soymeal

      ""A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worried
  about where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,""
  one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.
      Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers for
  the few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with a
  Decatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bid
  another two cents today to 10 over July futures.
      Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light,
  with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willing

      Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the belief
  that even if futures rally back to last month's highs, country
  movement may remain light because farmers in many areas are
  sold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern half
  of the Midwest.
      Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtime
  for maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducing
  the weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping the

      The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude
  oil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 days
  preceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said.

  Falls, Kan, on Saturday due to an undetermined leak at the Red
  River crossing, near the Oklahoma/Texas border, because of

  Overseas Shipholding Group Inc president
  Morton Hyman said if oil production by OPEC rises during the
  second half of 1987, freight rates for tankers should rise
  accordingly.
      Hyman, delivering a speech at the annual shareholders
  meeting, said international tanker markets were generally weak
  throughout the first quarter, but since the end of March OPEC
  oil production has picked up. The result has been a modest
  improvement in tanker rates.
      Overseas said 73 pct of its fleet handles liquid cargo.
     
      He said tanker requirements decreased in September 1986 as
  OPEC production quotas dropped and levels of oil stocks rose.
      For the first quarter 1987, the company reported net income
  of 10.3 mln dlrs, or 40 cts per share, compared to 9.3 mln
  dlrs, or 36 cts per share, for the comparable quarter a year
  ago.
      The company reported net income for 1986 of 37.3 mln dlrs,
  or 1.45 dlrs per share.
     
      ""The improvement in the company's 1986 results, after four
  years of declining earnings, reflects a sharp, albeit
  temporary, rise in freight rates in the international tanker
  markets last summer,"" Hyman said.
      He said the Alaskan oil trade continues to be the principal
  source of employment for its U.S. flag tanker fleet, which
  represents approximately 15 pct of the company's tonnage.
      Overseas owns and operates 67 vessels.

  With more private investment, not more
  protection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitive
  with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two
  congressional agencies said today.
      The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of
  Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing
  there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S.
  textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for
  optimism than a few years ago.
      ""While textile producers are making significant
  investments, they could do more,"" OTA analyst Henry Kelly said.
      The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan
  budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan
  guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than
  increased trade protection which could lead to foreign
  retaliation.
      CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections,
  first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit for
  profits and investments of domestic firms.
      Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the
  agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against
  congressional approval of protectionist textile quota
  legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other
  Asian textile producing countries.
      President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill
  but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is
  expected to be voted on in the House this year.
      However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of
  a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles
  showed a weakening of support for the legislation.
      Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign
  producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production
  equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic
  markets, Kelly said.
      He added that private investment in the textile and
  clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh
  the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.
      Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of
  textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct
  while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.
      ""The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by
  new technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the
  industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets
  that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research
  indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered,
  and that exports can be expanded,"" Kelly said.

  Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pct
  to 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln a
  year earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.
      The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for
  poultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef
  cattle raising, Ministry officials said.
      Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87
  against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were
  217,554 tonnes against 224,101.
      Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnes
  from 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.
      The officials said corn imports rose because the world
  surplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reduced
  Chicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in
  1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.
      Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87
  from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from
  18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices due
  to poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as
  Argentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.
      Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln and
  the compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.
      The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from
  increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.
      Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against
  528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pct
  from 2.1 pct.

  South Korea's gross national product (GNP)
  will exceed 10 pct real growth this year and the won will rise
  further as long as the current account surplus continues to

      Chung, who is also Minister of Economic Planning, said his
  GNP estimate was based on the assumption that the economy will
  remain stable.
      The official target for 1987 GNP growth is eight pct.
      GNP rose 15.6 pct between the first quarters of 1987 and
  1986, according to provisional Bank of Korea figures.
      GNP rose 12.5 pct in calendar 1986.
      In the first four months of this year, the current account
  swung to a surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs from a deficit of 294
  mln dlrs in the same 1986 period.

  Fiji sugar farmers will receive an interim
  payment on the 1986 crop, four months ahead of schedule, in a
  move aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 crop
  under way, Governor-general Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau said.
      Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop
  indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record
  501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December)
  crop year.
      The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced
  486,790 tonnes.
      For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed
  harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the
  Governor-general to demands following the May 14 coup.
      Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make
  a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for
  the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers
  for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills
  by June 23.
      Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June
  23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said.
      The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the
  full amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds
  received to-date. The balance will be paid in October.
      Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of
  23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to
  the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled
  Fiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said.
      However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of
  14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the
  forecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane
  harvested by November 30, he said.
      Ganilau said, ""This will be at least one month in advance of
  the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The
  balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the
  end of crushing.""
      Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an
  estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB)
  for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off.
  The FDB rejected this request.
      Ganilau said, however, ""The bank is prepared to carefully
  consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of
  hardship on a case-by-case basis.""
      In response to a further demand that all soldiers be
  removed from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army
  would restrict its presence in the cane areas.
      He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to
  harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions
  to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the
  commencement of harvest.
      Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had
  indicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible,
  he added.

  European coffee traders and roasters
  may propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee
  Organization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting
  here this week, traders and officials told Reuters.
      Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the
  possible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the
  world's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the
  next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.
      ""The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil's
  attitude, and this compromise could be a solution, "" one said.
      However, the European coffee trade federation meeting,
  which began here today and is to continue to the end of the
  week, has revealed gaps in the European position on
  re-introducing quotas.
      Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against
  re-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in
  favour with the single proviso that there had to be some
  formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing
  countries.
      The roasters said the positions were generally fairly
  close, and problems with some Government officials.
      Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized
  Government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.
      Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota
  re-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour.
      ""Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the
  end of the week to at least present a common European Community
  (EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the
  International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July,"" one trader said.
      ""We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not
  only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,""
  one official said.
      ""We have learned that we can live without the quotas that
  were suspended in February last year, but would prefer the
  stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not
  simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as
  quota allocation is concerned,"" he added.
      Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the
  likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly
  pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.
      ""Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the
  consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota
  re-introduction, "" he said.
      ""The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new
  Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least
  negotiable position of any of his predecessors,"" one trader
  said.
      ""However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of
  the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under
  a new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which
  gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota
  meeting in September,"" the official said.

  Indonesia rejected World Bank
  recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
  the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
  billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
      Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks
  distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
  at The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bank
  for this free trade, open economy view is weak.""
      The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
  largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
  growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.
      The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
  and the subsidies are a waste of money.
      Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
  an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
  needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
  exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
  assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
      Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
  should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
  government would continue to maintain production targets for
  ""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.
      The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
  drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
  the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
  would save money by importing the commodity.
      However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
  to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
  industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
      He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
  agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
  develop and because of ""over-production and price intervention

  U.S. House and Senate budget
  negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached
  yesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending
  on agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.
      The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4
  billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.
      The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the
  farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a
  total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.
      The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture
  committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in
  agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets
  without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior
  Congressional aides told Reuters.
      Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find
  the budget savings.
      Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains
  subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat
  and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs
  and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.
      House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has
  said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.
      But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to
  be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and
  a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said
  freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major
  grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget
  savings Glickman claims.
      Another area where Glickman and other have said budget
  savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,
  ARP, levels for wheat and corn.
      However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand
  within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop
  wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30
  pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most
  commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.
      Congressional sources said the only way to achieve
  significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost
  the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said
  singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as
  unfair to one commodity.
      Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most
  likely to eventually look for budget savings are some
  tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible 
  adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.
      Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion
  but not enough, they said.
      Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture
  committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on
  all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price
  support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the
  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.
      This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau
  Federation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.

      They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference
  presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances
  about price differentials making some of their crudes
  uncompetitive.
      There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that
  OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,
  to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.
      But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price
  differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market
  signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.
      ""All OPEC members can make a good case for changing
  differentials,"" said one analyst with a major oil company. ""But
  at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be ""leave well
  alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.""
      Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw
  sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished
  customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,
  marketing incentives have helped their sales.
      Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by
  means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside
  better priced grades in a ""package.""
      Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least
  for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should
  change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for
  fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At
  its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed
  prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference
  point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985
  when members offered discounts to attract customers.
      OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8
  mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter
  and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend
  or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.
      Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not
  mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr
  target and at most make minimal changes to differentials,
  analysts say.
      The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one
  non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export
  crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.
  Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.
      Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil
  exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say
  only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at
  official prices, with some of the rest included in processing
  or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.
      Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,
  when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to
  pay the new prices.
     Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude
  -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --
  was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.
      In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below
  its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,
  due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has
  risen.
      Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say
  its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.
      But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort
  Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the
  differentials question in Vienna.
      ""It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which
  holds the presidency, raised the issue,"" he said.

  Indonesia rejected World Bank
  recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
  the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
  billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
      Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks
  distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
  at The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bank
  for this free trade, open economy view is weak.""
      The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
  largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
  growth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming.
      The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
  and the subsidies are a waste of money.
      Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
  an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
  needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
  exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
  assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
      Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
  should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
  government would continue to maintain production targets for
  ""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.
      The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
  drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
  the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
  would save money by importing the commodity.
      However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
  to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
  industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
      He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
  agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
  develop and because of ""over-production and price intervention
  in the developed nations.""

  Today's U.K. Economic data have pushed
  the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current
  nine pct further into the distance, analysts said.
      A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing
  production data showed that the economy is still strong and
  does not need a fillip from lower rates.
      News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,
  taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money
  supply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist
  arguments against easier credit, they said.
      ""The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back
  all the while. The strength of the economy and broad money
  growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near
  term,"" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.
      Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's
  mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies
  said were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.
  Rates.
      It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that
  a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such
  optimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise which
  mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling's
  strength.
      The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm
  about May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment
  rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly
  replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying
  average earnings in April, dealers said.
      The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending
  rose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank
  of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset
  the impact on domestic money supply of its current
  intervention.
      ""The gilt market reaction was correct,"" said Bill Martin,
  chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.
      ""That's very important ... It shows the economy in a very
  good state indeed,"" Skeoch said.
      ""There's no reason to get worries about inflationary
  pressures because they're very subdued."" Unit wage cost rises
  were better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to
  April, and it was these costs rather than average earnings
  which were potentially inflationary, he added.
      ""I don't think these average earnings numbers are a major
  problem,"" agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.
      But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried
  about the funding implications of recent intervention.
      He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets
  earlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that
  the ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, now
  looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try
  to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.
      However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson
  Securities, said any fresh sterling strength would still
  trigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signal
  higher inflation this year.
      ""Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As
  long as that continues we're okay,"" he added.

  A spokesman for the European
  Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy
  on oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to help
  alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax.
      Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission's
  Directorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oils
  and Fats Contact Days ""the Commission firmly believes that the
  sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in
  the oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to
  make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem
  within that sector by paying a levy.""
      The proposed tax is necessary because the level of
  budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds
  production has become unacceptable, Tanghe said.
      Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European
  Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0
  billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's ""standstill""
  agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then
  feel the full impact of its enlargement.
      The Commission has proposed several cost and production
  cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum
  guaranteed quantity system, he added.
      Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumer
  prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700
  Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe
  said.
      Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory
  amount when market prices are below or above this level.
      He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory
  amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural
  Policy's oils and fats regime.
      ""The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the
  proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete
  or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,"" he said.
      Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.
      It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied
  to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed
  it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.
      EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do
  under present aid arrangements, he said.
      The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC
  produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities
  imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,
  Tanghe said.
      The proposed system would not alter the EC nations'
  requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall
  effect would stabilise Community production levels without
  affecting demand, he said.
      It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current
  import levels, he said.
      Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are
  imported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and meals
  requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.
  Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported
  beans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.

  The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an
  annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of
  abandoning a rig.
      An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the
  subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible
  from corporation tax payable.
      It would have been a bonus if the company had won but all
  budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he
  said.
      Oil analysts said that RTZ's assumption of liability was
  shared by the industry as a whole.
      The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the
  expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the
  expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were
  built into the accounts, one analyst added.

  The rate of increase in world palm oil
  use is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000
  tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke,
  editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.
      He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that in
  the next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to
  8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year average
  increase of 550,000 tonnes.
       Opening stocks at the start of next October are expected
  to be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlier
  levels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.
      The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnes
  above this season's available amount, Mielke said.
      The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia will
  slow down from this year on, but that will be offset by area
  expansion in Indonesia, he said.
      He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesian
  mature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, and
  at 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.
      Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak,
  where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula,
  but where yields are lower, he said.
       The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is also
  expected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean,
  cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel and
  palm.
      At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils were
  unusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the current
  season's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year ago
  and with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.
      Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the start
  of next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks by
  the end of next season.
      The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks last
  October and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 at
  the end of next season, Mielke said.
      World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in the
  course of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen in
  soybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mln
  tonnes or by one fifth.
      Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S.,
  for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mln
  tonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocks
  of 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of this
  season.

  The European Community (EC) accused the
  United States of violating a political commitment to free trade
  through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a
  customs user fee.
      EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to the
  surveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  (GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters.
      Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in
  criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which
  import licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as to
  improve its balance of payments.
      The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules
  by restricting imports of agricultural products through an
  import licensing system. The United States asked for
  consultations with Tokyo on the issue.
      Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a
  political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers,
  pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September.
      When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to
  negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT
  surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT
  jargon as ""standstill and rollback.""
      Tran criticised Washington for the ""superfund"" tax on oil
  imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special
  machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government
  procurement list for reasons of national security.
      Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the
  policies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.
      The surveillance body will send a record of today's talks
  to the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round,
  to decide any further action on the charges.
      The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the
  subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the
  Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.
      The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel's
  report and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports
  breached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify its
  legislation.

  The West Texas cotton crop was largely

  said.
      ""There might have been some isolated storms, but certainly
  nothing damaging,"" said Charles Stichler, an extension
  agronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far West
  Texas.
      Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the New

     Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95
  cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25
  cents.
      ""What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, and
  when that happens, everybody sees it,"" said Dale Mohler, a
  senior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc.
      Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, which
  produces about 80 pct of that state's crop.
      The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. ""That's hurricane
  force. But they were isolated to just a small portion of the
  West Texas area, probably less than five pct,"" Mohler said.
      ""No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in July

      About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has been

  A trade-led boom in the U.S. is
  unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will
  merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and
  other sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in its
  latest economic report.
      Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,
  after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will
  contribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.
      As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5
  pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,
  the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.
      ""Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop
  dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause
  a falloff in the growth of disposable income,"" Van Dyke said.
      Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8
  pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.
      The report was released before the Commerce Department
  reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,
  after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal
  consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with
  a 0.6 pct increase the month before.
      The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost
  consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9
  pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.
      This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income 
  growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.
      As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power
  of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs
  this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.
      The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing
  starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in
  1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.
      ""For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988
  or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,"" Van Dyke said.
      Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on an
  improvement in trade. ""However, with protectionist attitudes on
  the rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,"" he
  added.

  Brooklyn Union Gas Co, a New York gas
  utility, will see its gas costs up sharply as a result of
  Transco Energy Co's &lt;E> decision to close its pipelines to
  transport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said.
      Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in the
  United States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, or
  non-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spot
  supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,
  analysts said.
      Texas Eastern pipelines &lt;TET>, the other competing
  pipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the South
  closed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union has
  relied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.
       In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrs
  per mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gas
  costs four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said.
      Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open
  access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear
  of accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities.
      Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for
  gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers.
      Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount of
  supplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, a
  Brooklyn Union official said.
      Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said
  most of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed through
  to rate payers.
      While net effect on the company will not be known for
  several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,
  end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,
  will end up paying more for gas, he said.
      Because the closure takes place in summer months when gas
  demand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would be
  small, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson Lufkin
  Jenrette, said.
      If the situation persists into winter heating season, high
  cost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said.
      Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco for
  spot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co &lt;NCNG>,
  Piedmont Natural Gas Co &lt;PNY>, will face the same high cost
  factor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager with
  end users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokering
  firm, said.
      ""But these companies are not unwitting victims of the
  take-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers,"" he said.
      Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's request
  for an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facility
  for spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.
      Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas will
  threaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to
  alternative fuels, he said.
      In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the
  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is being
  negotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said.
      Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas
  for them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory
  on the inventory charge, he said.

  Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended his
  controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S.
  farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they
  approve of the proposal.
      The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per
  bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for
  soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on
  planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs
  for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.
      Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market
  sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting
  nations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the
  first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings
  examining farm programs.
      Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his
  ""Family Farm Act.""
      -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income
  and reduce government spending on agriculture.
      -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not
  ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would
  increase overall revenue from exports.
      This would be done by seeking agreement among major
  exporting countries including the European Community on market
  sharing at agreed high prices.
      Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing
  that such a grain export cartel is not workable.
      -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports
  would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices
  stem more from ""gouging"" by food processing companies than from
  high farm product prices.
      Harkin cited what he termed ""excessive"" net returns on
  equity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pct
  Monfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J.
  Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct
  Quaker Oats.
      -- Harkin said a ""legitimate"" concern about his bill would
  be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.
      He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would
  allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp.
  grain stocks for three years.
      Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a
  ""predictable and stable"" grain price, he said.
      -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm
  participation would be no more ""mandatory"" than the current
  farm program. He said farmers now must participate in farm
  programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect
  farm income.

  semi-annual review of the world economy.
      This view is less favourable than the West German
  government's forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this
  year, but is in line with forecasts by independent economic
  institutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.
      The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year,
  with the gross national product rising by two pct in real
  terms.
      The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing
  through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some
  recovery in business confidence in the near future.
      But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy
  was higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by
  2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986's 3.7 pct.
      While noting that the government is bringing forward a five
  billion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that ""the
  medium to longer-term performance of the West German economy
  could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow
  relatively lower tax rates.""
      Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German Federal
  Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP
  actually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter of
  this year compared with the final three months of 1986.
      Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appeared
  likely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any of
  the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
      West Germany's current account surplus, the target of
  considerable criticism by the Reagan administration, is
  expected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from
  35.8 billion in 1986, before declining to 29 billion dlrs in
  1988.

  France's growth rate is expected to
  strengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first
  half, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation for
  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
      In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECD
  forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
  would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said the
  rate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly
  higher than in the first half of this year.
      The OECD said France's economic situation has deteriorated
  somewhat during the early months of 1987. 
      Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory
  adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation
  has reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to
  reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.
      The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand
  pick up in the second half of this year. But both data are
  likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.
      The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for
  the second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six
  months. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct
  for the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct.

  Italy's economic outlook for 1987 and 1988
  is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly
  lower growth, higher unemployment and an increased trade
  deficit, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
  Development (OECD) said.
      But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast a
  slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Last
  year Italy ranked as one of the OECD's fastest growing
  economies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct.
      The OECD said Italy's GDP may grow by three pct in 1987,
  but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.
      The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five
  pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in
  import prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labour
  costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the report
  said.
      This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demand
  should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption
  made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.
      Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration in
  Italian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports and
  adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result in
  a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account.

"test/18991";"International_Trade";"3";"JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS WILL GROW AGAIN IN 1987, OECD
  Japan's trade surplus is likely to
  continue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroad
  increase while domestic demand remains sluggish, the
  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
  said.
      In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the
  OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last
  year, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while
  export markets rose by only two pct.
      But it said this differential between the growth of
  domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,
  ""thus weakening the international adjustment process.""
      It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two
  pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct
  in 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will
  rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in
  1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.
      The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion
  yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand
  and increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said the
  measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite
  possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have
  worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.
      The OECD outlook said, ""Continued large current account
  surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial
  net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure
  on the yen."" It said that further appreciation could then lead
  manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus
  weaken domestic growth.
      The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely to
  gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pct
  growth. But it said Japan would continue its good performance
  on inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a
  0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.

  U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen if
  the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact,
  according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy
  research groups.
      The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Institute
  of Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross
  border trade would benefit both countries.
      But Cato chairman William Niskanen added ""the two nations'
  generally harmonious trade relations are probably not
  sustainable without a new agreement.""
      The United States and Canada, whose cross-border trade
  totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding
  talks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers
  remaining between their two countries.
      The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both
  sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining
  remained.
      Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties
  could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on
  President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and
  this could hit some Canadian trade practices.
      He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto
  industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral
  free trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts.
      Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to
  a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S.
  exports to Canada.
      A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime
  Minister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and
  enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which
  would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.
      It would also increase the gross national products of both
  countries.
      Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all
  tariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules
  for trade in services and investments, end curbs on government
  procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.

  Economic growth will remain sluggish in
  the Netherlands and Belgium next year and unemployment may
  rise, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
  forecast.
      Belgium's GDP growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year and
  next year, bringing a rise in the number of jobless, the OECD
  said in its semi-annual survey. Belgian inflation could
  stabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surplus
  will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP.
      While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming
  its borrowing requirement, ""it will probably be insufficient to
  check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit,"" the OECD said.
      In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5
  pct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becoming
  less competitive and imports rising. ""Employment is forecast to
  decelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in the
  private sector and budgetary cuts,"" the report said.
      Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987
  and stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of declining
  domestic gas prices.
      Luxembourg's economy, by contrast, will see slightly faster
  growth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in

  Strong growth in domestic demand was a key
  feature of the economies of southern European countries in
  1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the
  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.
      In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's total
  domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to
  five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth
  restrained private consumption.
      Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and
  domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected
  to be halved to five pct next year.
      In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment,
  had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross
  Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption
  were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain
  strong.
      The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply
  next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European
  Community and declining competitiveness.
      In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards
  following an increase early this year linked with the
  introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due
  to cold weather.

  High wage settlements in Nordic countries
  threaten to cut exports and reduce the international
  competitiveness of their industries, the Organisation for

      In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded in
  early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration
  in competitiveness. Sweden's competitive position was also seen
  at risk from accelerating wages.
      The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come under
  pressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well as
  Norway, Sweden and Finland.
      Overall economic growth will vary in the different
  countries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual report
  said.
      After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domestic
  demand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one
  pct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see a
  slump in domestic demand. The report said growth in Gross
  Domestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly in
  Sweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmark
  and Norway.
      Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic
  strategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained

  The United States should take urgent
  action to cut its crippling budget deficit, including possible
  reductions in non-defense spending, higher taxes and curbs on
  growth of the defense budget, the Organization for Economic
  Cooperation and Development said.
      The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy,
  said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress
  quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit ""could seriously
  affect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere.""
      It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987,
  running until September 30 this year, would substantially
  overshoot both the Balanced Budget Act's target of 144 billion
  dlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion.
      ""The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions of
  slower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for the
  first half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190
  billion dollars,"" it said.
      While this would be 30 billion lower than last year's
  deficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax
  increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect.
      The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to
  2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last.
      In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exports
  boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth.
      Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service
  sector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to be
  heading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumer
  prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct next
  year after just 2.1 pct in 1986.
      ""Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors
  behind the avoidance of recession,"" the report said.
      The current account balance of payments deficit is expected
  to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, after
  hitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.
      In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly
  to around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but will
  still be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation is
  expected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year,
  unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pct
  this year.
      Canada's current account deficit is projected to shrink to
  around four billion U.S. Dlrs this year and to remain at about
  that level in 1988.

  Prospects for world economic growth remain
  very sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments is
  urgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilize
  currencies and encourage investment, the Organization for
  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.
      ""The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months,
  and ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments
  imbalances are likely to persist,"" it said in one of its
  gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.
      The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of
  western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only
  2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's
  2.5 pct growth rate.
      ""We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area
  comfortably exceeding three pct,"" David Henderson, head of the
  OECD's economics and statistics department, said.
      The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising
  inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S.,
  Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world
  debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic
  downturn.
      ""At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth
  remain favorable,"" it said, citing low inflation in most major
  countries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest
  rates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible
  labor markets.
      But private sector confidence had been undermined by
  uncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that ""for
  confidence to be restored, it is important for governments
  swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments.""
      This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accord
  of the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.
      The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major
  countries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to
  undermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal
  policies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demand
  in the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.
      Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced
  recently by the Japanese government to encourage public works
  and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this
  process, though it was too early to estimate its precise
  impact.
      He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domestic
  demand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.
      The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has
  worsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecast
  to rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct
  increase in 1986.
      There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the
  unemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the
  average rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last
  year.
      The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world
  agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from
  price guarantees and other measures linked to production
  towards direct income support for farmers.

  Domestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pct

  helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand
  following tax cuts and higher real wages, it added.
      The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumer
  prices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988.
      The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly
  and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.
      While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year,
  however, the report revises downwards the OECD's earlier growth
  forecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct.
      The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic
  growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which is

  Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax

  in the budget deficit in the late 1980s.
      ""Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,""
  Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.
      Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs
  in the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he
  forecast in the February budget.
      And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was
  expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32
  billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.
      Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year
  higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income
  support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated
  revenues.
      But finance department documents show the pace of deficit
  reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and
  1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the
  transition to the reformed taxation system.
      The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in
  fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1
  billion dlrs in 1991.
      Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian

  Recent government moves to curb capital
  inflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan's
  foreign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollar
  against the U.S. Currency, officials and bankers said.
      Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the
  reserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past two
  weeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against the
  U.S. Dollar.
      Chang said, ""The pace of increase in our reserves is much
  slower now than before and our currency is getting more stable.""
  He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surplus
  with the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S.
  Dlrs a month between January and May.
      The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and
  West Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs.
      On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings of
  local and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bank
  purchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90
  pct of the value of a contract.
      Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures had
  drastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange to
  importers and exporters.
      They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollar
  transactions showed a drastic decline with some banks
  registering a fall of up to 30 pct.
      Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised against
  the U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanese
  cents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of five
  to eight cents in May.
      The bank dealers said the central bank, which had
  previously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1
  billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercial
  demand.
      They said they expected the government to keep the local
  dollar stable in the near term to give breathing space to
  businesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise of
  more than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar since
  September 1985.
      The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today,
  unchanged from yesterday.
      Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said,
  ""It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflow
  is quite successful.""
      Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slower
  rise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure from
  Washington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan.
      Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayed
  imports of machinery and production equipment because of
  exchange rate uncertainty, he said. The stable exchange rate
  would help boost imports, particularly from the United States.

  The government should cut its consumer
  rice price if the official producer price is reduced next
  month, Tetsuo Kondo, director general of the government's
  Economic Planning Agency (EPA), told reporters.
      Kondo said after a cabinet meeting that consumers should
  receive the benefits of the falling costs of rice farming due
  to the strong yen and lower oil prices.
      Agriculture Ministry sources said the producer rice price
  paid to rice farmers would be cut after discussions by the Rice
  Price Council, an advisory body to the ministry, on July 1 and
  2. The consumer rice price is usually set in December.

  Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the
  value of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. And
  other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, an
  advisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency
  (EPA) said.
      The advisory body said in its report that the yen would
  soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global
  basis were delayed.
      An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall to
  slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed to
  restructure their economies.
      The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cut
  Japan's current account surplus to two pct of gross national
  product (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a change
  would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually
  during the seven-year period to 1993.
      If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar
  would remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan's
  current-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. This
  scenario put Japan's GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year.
      It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy
  and four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.

  Ceylon Petroleum Corp (CPC) has decided
  to renew its one-year contract with Abu Dhabi for 480,000
  tonnes of Upper Zakum crude oil, CPC officials told Reuters.
      They said CPC made the recommendation to the cabinet and is
  now awaiting its approval.
      CPC's one-year contract with Abu Dhabi expired on May 31
  this year and it wants the renewed contract to begin on June 1
  at the government selling price. Delivery will be determined in
  the course of the year. Last year, shipments were in three
  parcels of 120,000 tonnes each and four of 30,000 tonnes each.
      CPC officials also said the company agreed with the
  Egyptian government for the supply of 240,000 tonnes of Gulf of
  Suez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the
  government selling price.
      Last year, CPC bought 120,000 tonnes Gulf of Suez through
  C.Itoh.
      Officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of Basra Light
  from Iraq have not been finalised yet because of several
  constraints. CPC said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcels
  and proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments.
      Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where
  lifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOC
  then proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each.
      CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for
  delivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo to
  offload CPC's needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable.
      CPC said it had not received a reply from INOC since
  December. Sri Lanka imports all its annual needs of 1.7 mln
  tonnes. This year it plans to buy 400,000 tonnes on the spot
  market compared with about 1.3 mln tonnes last year.

  South Africa recorded annualised
  real growth in GDP of 3.25 pct in the first quarter of this
  year and the economy should achieve the government's target of
  three pct growth for 1987, the Reserve Bank said.
      The South African central bank said in its quarterly
  bulletin that confidence in the economy improved from January
  to May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in the
  nation's gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement
  in the rand's exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents.
      It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in the
  third and fourth quarters of last year.
      It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreement
  reached with international creditors in March as evidence of
  improved foreign perceptions of the South African economy.
      The accord effectively extends a moratorium on most
  repayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's short term
  foreign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs.
      South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised
  surplus on the current account of the balance of payments of
  7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplus
  of 7.24 billion rand in 1986. The bank said it was the ninth

  U.S. Exports of edible
  groundnuts could fall to 185,000 tonnes in the year to
  September 1987 from 248,000 in the same 1986 period, trading
  company Tracomin SA said.
      It revised its December 1986 forecast that exports would

  Market share in the two main importing countries, Britain and
  the Netherlands, and the sale of nuts intended for export at a

      Tracomin estimated export availability from the 1986 crop

      Tracomin said it expects a good 1987 U.S. Groundnut crop
  and forecast a resurgence in U.S. Exports next year.
      ""Barring any market manipulations, a good U.S. Harvest in
  1987 could lead to attractive prices, active trading and the

  Proven oil and gas deposits in Saudi
  Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according
  to the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco.
      Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167
  billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985,
  while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft
  from 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said.
      Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about
  200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi
  Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per
  day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.
  
      Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as
  OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture
  their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed
  from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the
  organisation decided to cut production again from last
  September onwards.
      Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.
      Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly
  to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the
  official Saudi Press Agency.
      The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the
  number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.
  
      Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44
  mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was
  upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling
  it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the
  report said.
      The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned by
  another state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- produced
  around 750,000 bpd last year.
  
      Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from
  998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began
  operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes
  per day, the report said.
      Aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4
  billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs.

  OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman
  said he expects next week's ministerial meeting in Vienna to be

      ""I expect the meeting in Vienna to be short and calm,""
  Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, told reporters here
  ahead of his departure on Sunday for the conference, which
  starts June 25.
      ""We already have an agreement which may need only a slight

      The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministers
  in December last year pegged the group's crude oil output at
  15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18
  dlrs a barrel.
      Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December to
  just above the official OPEC levels, with oil industry analysts
  firmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreement
  to keep the market stable.
      ""I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position to
  strengthen the gains we have made so far,"" Lukman said.
      He declined to say if the current ceiling should be
  maintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and
  18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December.
      ""Whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by our

      He said non-OPEC member Norway, which he visited two weeks

      Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchwey
  made the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnes
  of rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aid
  programme.
      The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, follows

      Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growing
  areas throughout the south this year. The Ministry of

  major staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.
      GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequences
  of current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the drought
  experiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps to
  alleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.
      The failure of seasonal rains has already seriously

      In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool with

      In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, it

  continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work
  impossible.
      In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was

  U.S. crude oil prices are at their
  highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC
  meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any
  policy changes from the session.
      They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the
  organization's accord in December, have risen on technical
  factors within the market and concerns about supplies because
  of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the
  Gulf.
      The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading
  around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile
  Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its
  highest level since January 1986.
      OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's
  oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to
  be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production
  agreement may only need a slight review.
      Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation
  of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to
  a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.
      Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon
  after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased
  tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices
  should begin easing.
      ""OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed
  to in December because oil prices are firm,"" said John Hill, a
  vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.
      OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at
  18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to
  16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln
  barrels in the fourth quarter.
      This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising
  from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.
      Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,
  Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a
  reduction in output.
      ""And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to
  trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that
  OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,"" said Nauman
  Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.
      But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such
  as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.
      ""The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the
  official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are
  committed to stabilizing the market,"" said Rosario Ilacqua,
  analyst with L.F. Rothschild.
      However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting
  in September to re-evaluate market conditions.
      Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the
  fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a
  day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000
  barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president
  of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.
      Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this
  meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to
  offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated
  throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,
  producers receive less money for their oil.
      ""The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,""
  said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.
      ""In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to
  produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act
  as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two
  dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,"" he
  said.
      One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.
      ""The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian
  Gulf,"" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache
  Securites.
      Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been
  regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration
  is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the
  U.S. flag, with naval escorts.
      ""Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis
  like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that
  could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,"" Knuettel said.

  Unocal Corp said it told the U.S.
  Treasury Department that it will not include fluidized bed
  combustion technology, a method for the more efficient burning
  of solids, at its Parachute Creek oil shale project in Colorado
  due to high costs.
      Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic
  Fuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology at
  the oil shale plant. In return the company would have been
  eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports
  from the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contract
  from the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.
      Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized
  bed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs,
  compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.
      The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and
  electricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said.
      Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment
  tax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the project
  uneconomical even with government price supports and loan
  guarantees, Unocal said.
      The Parachute Creek oil shale plant produces about 4,000 to

  European coffee roasters and traders
  have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating
  International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee
  Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.
      Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee
  Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.
      The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and
  would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an
  unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current
  coffee agreement, van Horick said.
      If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the
  ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new
  agreement, van Horick said.
      Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when
  prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in
  Brazil.
      Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and
  producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.
      ""Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the
  formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal
  leaves it very little to object to,"" van Horick said.
      ""The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not
  reflect supply and demand reality,"" he said. ""Our formula
  builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost
  everyone.""
      Although full implications of the new formula have still to
  be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as
  Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly
  higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El
  Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.
      Because the proposal provides that future quota
  distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it
  should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing
  so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.
      ""If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least
  a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the
  September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a
  new quota formula, "" van Horick said.
      At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.
      ""Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If
  there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two
  months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might
  just get an agreement,"" van Horick added.

  Malaysia is to urge fellow tin
  producing countries to contribute more money towards research
  into new uses for the metal, Malaysian primary industries
  minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in an interview.
      Lim, in Brussels on a tour of Europe and America, said he
  had instructed Malaysia's representatives on the executive
  committee of the Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC,
  to draw up a paper on the matter.
      Lim earlier met European Community farm commissioner Frans
  Andriessen and industry commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes.
      He said though it now appeared likely Commission proposals
  for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be
  defeated, he feared the Commission would revive the idea.
      Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax was
  adopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result,
  they would be compensated through access to the EC for
  alternative exports.
      ""Since most of our products are commodity based, I cannot
  see how this would work out in our case,"" Lim said.
      Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250
  mln dlrs a year.
      The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPC
  meeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September.
      ""Not enough research and development effort has been put in
  by tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutes
  such as aluminium, paper and plastics,"" Lim said.
      He mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as an
  exciting possible new application.
      Lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra money
  which needed to be spent on research into new uses before the
  new paper was produced.
      He said Narjes told him there appeared no fundamental
  barriers to EC states quickly ratifying the new International
  Rubber Agreement, INRA, although translations of the accord
  into some EC languages are still being awaited.
      Lim, who will sign and ratify the agreement on Malaysia's
  behalf when he visits New York during his current tour, said it
  was important there should not be a long ""interregnum"" between
  the old agreement lapsing in October and the new one coming
  into force.
      He described the present accord as a model for commodity
  agreements due to its being signed by nearly all producing and
  consuming countries and by virtue of its review systems and
  control over buffer stock management.

  A group of Latin American and
  Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in
  Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development
  and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.
      Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of
  American States special committee on trade, said he was aware
  of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added ""the region should
  not be the one affected by the trade bills.""
      He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar
  and the budget deficit, and ""it is regrettable to solve it by a
  trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests.""
      Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two
  days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in
  Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit,
  which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.
      Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at
  Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large,
  annual trade surpluses with the United States.
      Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations
  with large trade surpluses last year with the United States,
  but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2
  billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs.
      The European Community has also opposed the bills.
      Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the
  Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in
  the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require
  retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.
      He told reporters the committee would likely mount a
  campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate
  on the Senate floor, expected next week.
      Rodriguez said ""the region needs trade to continue
  development.  We hope this need will not be affected negatively
  by trade legislation.""
      Rodriguez said: ""we need to keep the market opens -
  especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign
  exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue
  national development progress.""
      President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he
  termed ""protectionist,"" and his aides now are mounting a effort
  to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the
  legislation.
      Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez
  said as yet ""the administration is not in a veto frame of mind.""

  A U.S. government trade official
  responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on
  coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombian
  efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers.
      Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative just
  back from trade talks in Colombia, said most producing
  countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be
  agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.
      ""There is one country which evidently still does not,""
  Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which has
  been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas.
      Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook
  for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September
  International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict.
      He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical
  discussions with Colombian officials.
      While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of the
  Colombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe,
  Cardenas left a ""positive letter,"" Rosenbaum said.
      The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last month
  which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula
  for the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concerns
  with the technical details of the Colombian plan.
      Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment
  on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by
  European coffee roasters and traders.
      Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick
  said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving
  averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for
  the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement.
      The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas
  unless ""objective criteria"" which reflect recent changes in the
  coffee market are used to set export limits.

  The United States said Kuwait was

      State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, who made the
  disclosure about the tankers, also told reporters the United
  States expects to conclude very soon a favorable arrangement
  with Saudi Arabia concerning expanded security cooperation in
  the Gulf. The two developments occur as the Reagan
  administration continued to come under fire in Congress for its
  plans to bring 11 Kuwaiti tankers under American flags.
      The move is designed to protect the tankers from Iranian
  attacks and ensure freedom of navigation in the strategic
  waterway but has raised fears on Capitol Hill that it will draw
  the United States into the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq War.
      ""The Kuwaitis have discussed the possibility of chartering
  U.S. flag vessels with the Maritime Administration,"" Oakley
  said. She emphasized, however, that ""if some charter arrangement
  could be worked out, it would not supplant the reflagging
  arrangement that we worked out with the Kuwaitis.""
      In both cases, the ships would be eligible for U.S. Navy

  The Administration asked Congress to

  Representative Clayton Yeutter said.
      The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more
  accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when
  the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.
      Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is

  Italy's Foreign Trade Minister Mario
  Sarcinelli, commenting on speculation in the Italian press,
  said a sharp balance of payments deficit in May could not be
  attributed to recent moves liberalizing the purchase of foreign
  securities.
      Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month's
  overall 3,211 billion lire deficit, which compares with April's
  2,040 billion surplus, could be linked to a May 13 decree
  abolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreign
  securities purchases.
     ""The deficit can be better attributed to premature and
  delayed foreign trade payments and receipts (leads and lags)
  rather than capital outflow to portfolio investment,"" Sarcinelli
  said in a statement.
      Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks by
  the Bank of Italy, which announced the deficit for May and said
  it had been partly caused by ""non-banking capital outflows.""
      ""In practice, it seems that there has been a constant flow
  of capital to foreign securities or investments outside our
  borders,"" said the newspaper.

  Tenneco Inc said Tennessee Gas Pipeline
  Co, its largest interstate natural gas pipeline, will transport
  natural gas under the open access rules of the Federal Energy
  Regulatory Commission, FERC.
      In open access, gas pipelines serve purely as a transport
  company, moving gas from suppliers to customers. Pipelines also
  transport its own gas to customers.
      Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co &lt;T> rejected the FERC
  guidelines, saying it would not offer open access until the
  regulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces for
  gas it has bought but could not sell.
      The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or pay
  contracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-term
  contracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe as
  customers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access.
      Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that
  Tenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines to
  open-access because of the take-or-pay issue.
      But Tenneco today said open access ""is one of the steps
  FERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERC
  is moving the industry through this restructuring now, even
  before all transitional problems are solved.""

  The economy faces lackluster growth
  and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement
  in U.S. exports should falter, economists say.
      Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness
  in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further
  hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.
      ""These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength
  to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?"" said Lyle
  Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers
  Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official.
      The Commerce Department said this week that the economy
  grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but
  a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.
      Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending
  rose a weak 0.1 per cent.
      ""Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --
  are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, ""
  Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,
  told Reuters.
      Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow
  because inflation is rising faster than real wages.
      To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,
  returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost
  personal income and consumption, he says.
      ""I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to
  keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,""
  Gramley said.
      Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters
  that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the
  result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last
  and said the recovery was showing anemia.
      Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, ""The pace
  of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into
  monetary policy"" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be
  accommodative.
      Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct
  forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if
  the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add
  to the risk of a recession.
      Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May
  came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an
  inventory overhang still exists.
      He says the boost in production came from smaller
  industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have
  improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.
      ""They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in
  economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a
  recession,"" Mauro said.
      In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl
  Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the
  trade deficit will continue to improve.
      ""Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and
  into 1988 are still quite favorable,"" he said.
      But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in
  inflation.
      Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers
  Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5
  to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after
  a 1.1 pct increase in 1986.
      The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil
  and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.
      ""The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets
  out of the bottle, it continues to persist,"" he said, adding he
  would like the Fed to tighten credit.
      A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the
  dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says
  a prominent international banker.
      Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National
  Press Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and
  the mark will continue for years because the United States is
  the world's largest debtor nation.
      The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a
  further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that
  the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever.

  OPEC has shown itself to be in control
  of the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a
  pact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day
  (bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said.
      They said market respect for the cartel has increased since
  it announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output
  to 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December.
      ""There are light oversupplies now, but OPEC ... Has ensured
  there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is in
  effect putting pressure on end-users,"" a European crude oil
  trader said.
      In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, ""There's no reason to expect
  a weak market from now on.""
      A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, ""We
  thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter
  production so the market will react very bullishly.""
      Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a
  slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmark
  crude, they expect price increases over the next few days.
      August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at
  around 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but still
  below the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.
      Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and Abu
  Dhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weak
  positions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traders
  said sellers might now aim for GSP's at least.
      They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices to
  stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.
      They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected
  and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter
  requirements before October.
      Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on
  European and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.
      ""There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production
  by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high,"" said an
  international trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was less
  bullish, ""For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on
  how much they (OPEC members) cheat.""
      A Singapore trade source said, ""There is enough cheating and
  leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is
  no need to worry about shortages.""
      Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level,
  after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearish
  factor to be considered.
      Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as
  possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market
  cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement.
      Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in
  thin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillates
  quiet on minimal buying interest.
      Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and
  tight prompt supplies, dealers said.

  OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6
  mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost
  spot prices and enable the group to raise its official
  reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current
  18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.
      ""Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the
  official price will be 20 dlrs in January,"" a Japanese refiner
  said.
      The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC
  members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and
  Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.
      Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as
  the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987
  output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs
  for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for
  U.K. Brent, traders said.
      They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into
  the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate
  (WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.
      ""With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import
  Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those
  grades further,"" said a Japanese oil trader.
      Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot
  market has further upward potential in the short term, having
  risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.
      ""You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that
  basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today,"" said
  one international oil trader in Tokyo.
      ""But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought
  back up again pretty quickly,"" he added.
      One oil industry analyst concurred, ""There is no reason to
  expect a weak market from now on."" He said he expected OPEC to
  raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.
      Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly
  in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and
  the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to
  maintain steady prices.
      Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day
  compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its
  export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline
  through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.
      Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,
  against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up
  to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.
      Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating
  on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price
  discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But
  they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as
  swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher
  output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise
  too high too fast.
      Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln
  barrels. ""Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the
  stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises
  too much,"" an oil industry analyst said.

  The acting governor of Saudi Arabia's
  state-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, has
  retired at his own request, oil industry sources said.
      They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation
  planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.
      Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher,
  left in a major oil industry shake up last December.
      The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the
  post permanently.
      The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki
  Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry
  sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil
  market.
      The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20
  years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi
  Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned
  to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.
      Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an
  OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel
  last December.
      Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations
  which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia
  does business, the sources said.
      The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's

  Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback in
  planned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15
  until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle
  told Reuters.
      ""We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna,""
  he said. ""The accord reached there means stability in the oil
  market and we shall continue making our contribution.""
      The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, would
  probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Helle
  said. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and
  would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.
      OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of
  16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and
  retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord
  based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.
      OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and
  it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter
  ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth
  quarter.
      Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore
  fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from
  planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained
  within its December accord on output and prices.
      Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around
  840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln
  bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.
      The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since
  February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.
      Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for
  a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement
  on the latest oil production cutbacks.
      Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC
  producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia
  and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep
  prices stable.
      Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an
  OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around
  18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.
      Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export
  earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price
  during the first half of 1986.
      But firmer oil prices since then have brought some
  stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade
  deficit.
       Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently
  refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to
  the producing oil companies to set the levels of production.

  Belgium, current holder of the European

  package, diplomats said.
      In a discussion document prepared for today's summit
  meeting of EC leaders, Belgium proposed the so-called
  ""stabilising mechanism"" be the subject of ""further study and
  consultation with the Community's main trading partners.""
      The proposal for a tax of as much as 330 Ecus per tonne on
  both imported and domestically-produced vegetable and marine
  oils and fats has attracted a storm of international criticism.
      The discussion document, aimed at preventing a cash row at

  measure.
      Britain and Denmark, which assumes the EC presidency on
  June 30, have led the opposition to the measure. They are
  supported by West Germany and the Netherlands and, to a lesser
  extent, Spain.
      Although the paper was not universally welcomed, diplomats
  said, the proposal to postpone consideration of the tax for a

  Bangladesh's trade gap is expected to
  widen in fiscal 1987/88 beginning on July 1 after the
  government relaxed restrictions on some imports including
  luxury cars.
      The country has set its export target for the year at 1.1
  billion U.S. Dlrs against imports of 1.805 billion dlrs,
  compared with 1986/7's one billion dlrs of export earnings and
  1.113 billion dlrs of imports.
      Commerce Minister Mohammad Abdul Munim said the changes
  were aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boost
  foreign exchange earnings and imports of essential machinery
  and raw materials, to increase industrial production.
      The government was easing procedures to enhance incentives
  especially for exporters of textiles and frozen food and
  importers of industrial machinery and raw materials, Munim told
  reporters.
      Commerce Ministry officials told Reuters the import policy
  covered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billion
  dlrs. Imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by the
  government were not included in the policy, they added.
      They said the country's total import bill (both commercial
  and other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs in
  the new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87.
      The minister said ending restrictions on imports of cars
  and dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm the
  economy.
      Munim said Bangladesh feared a further drop in prices for
  its main export jute, ""which will certainly affect our export
  earnings"" in the coming year.
      Bangladesh's jute exports fell to 410 mln dlrs from 500 mln
  in 1986/87, according official figures.
      But Munim said exports of non-traditional items, which
  accounted for over 40 pct of total exports this year, would
  play a key role in achieving the 1987/88 export target.

  OPEC output for the second half of 1987,
  including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln
  barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday,
  Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said.
      Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its
  ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters
  of 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter
  level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter
  target.
      Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, ""OPEC third
  quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while
  fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd""
      Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production
  levels would have on prices.
      Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,
  rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to
  adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln
  barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia
  and Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when
  a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about
  September.
      Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War
  enemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369
  mln in the second half.
      Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from
  the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has
  been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. ""We will
  not discuss it. There will not be any change,"" he said.
      Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended
  Saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems
  to be adressed. ""We are overdoing it in holding too short a
  meeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet,"" he said.
      Ali said the problem of price differentials between the
  prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly
  at the meeting.
  
      Ali said ""The problem of differentials is a real one. I
  would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem
  has not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced
  relative to heavy crudes.""
      Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the
  next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said
  ""If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do
  the work of another minister.""
      Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades.
      OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spread
  of 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes.

  production quota set in Vienna for the second half of this
  year, the official Iraqi news agency INA reported.
      It quoted Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, who
  returned Sunday, as saying ""Iraq will continue to adhere to its
  position considering itself as not included in the agreement.""
  
      Last December, Iraq rejected its assigned first half 1987
  quota of 1.466 mln bpd and demanded a share equal to the 2.255
  mln bpd quota set for Iran, its enemy in the nearly
  seven-year-old Gulf war.
      The accord reached by OPEC ministers in Vienna Saturday set
  an output ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd for the group's 13 members
  from July to December, raising Iraq's share to 1.54 mln bpd and
  Iran's to 2.369 mln.

  Ivory Coast rainfall this season has
  been less than in previous years, but 1986/87 cocoa and coffee
  production has not suffered, the official Ivorian daily
  Fraternite Matin reported.
      The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dry
  conditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop.
  Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant if
  there is good rainfall in coming weeks.
      Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowest
  in northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop has
  especially benefitted from the dry weather, Fraternite Matin
  said.
      Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said earlier this
  month 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213,506 tonnes,
  compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86.
      Fraternite Matin said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculture
  had been little affected by the dry weather. Coffee does not
  need very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants have
  been affected in some regions, it added.
      London-based dealer Gill and Duffus recently forecast
  1986/87 Ivory Coast cocoa output at a record 590,000 tonnes,
  which compares with 585,000 estimated for 1985/86. It described
  early development of the new main crop as patchy.
      The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) earlier this year
  forecast a drop in 1986/87 coffee production in the Ivory Coast
  due to drought in the western part of the country. It estimated
  the crop at 3.84 mln bags compared with the previous year's
  4.33 mln bag harvest.
      Ivorian officials have only described this year's coffee
  crop as ""normal.""

  The Reserve Bank of India, RBI,
  announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use
  foreign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm's total annual
  export earnings for export promotion abroad.
      The move is designed by the government to improve India's
  trade deficit.
      Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit
  Scheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various
  textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and
  electronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports
  goods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.
      The scheme replaces current rules which allow different
  amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a
  minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.
      RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products will
  qualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional
  spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value
  of annual export earnings.
      These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and
  semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil,
  psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.
      RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the
  two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their
  freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.
      Industry sources said the new entitlements, considerably
  higher than the previous limits, are also more flexible because
  holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to
  RBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes.

  U.S. moves to increase its warships in
  and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on
  unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a
  direct military clash with Iran, diplomats said.
      They said the American decision inevitably carries some
  risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt
  rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.
      ""As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the
  Gulf could do serious damage,"" said one western diplomat.
      Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks
  on ""soft targets"" such as merchant shipping not protected by
  American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.
      The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil
  tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated
  by diplomats as low. However, ""There is the threat that the
  Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,
  will go for softer targets,"" one diplomat said.
      Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar
  Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was
  ""moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.""
      The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10
  warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to
  patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.
      The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting
  Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered
  to fly the American flag to give them naval protection.
      Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by
  Iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.
      Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by
  Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is
  preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.
      The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to
  make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.
      A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a
  launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the
  Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.
      ""But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti
  territory would be a very serious escalation"" likely moving
  world opinion against Iran, remarked one.
      Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying
  out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.
      Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted
  last Friday ""a river of blood"" throughout the world in the event
  of any U.S. strike against Iran.
      Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused
  of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable
  capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.
      Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that
  most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to
  pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential
  trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.
      Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or
  other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.

  Weekend rain over the Western Corn Belt
  brought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlier
  this month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcome
  moisture to central and eastern belt locations this week,
  according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-Weather
  Inc.
      ""There is going to be more rain for the next two, three
  days,"" he said. ""We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal to
  above normal moisture this week.""
      Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern
  Minnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in eastern
  Nebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.
      Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but
  were receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.
      Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with
  thudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.
      ""Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, a
  pretty good rain,"" Mohler said.
      Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparking
  an early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of
  Trade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off
  19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.
      Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is
  expected to move over the central Midwest, then move north
  later in the week. That could bring new rain patterns across
  the Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions as
  early-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage
  in early July, he said.

  A North Sea oil find announced by Chevron
  Corp's &lt;CHV> Chevron Exploration North Sea Ltd may indicate a
  new field with recoverable crude oil reserves of 300 mln
  barrels, industry analysts said.
      Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K.
  Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 API
  crude oil from the tertiary ""Alba"" sand through a three-inch
  surface choke.
      ""The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320
  mln barrels,"" Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson
  and Co told Reuters.
      He said industry estimates put the total reserves at the
  field at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity of
  oil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25
  pct.
      Analysts said the results were encouraging, but the
  potential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in the
  field was shown by the fact that the first well had to be
  plugged and a sidetrack drilled.
      ""The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which will
  require a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costs
  up,"" Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said.
      Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil
  found would require additional costs in recovery, the test well
  showed that it flows well.
      ""Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low,
  it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could be
  recovered,"" Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told Reuters.
      However, Chevron officials declined to comment on the
  analysts' reserve estimates. They said that without further
  research and drilling in the area this summer, they would not
  disclose any reserve figures.
      Analysts said that if the field were declared commercial
  and developed, there would be a ready local market for the
  heavy crude it produced.
      ""Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils and
  the price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a
  lot narrower today,"" Osborne said.
      Chevron operates the block on behalf of 16 companies which
  include British Petroleum Development Ltd, DSM Hydrocarbons
  (UK) Ltd, Enterprise Oil (TNS) Ltd, Marathon Int. Pet. (GB) Ltd

      Ecuador plans to produce 280,000 bpd in August, rising to

  Minister Manuel Azpur UA said.
      Azpur told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the
  measure is ""fundamental to conserving the economic and financial
  strength of the petroleum industry.""
       He said the new exchange rate, which goes before the
  central bank for final approval tommorrow, will allow the state

  problem of working capital and implement investment plans,
  estimated at 20 billion bolivars for 1987. He did not say when

     Venezuela's oil industry previously sold its dollar earnings
  to the government at 7.50 to the dollar but bought foreign
  exchange from its imports at 14.50 bolivars.
     The new exchange rate will promote purchases of domestic
  goods and services by the industry, Azpur said. He added that
  it would also put PDVSA in a position to purchase more

  Sales of new single-family homes
  tumbled 14.9 pct in May from April levels because of higher

      ""There should be another month or two of very weak new home
  sales but with interest rates stabilizing, sale of new homes
  should become more stable by mid-summer,"" said economist
  Lawrence Chimerine of Wharton Econometrics Inc.
      The drop in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
  616,000 units, was the largest since January 1982, the Commerce
  Department said.
      Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out at
  about 9.08 pct in March and rose to about 10.7 pct in April,
  according to Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley.
      The effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers out
  of the market, he and others said.
      ""The rates moved very suddenly and were certainly
  unexpected by homebuyers,"" said Cynthia Latta, an economist
  with Data Resources. ""They were so startled, they wanted to
  hold back and see what would happen.""

  sharper than expected, some economists said. ""We fully expected
  a decline but the extent was more than we anticipated,"" said
  James Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings
  Institutions.
      Christian said there was a sharp rise in May in sales of
  existing homes, which are generally less expensive than new
  homes.
      Latta of Data Resources said strong sales of new
  condominiums in the Northeast and on the West Coast were
  reflected in sales of existing but not new homes.
      Christian of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions said,
  ""Underlying housing demand remains strong. I think the market
  is going to stabilize and give us a good second half.""
      Others were less optimistic, however.
      ""We clearly won't have a boom (in new home sales) but I
  don't think this is the start of a collapse in single-family
  housing,"" said Chimerine of Wharton.
      Eugene Sherman, chief economist of the Federal Home Loan
  Bank of New York, said, ""The lower sales level will be

      Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerce
  seminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S.
  were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel's total
  exports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billion
  dlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total.
      ""I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reach
  five billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn to
  function in the American marketplace and place greater emphasis
  on product quality,"" Yaacobi said.
      While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis European
  currencies is a ""bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,""
  Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trend
  toward higher U.S. exports.
      In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rose
  fivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, while
  imports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year.
      Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct
  annually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
       He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passed
  last year and eliminating all duties and other commercial
  restrictions between the two nations through 1994, would
  continue to facilitate the desired export growth.
      Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act as
  an economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S.
  firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentage
  of the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa.
      Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle
  east was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been able
  to achieve its economic potential.
      Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs in
  aid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing
  military conflicts ""which were imposed on Israel,"" he said.
      Short of achieving Israel's full growth potential, however,
  Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic
  independence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption that
  exports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period.

  Pakistani government allowed freer
  cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed
  at narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.
      Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a
  televised speech the government had also decided to allow
  duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry
  more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of
  Pakistani products.
     
      Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have
  been handled exclusively by state corporations since early
  1970s.
      But Haq said now the private sector would also export
  cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a
  long-standing demand of the local traders.
      The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to
  bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries
  compete effectively in the world market, he said.
     
      Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year
  1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but
  reviewed every year.
      It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing
  trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would
  enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a
  longer period.
      He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided
  for the export of engineering goods to selected third world
  countries on soft credit terms.
     
      Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per
  cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23
  billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.
      He said the government policy was to rationalise and
  streamline import controls.
      ""It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,
  specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local
  industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs,"" he
  said. ""Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods
  produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise
  to smuggling and hampering of exports.""
     
      He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed
  from import restrictions.
      Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from
  remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the
  Gulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the
  drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a
  balance of payments crisis for Pakistan.

  Prospects appear slim for a summer
  meeting between U.S. and Soviet officials before the two
  countries enter the final year of their bilateral grains
  agreement, Agriculture Department officials said.
      The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the
  agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up
  to last February. However, any delay this year should not
  endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends
  through September, 1988, USDA officials said.
      ""It will be difficult to pull together the people for the
  meeting during July,"" an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel
  Amstutz said.
      Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, the
  next talks could still be a ""couple more months,"" he said.
     
      There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA
  will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next
  marketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultations
  were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made.
      ""I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer
  or before the next agreement year begins,"" a USDA source said.
      Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next
  year's crops, he said, ""There are too many variables now. It
  would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now.""
      Under the nonbinding pact, Moscow has agreed to purchase a
  minimum of nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain per year. Soviet and
  U.S. officials normally meet in the summer before the start of
  a new agreement year to discuss grain quality, shipping
  logistics and production outlooks.

  World oil prices would remain stable
  despite the U.S. Attack against Iranian oil platforms and

  Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.
      He described the situation as ""extremely tense,"" but said
  Gulf military activity would not significantly affect prices
  because supply and demand were roughly equal.
      Demand for OPEC crude in the final quarter of 1987 was 18.5

  continued.
      Three or four members of the 13-nation Organisation of

  Asian cocoa producers are expanding
  output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss
  suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior.
      ""Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market
  from our product,"" said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate
  general of plantations. ""We're happy about our long-term future.""
      Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in
  Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable
  for European tastes.
      They were responding to comments by London traders that
  large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesia
  and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa
  prices.
      London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered
  unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a
  high level of free fatty acids.
      Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers'
  Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the
  United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western
  Europe.
      A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the
  London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with
  high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans.
      ""When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything to
  talk down prices,"" the spokesman said.
      He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces.
      PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa
  year ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exported
  to West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to the
  Netherlands and Britain.
      The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry official
  who wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problem
  with quality and would continue to expand sales. He described
  criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as ""trade politics""
  and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it
  did not have any difficulty with exports.
      Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia's two biggest commodity
  producers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the
  International Cocoa Organization (ICCO).
      Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to
  total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987.
      This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because of
  the end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largest
  cocoa growing area.
      Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600
  tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output is
  projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes
  this year as young trees mature.
      Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and
  traders said they could last out low prices longer than West
  African countries.
      According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices would
  have to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to
  make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic.
      Some traders believe the main quality problem is with
  harvesting and fermentation techniques.
      One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually
  indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the
  same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian
  estates.

  Oil prices would skyrocket for a time if
  conflict in the Gulf closed the Strait of Hormuz, but oil
  supplies could be adjusted to take care of world demand,
  Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said.
      He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Military
  action in the Gulf.
      But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian
  Petroleum Association, he said, ""If worst comes to worst and say
  the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely
  shut off, I believe the world oil supply, given time to adjust,
  can take care of the situation.""
      ""But this is not to say that prices, at least for a short
  duration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of
  the situation,"" he declared.
      Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relatively
  short-term impact on prices, he added.
      Assessing future price trends, he said, ""Short-term spot
  prices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likely
  hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per
  barrel.
      ""The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greater
  than the downward ones.""
      ""The balance between supply and demand in the short term
  will still be delicate,"" he added. ""Non-Opec production may still
  go up, competing with Opec for the expected additional increase
  in world demand.""
      Subroto, a member of Opec's three-man quota committee which
  has been touring cartel members, said speculation may play
  havoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize the
  situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers.
      In the medium term, non-Opec production would reach a
  plateau in the early 1990s, leaving Opec much stronger, he
  said.

  The Philippine coconut industry has

  requiring some edible oils to be labelled as saturated fats.
      The bill, which was defeated by the Senate Agriculture
  Committee on Monday, could have cost about 60 mln dlrs a year

      ""Naturally, we welcomed the defeat but there is a chance the

  Senate bill,"" a spokesman for the United Coconut Association of

      PCA chairman Jose Romero noted the vote was close, with

      The UCAP spokesman said the American Soybean Association
  (ASA) had spent about 25 mln dlrs lobbying for the bill.
      He said the ASA also had obscured the health issue during
  the debate.
      ""Coconut oil is high in saturated fats, but unlike saturated
  animal fats, they do not enter the blood and lymph systems

  of domestic unsaturated alternatives.

  Indonesia told the oil industry on
  Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and

  expenditure on exploration in return.
      President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian
  Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend
  contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.
      ""In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the
  government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending
  production sharing contracts under the present laws,"" Suharto
  said.
      ""Apart from that, the government will keep improving the
  investment climate in order to accelerate the development of
  the petroleum industry,"" he said.
      Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he
  was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that
  contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be
  renewed before they would invest in further exploration.
      ""As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully
  aware of this situation,"" Subroto said.
      ""The government has already made the political decision to
  entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers
  to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a
  selective basis.""
      Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil
  reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil
  industry sources say.
      Subroto said the government was also working to ease other
  problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or
  deep water conditions.
      But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way
  and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now
  that the oil price had recovered.
      President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of
  technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil
  industry for the regions in which companies operated.
      Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company
  Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production
  expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to
  fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in
  1986.
      Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation
  contracts with foreign oil companies.
      Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field
  operations was a government priority. There had been
  misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry
  in certain areas, such as when a field is designated
  commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.
      He said the government wanted to finalise contract
  extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the
  meantime to maintain its exploration drive.
      Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain
  exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire
  within 10 years. ""This need in itself is some sort of guarantee
  that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement.""
      Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal
  between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.
      Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved
  detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.
      Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions
  would be selective, based on how much capital would be
  invested.

      The lawsuits would be filed with competent international

  City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
      He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs
  ""except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence."" Reacting to
  Weinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed,
  Aqazadeh said: ""Iran will also consider the case closed after
  its retaliatory measure."" Iranian officials have said their
  response would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interests
  around the world might come under attack.
      Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulf
  aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's
  oil more difficult, but he did not see the U.S. Attack
  significantly affecting oil prices.
      IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the

  A voluntary compliance system for
  monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed
  skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and
  trade sources.
      ""Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and 
  importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of
  the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it
  became a matter of the trade monitoring each other,"" one
  analyst said.
      On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said
  the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a
  voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to
  monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.
      Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee
  importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the
  U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring
  authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,
  it will still be allowed entry.
      While many believe producers will not seek to add to the
  overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some
  will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of
  monitoring controls, trade sources said.
      ""Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted
  to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,"" a
  U.S. Customs spokesman said.
      ""Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when
  its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand
  Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to
  destination),"" he said.
      Many see it as a true test of whether producers and
  importers will abide by the quota system.
      ""It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the
  quota agreement,"" said one major U.S. roaster.
       ""Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did
  not act as a gentleman,"" said another analyst adding, ""without
  the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the
  producers' hands.""
      Some feel that importers will take advantage of the
  voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,
  in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.
  Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member
  countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely
  labelled.
      According to customs officials, several green coffee
  importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee
  fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,
  forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy
  beans.
      ""If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for
  one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of
  their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by
  circumventing the quota provisions,"" said Paine Webber analyst
  Bernie Savaiko.
      Still, others believe that producers will not be hard
  pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in
  the U.S. in the near term.
      ""It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not
  have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system
  seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so
  much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a
  threat,"" one trader said.

  Oilmeal demand remained strong in the
  United States in July and August and six pct up on levels seen
  in the same months last year, with most of the rise coming in
  soymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.
      Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose to
  a record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pct
  on the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal at
  seven pct, it said.
      Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and
  330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago months
  following a huge increase in soymeal imports.
      Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediately
  but went into stocks. With imports again large in September, it
  estimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes by
  October 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.
      EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a year
  earlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,
  sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due to
  bumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record
  5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year. Rapeseed disposals
  were reported at 2.1 mln tonnes by September 20 against 1.4 mln

  The Soviets have not indicated an
  urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely
  that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit
  expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng told Reuters.
      In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did
  not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat
  subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.
      ""Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.
  There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that
  there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a
  wheat subsidy).""
      When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet
  summit, Lyng said, ""No, I don't think so. I don't think that.""
      The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to
  Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for
  discussion at a summit.
      ""It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the
  Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions
  about,"" Lyng said.
      ""When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for
  agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was
  not something that would be discussed with the President of the
  United States. He said it's not presidential,"" Lyng said.
      Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major
  producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the
  still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final
  decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.
      The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement
  will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the
  Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the
  long-standing agreement.
      ""We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have
  failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would
  love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,
  but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.
  These are some of the questions we need to discuss.""
      When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from
  the agreement, Lyng said, ""I don't know. It certainly hasn't
  been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running
  they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an

  The United States and India have
  not yet agreed on a food aid package to help the

  Lyng said.
      Lyng told Reuters in an interview that the two countries
  have been discussing a package but that he did not expect the
  specifics of the offer to be announced during Indian Prime
  Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit here this week.
      ""We have been talking about the potential needs that India

  as well as the possibilities of assistance,"" Lyng said.
      ""At this point, there is no detailed plan or program. The
  amounts of what commodities are uncertain. But we have
  indicated to the Indians that we stand ready to assist in
  whatever way they deem most valuable,"" he said.
      There has been speculation in trade circles that USDA would
  offer India subsidized vegetable oil under the export
  enhancement program and donate surplus corn under Section 419
  of an amended 1949 law.
      Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agree
  on the mix of concessional and commercial aid, and that
  Washington would prefer the package include something other
  than donated food.
      ""The Indians are capable of purchasing a lot, of taking care
  of themselves. India is a country that has come a long way in
  its ability to produce food and they have a great pride in
  that,"" Lyng said.
      ""We (the United States) obviously, with the surpluses we
  still have of many commodities..., would like to share in the
  import business the Indians do, and then we have some, as we
  always do, compassion for the people of India and would like to
  cooperate with them,"" he said.
      Lyng said he had no plans to meet with Indian officials
  during Gandhi's visit here, adding, ""I just don't know of
  anything that might be announced specifically.""
      Asked if ""the ball was in the Indians' court,"" he said, ""Yes.""

  Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2
  pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in
  August, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here.
      Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at
  several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at
  fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field
  rescue project.
      Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's
  voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil
  output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise
  oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.
      Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the
  production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all
  its North Sea fields for the rest of the year.
      Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway
  would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.
      The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which
  pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August,
  field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.
      Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use
  the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while
  Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.
      BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula
  field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping
  to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.
      Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd
  last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company
  said.
      September production was also sharply higher at the
  Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which
  extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd
  against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats
  Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.
      Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like
  Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd
  in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous
  month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.
      Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd
  in September, compared with 100,188 in August.
      Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test
  output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl
  totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in
  August.
      Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on
  stream a second well, cutting September production to just two
  days.

      ""God willing, we will carry out our duty in the coming days

  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a
  global farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although the
  United States opposes key parts of the proposal.
      ""We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal.
  It will help us in getting the negotiations underway,"" Lyng
  told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.
      Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg
  endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission.
  The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay
  round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.
      Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan
  seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing
  curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.
      The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all
  farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has
  pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching
  a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.
      However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the
  Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is
  unrealistic.
      Asked about such criticism, Lyng said ""The alternative to
  doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I
  think that is the unrealistic position.""
      ""I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are
  trying to say.""
      Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a
  freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations 
  started.
      ""All that some countries would like to have would be a
  wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat.
  That doesn't do a thing for us,"" Lyng said.
      The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of
  agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he
  said.
      At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is
  expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC.

  acceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposals
  to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export
  performance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction.
      Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive
  months between April 1, 1985, and September 30, 1987, to be
  used for calculating the export performace portion.
      The IBC will total all the figures, calculate each shippers
  participation and use this as a basis for allocation of
  individual quotas, the IBC spokesman said.
      He said the IBC has already settled with the Sao Paulo
  Mercantile Exchange how the auction system will operate.
  Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable
  on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this
  premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export
  sales declaration form.
      Auctions will not start until after the opening of export
  registrations. The spokesman could not say when this might be
  but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of
  the week, opening registraions from Monday.
      A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of the

  The European Community's farmers'

  which has already been proposed by the EC Commission.
      Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference on

  for cereal substitutes.
      He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the
  Danish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chair
  meetings of their EC colleagues.
      Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help
  the EC's budget problems and would provide some price stability
  for producers.
      This would in turn help the market position for certain
  crops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peas
  and beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severe
  output restrictions.
      A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax
  on imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats
  succeeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual EC
  price fixing.
      However, the EC Commission has said it maintains its
  proposals for a tax.
      Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursue
  international negotiations on farm trade with the aim of

  Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
  said the ruling of a GATT panel on a U.S. trade complaint
  against Japan, expected soon, may influence the U.S. stance in
  negotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas.
      The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japan
  end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the
  end of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will
  favor the U.S.
      ""These are quota items, and the principles that apply to
  them, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question of
  whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus,"" Lyng
  told Reuters in an interview.
      He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas on
  beef and citrus after March 31, next year.
      The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United
  States has challenged include items such as tomato paste, some
  cheeses and specialty fruit juices.
      U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would
  be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has
  been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman.
      The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus
  quotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect
  Japanese farmers.
      ""We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on
  beef and citrus). If they impose them we would consider that an
  illegal action in the GATT, Lyng said.
      He declined to say what action the U.S. would take next
  April if Japan continues to resist U.S. demands.

  The American Soybean Association (ASA)
  denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal
  under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and
  threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not
  remedy the situation.
      ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored
  Outlook 87 conference: ""It will be filed unless the EC takes
  drastic and immediate steps.""
      ""These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,
  since they were established after the zero soybean duty was
  established in 1962,"" he said.
      The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask
  for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to
  make the regime non-discriminatory.
      The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in
  an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production
  has risen dramatically since then.
      The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world
  market levels and is considering implementing a controversial
  oils and fats tax.
      The subsidies ""are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero
  duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,"" Adams
  said.
      The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its
  trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an
  EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the
  EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.
      U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in
  volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of
  EC policies, Adams added.
      Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at
  the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973
  when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.

  The United States is prepared to ""pull out
  all the stops"" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador
  to GATT Michael Samuels said.
      Those rights are now being challenged by the European
  Community's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a
  conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.
      He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if
  the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without
  the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.
      The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect
  on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat
  shipments into the EC.
      The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.
  trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed
  prices over the current market level and which may be extended
  to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.
      Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,
  an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade
  negotiations, ""is meaningless if import barriers continue to be
  erected,"" Samuels said.
      Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm
  subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, ""visionary""
  and ""very serious.""  The EC and Japan have said it is
  unrealistic.
      The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal
  on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally
  next week.
      The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce
  tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals
  substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of
  farm subsidies.
      The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as
  they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major
  trade distortions, Samuels said.
      Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally
  submitted and respond to it officially then.
      ""We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este
  declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,""
  the U.S. Ambassador said.
      The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores
  the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.
      The key difference between the two approaches is that the
  U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing
  only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.
      If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,
  there would be little incentive for the Community to work to
  correct the international trade situation, he added.
      Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC
  oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to
  third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the
  U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

      In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also acknowledged he was
  troubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program

  The Soviet oil production target for 1988
  has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes over
  this year's planned output.
      Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday
  at the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament.
      He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil
  deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an
  upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation
  which began in late 1983.
      Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil,

  The European Community (EC) agreed a
  trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country
  following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC
  officials said.
      Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina
  will gain additional trading rights on a series of products
  including meat, fish and cereals by-products.
      But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with
  Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the
  officials said.
      The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC
  states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased
  quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.
      Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,
  saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals
  substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the
  officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from
  improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the
  quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500
  tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will
  be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.
      Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of
  5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced
  levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.
      The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said
  that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their
  exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They
  have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement
  on Tariffs and Trade).
      But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve
  Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had
  been affected by the country's EC membership.
      Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the
  fish dispute with Canada.
      Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC
  claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has
  improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied
  with Japanese offers of compensation.
      Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on
  citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some
  other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear
  and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.
      EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told
  journalists: ""We maintain our position that the (Japanese)
  concessions were not enough.""

  U.S. military planners ruled out
  Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack
  mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the
  Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.
      U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and
  raided another in what the administration called a ""measured and
  appropriate response"" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last
  Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.
      Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig
  rather than an onshore economic or military target such as
  Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to
  limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at
  home and in the Gulf.
      ""It simply demonstrated the United States will take military
  action when they (Iran) take military action,"" Norman Polmar, a
  defense analyst and author, said.
      He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the
  embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding
  an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.
      In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the
  potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that
  could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.
      Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq
  war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target
  to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General
  Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a
  Security Council call for a ceasefire.
      ""We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any
  chance at all,"" he said, adding that the action made it clear
  tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.
  
     In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon
  to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington
  also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's
  economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had
  been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the
  lower Gulf.
      ""We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown
  Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting
  capabilities,"" Cordesman said.
      He predicted the United States would respond to any future
  major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar
  Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the
  approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.
      Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the
  United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, ""but
  we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action
  by Iran with stronger countermeasures.""

  Brazil's September trade surplus

  compared with 1.434 billion dlrs in August and 540 mln dlrs in
  September last year, Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department

      Coffee accounted with 320 mln dlrs of exports, up from 222

      The Cacex director said he expected the country's trade

      Some Gulf sea captains were reported to be steering well

  The United States may lift an
  additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later
  this month, Reagan Administration officials said.
      President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on
  Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986
  agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third
  country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.
      The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on
  Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and
  portable computers.
      Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after
  Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at
  below production costs.
      Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory
  and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.
      The Administration officials said Commerce Department 
  monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the
  semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking
  sales away from American-made semiconductors.
      They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would
  be lifted by the end of the month.
      The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the
  closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.
      U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance

      Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed

  Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead
  to a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.
      While Democrats and Republicans praised the U.S.

  Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
  said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada
  and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the
  global trading system.
      He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back
  worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.
      The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay
  to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it
  trade in agriculture and services such as banking.
      Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting
  marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The
  Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet
  been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.
      The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove
  tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and
  many services.
      Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli
  pacts ""other countries have realized that if they want to
  continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had
  better get serious about improving the GATT.""
      The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing
  shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially
  increase the gross national products in both countries.
      Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should
  serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.
      Yeutter said, ""increasing trade is one of the keys to
  enhanced political and economic stability around the globe.""
      He said, ""a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only
  for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries
  that need to increase trade in order to better their standards
  of living.""
      Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress
  made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to
  protectionism.
      He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress
  that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions
  against nations with large trade surpluses with the United
  States if the countries practiced unfair trade.
      The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade
  deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still
  rising.
      Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to
  resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President
  Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.
      Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.
      He said, ""President Reagan will veto any bill that contains
  serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained.""

  Dwindling global crude oil reserves and
  the lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send
  the world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former Atlantic
  Richfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said.
      ""It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks,"" Anderson
  told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. ""I
  believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in
  two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find.""
      Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil
  and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln
  barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about
  4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.
      ""If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up
  one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle
  East,"" he said. ""We're soon going to be right back where we
  were in 1973 and 1979.""
      Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at
  about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.
      ""There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't
  enough supply,"" he said. ""There have been no major oil
  discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years.""
      Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major world
  discovery, has already produced about five billion barrels of
  oil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said.

  A proposal to require imported

      The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a
  10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopes
  the plan would be adopted this year.
      A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.
      Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an
  amendment to a farm spending reduction package.
      ""I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as giving
  American consumers the information they need,"" he said.
      Proponents of the measure, including the American Soybean
  Association, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oils
  are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.
      The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicating
  tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage
  consumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,
  Indonesia and the Philippines.
      But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.
  Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal
  ""blatantly discriminates"" against imports, would be impossible to

  platform on Monday and said it should not worsen the Gulf
  crisis.
      ""The United States is fully entitled to take military action
  in exercise of rights of self-defense, in the face of the
  imminent threat of further attacks,"" Howe said in a statement
  issued in London.
      The United States said its forces destroyed the platform on
  Monday in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on a U.S.-
  flagged Kuwaiti ship last Friday.
      Referring to that attack, Howe added, ""I trust the Iranians
  will fully understand that continued attacks of this kind will
  only enhance justification for firm action in self-defense.""
      At a press conferenced in Luxembourg during a meeting of
  European Community (EC) ministers, Howe was asked about
  statements from a senior Iranian official who said America was
  now involved in a full-scale war.
      ""It would be profoundly undesirable and quite unjustified
  for Iran to react in that way,"" he said.

  Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like
  beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.
      One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,
  was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.
      The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and
  concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60
  metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.
  Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.
      The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section
  of the structure remained.
      U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an
  American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.
  forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had
  been caught laying mines.
      But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense
  officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm
  missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday
  and the Sea Isle City on Friday.
      Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a
  key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.
      Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East
  now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti
  tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.
      But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level
  of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result
  of U.S. intervention and Iran's response.
      The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a
  U.S. ""tit-for-tat"" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said
  Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.
      He said with this appraoch America would suffer ""the death
  of one thousand cuts.""
      But for the United States to grab the initiative
  militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's
  harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its
  shipping must pass, Schuler said.
      He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing
  Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,
  Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.
      Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic
  initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an
  arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.
      He said the United States should also threaten to mine and
  blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to
  acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a
  settlement.
      Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by
  invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the
  outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style
  infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.
      Each side has attacked the others' shipping.

  A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform
  in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid
  carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab
  allies, Western diplomats in the region said.
      U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that
  U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf
  in response to a missile strike on the American-registered
  Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
      ""We consider the matter closed,"" he said, a signal the U.S.
  administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.
      Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day
  against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action
  would endanger American interests.
      Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's War
  Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a
  ""crushing blow.""
      ""The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in
  no way get out safely,"" Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.
      Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid
  ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on
  November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.
      Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in
  Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in
  preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.
      Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab
  states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they
  said.
      ""The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran to
  respond one way or the other,"" a diplomat said.
      President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American
  countermeasures if the military escalation continued.
      Western diplomats and military sources in the area said
  shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act
  the United States could have taken once it had decided to
  retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans
  and Kuwaitis on Iran.
      ""It's interesting that they chose something in international
  waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation,"" one
  diplomat said. ""This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf
  Arab states, particularly Kuwait.""
      Commented another diplomat: ""Kuwait must be happy that the
  U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked
  on its doorstep.""
      One source said of the attack on the oil platform: ""They
  managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the
  least nuisance to everybody.""
      A diplomat commented: ""They were very clever in the place
  they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated
  anything because it wasn't working in the first place.""
      A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke:
  ""This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up
  ... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans).""

  Military experts say the United States
  faces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of an
  Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a
  U.S.-flagged tanker.
      The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is
  likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as
  long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching
  limited retaliatory strikes.
      But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps
  -- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or
  destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.
      ""Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the
  cycle of attack and retaliation continues,"" said Fred Axelgard,
  a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and
  International Studies (CSIS).
      ""It's like a Greek tragedy,"" said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll
  of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)
  think tank.
      Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for
  Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to
  the war between Iran and Iraq.
      They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its
  30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began
  escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal 
  would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which
  President Reagan could never accept.
      U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon
  news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel
  fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam
  oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf
  time (0700 EDT) on Monday.
      Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military
  base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian
  Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea
  Isle City on Friday.
      Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and
  allowed to escape.
      ""We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will
  be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran
  with stronger countermeasures,"" Weinberger said.
      ""We consider this matter closed,"" he said.
      Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives
  agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not
  escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was
  whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken
  this view after earlier clashes.

  The U.S. is drafting options including
  possible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute over
  the differential between soybean and product  taxes which
  Buenos Aires levies on exports.
      The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure
  of high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed
  by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S.
  officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina's differential
  export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in
  competition with the U.S.
      ""Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict
  (Argentine) access to our market,"" said one U.S. source.
     
      The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after
  Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to
  end the differential.
      But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88
  year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.
      Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agriculture
  minister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroille
  on September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could not
  narrow the differential further for 1987/88.
      As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is considering
  restrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beef
  and finished leather, the U.S. sources said.
      A decision on reprisals is likely to be made by the Reagan
  administration soon, they said.

  Recent announcements from Moscow of
  next year's grain production targets indicate that the Soviets
  are estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes,
  Agriculture Department analysts said.
      USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but
  some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987
  grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.
      Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday,
  putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of
  Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in
  Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be
  ""25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year.""
      ""This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213
  mln tonne (grain) crop,"" the analyst said.
     
      In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235
  mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure
  published in a Soviet economic journal this month.
      USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a
  range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.
      Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest
  progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.
      While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture
  official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be
  as good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest.
      A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mln
  tonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would
  bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes.

  Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on
  world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains
  that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the
  Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said.
      December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before
  falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.
      ""Fundamentals are awful,"" said Philip Lambert, analyst with
  stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC
  production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln
  bpd, little changed from September levels.
      Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC
  production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and
  International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September
  production at 18.5 mln bpd.
      The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of
  a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea
  Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,
  in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag
  commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.
      The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the
  area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.
      Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on
  Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.
  Attack, analysts said.
      They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which
  around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in
  the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.
      Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in
  the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf
  hostilities, analysts said.
      But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian
  missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.
      Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,
  said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.
      ""The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond
  to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any
  further action will be met with a like-for-like response.
  Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,"" Pyne said.
      Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was ""a
  responsible retaliation,"" with the U.S. Apparently indicating to
  Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran
  chose to raise the level of conflict.
      Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.
      He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as
  Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests
  the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a
  result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian
  retaliation.
      The initial upward market move this morning reflected a
  strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which
  was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile
  launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.
      The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy
  attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary
  Caspar Weinburger.
      Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the
  Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less
  serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,

      This is the first time in many years that a factory has
  been closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.
      Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,
  but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.
      Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British
  Sugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year
  out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.
      Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting
  problems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining
  its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2
  mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the
  spokesman said.
      British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.
      The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,
  is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories
  normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the
  campaign.
      As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been
  harvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13
  pct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather has
  severely restricted beet lifting.
      Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yet
  available.

  An Iowa State University study showed
  pork contains considerably less fat than indicated by
  long-established U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics, the
  National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) said.
      Six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the study
  averaged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below American Heart
  Association guidelines for recommended foods. Eighty pct of all
  the raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study contained
  less than six pct fat, the NPPC said.
      Meanwhile, USDA Handbook 8-10 - long used as the
  established authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fat
  content for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the NPPC said.
      Robin Kline, a dietitian and Director of Consumer Affairs
  for the NPPC said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancy
  between the study and the USDA handbook.
      ""Handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on information
  that has been accumulated over the past 30 years. The
  statistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of today
  which is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago,
  thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices,""
  Kline said.
      The study, funded by NPPC with producer checkoff money,
  evaluated pork carcasses from 47 Iowa producers in categories
  from 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat. Researchers measured the fat
  content of the seven muscles before cooking, and the fat,
  moisture and tenderness of cooked boneless rib chops.

  The Soviet Union outlined its economic
  targets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improve
  standards in the country's sluggish engineering industry.
      Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet
  industrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a
  planned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.
      Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent
  to gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against a
  planned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures the
  output of a country's goods and services.
      He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of
  grain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscow
  produced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.
      Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described
  machine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is
  essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on
  world markets.
      ""Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the
  machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a
  considerable amount of the equipment that it requires,"" said
  Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.
      Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes
  machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,
  increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987
  compared with the same period last year.
      However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase planned
  for the industry for the whole of 1988.
      Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent
  meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to
  a large extent on conserving resources better. ""Large-scale
  measures are planned to save resources,"" he said.
      Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that
  defense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the same
  figure as was announced last year.
      Western governments view official Soviet estimates for
  defense spending as highly understated, but say the real figure
  is hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are
  intertwined with the civilian economy.
      Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spending
  next year on medical services, education, pensions and social
  insurance schemes.

  The official Soviet news agency Tass
  denounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in
  the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would
  bring no dividends to the Reagan administration.
      Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration
  had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect
  attention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms
  to Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels.
      ""The confrontation is a fact now. What is obvious is that
  the latest military adventure will not bring political
  dividends to the American administration,"" Krutikhin said.
      Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard
  Shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on
  Monday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they were
  concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs.
      Soviet officials have previously criticized the United
  States for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying their
  presence serves to increase tension.
      Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and
  Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought
  broader contacts with Iran in the last year.
      Krutikhin said: ""The United States has undertaken an act of
  armed aggression against Iran, the probability of which has
  long been spoken of by Washington officials.""

  South Korea's national news agency, Yonhap,
  said this year's current account surplus will near 10 billion
  dlrs amid signs of continuing high world demand for the
  country's cheap cars and electronic goods.
      Bank of Korea officials would neither confirm nor deny the
  Yonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its own
  figures later in the week.
      Yonhap said the January-September surplus in the current
  account, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled
  7.03 billion dlrs.
      This already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for the
  whole of 1987 that the government set in June during talks with
  the International Monetary Fund aimed at averting a too rapid
  revaluation of the won against the dollar.
      The agency said the September surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs,
  up from 468.1 mln in August and 899 mln a year earlier.
      ""Exports in October could be relatively modest due to many
  public holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus will
  be well over nine billion dollars, close to ten,"" Yonhap said.
      The sharp rise in the September surplus came from a
  resumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previous
  month.
      More than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers,
  electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrest
  between July and September.
      The South Korean government originally targeted a five
  billion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raise
  this to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half export
  boom.
      If confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplus
  seemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the United
  States which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit with
  Seoul last year, government economists said.
      The U.S. Government, trying to stem protectionist pressure
  at home, has called on South Korea to open more markets to
  American goods and revalue the won faster.

  Malaysia's recovery from the worst
  recession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when the
  government announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988
  after seven years of austerity, economists said.
      ""Our country is walking on one leg now,"" said Ismail Salleh,
  an economist with the Institute of Strategic and International
  Studies. ""It has to depend on public sector investment for
  faster growth if the private sector is not moving.""
      Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking
  one pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.
      The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under
  two pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct
  because prices for commodity exports have risen sharply.
  Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin and
  semiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.
      The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billion
  ringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.
      Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pct
  in 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.
      Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmen
  blaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.
      One businessman said too many politicians give the

  which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.
      Political leaders have said the budget will not hurt
  ordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential
  goods are unlikely to change.
      Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the
  corporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia to
  compete for investors with neighbouring states.

  China expects its 1987 grain harvest to be
  397 mln tonnes, eight mln tonnes short of its target, the New
  China News Agency quoted a State Statistical Bureau spokesman
  as saying.
      The harvest will be China's second highest in history but
  poor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmers
  have kept yields down, earlier Chinese press reports said.
      Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mln
  tonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall.
      Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mln
  tonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09
  mln in the same 1986 period.
      Agriculture Minister He Kang said last month state prices
  for grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increase
  the incentive for grain production.
      China could not afford to become a major food importer, he
  said.
      The State Statistics Bureau spokesman also said China's
  1987 cotton output was expected to rise 10 pct over 1986 to 390
  mln tonnes.

  The Philippine 1987 inflation rate will
  rise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the government
  implements an employers' association recommendation for a 10
  pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month,
  Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said.
      The government's own proposal for an across-the-board daily
  pay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eight
  pesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year average
  higher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week.
      The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by the
  Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP).
      The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflation
  rate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4
  pct if the government's recommendation is implemented, Solita
  said. Both were proposed last month.
      Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pct
  by the National Economic and Development Authority early this
  month.
      In the first three months of the year, inflation was a
  negative 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 pct respectively, rising to 1.0, 2.5
  and 4.6 pct in April May and June, the National Statistics
  Office said.
      The annual inflation rate rose to 5.8 pct in June, 6.2 pct
  in July and 6.15 and 6.188 pct in August and September
  respectively, the National Statistics Office said.
      It attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and water
  prices.
      The government's six and eight peso wage increases would
  displace up to 20,000 workers, Monsod said, bringing the number
  of unemployed to 4.2 mln or 19.2 pct of the population.

  A sharp rise in Soviet sugar consumption
  since the start of the Kremlin's anti-alcohol drive indicates
  home brewing is costing the state 20 billion roubles in lost
  vodka sales, Pravda said.
      The Communist Party newspaper said sugar sales had
  increased by one mln tonnes a year, enough to be turned into
  two billion bottles of moonshine.
      At current vodka prices of 10 roubles a bottle, it said,
  this meant illicit alcohol consumption had reached the
  equivalent of 20 billion roubles a year, or annual revenues
  from vodka sales before the May 1985 anti-alchohol decree.
      ""Official statistics show a reduction in consumption of
  vodka, but this is a deceptive statistic -- it does not count
  home-brew,"" Pravda said.
      ""The epidemic first engulfed the villages and has now also
  firmly settled into cities, where the availability of natural
  gas, running water and privacy has made it much easier.""
      Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev launched the anti-alcohol
  campaign shortly after taking office in March 1985 as a first

  &lt;STAT.OL>, operator on Norway's North Sea Veslefrikk oil field,
  has placed field development contracts totalling 1.5 billion
  crowns with two domestic yards, the company said in a
  statement.
      Moss Rosenberg Verft, a subsidiary of Kvaerner Industrier
  A/S &lt;KVIO.OL> won a 1.2 billion crown contract to convert
  Statoil's semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floating
  production platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixed
  well-head platform to be placed on the field, it said.
      Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S
  &lt;AMVO.OL>, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build the
  well-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand
  in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig.
      Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a
  fixed platform would cut construction time, enabling field
  partners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several
  months earlier than previously planned.
      Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln
  barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 km
  west of Bergen.
      Statoil estimates the field's total development cost,
  including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns. Planned daily output
  is 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas.
      Veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby Oseberg

  will be fed into the Statpipe line, which gathers gas from
  Norway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields.

  International Rubber Organisation
  (INRO) buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister said tests had
  shown the quality of rubber in stock was acceptable, but
  acknowledged that some consumers were now wary of buying it.
      ""We have said all along that the rubber is holding up well
  from a condition and quality standpoint...Rubber stored in
  proper conditions does not deteriorate,"" he told Reuters in a
  telephone interview. The quality of buffer stock rubber sold
  since he entered the market in September would be discussed at
  an INRO Council meeting which opened here today, he said.
      Tokyo traders said on Friday they had little interest in
  buying rubber from the INRO buffer stock because of possible
  poor quality.
      Hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the
  ""may-sell' level of 232 cents per kg early last month. INRO's
  five-day moving average was quoted at 237.3 cents on October
  16. He said the quality of five to six-year old rubber in stock
  was uppermost in consumers' minds.
      ""We have received good interest for the rubber. I understand
  the Japanese concern. Many consumers want to try the rubber
  before they carry on buying,"" he said.
      Hofmeister said INRO rubber was stored in 28 different
  locations in producing and consuming nations, adding all
  warehouses used were suitable for long-term storage.
      Selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during the
  past week to 10 days and this could reflect a ""wait and see
  attitude"" by buyers, he said.
      ""Consumers are holding back from buying additional amounts
  until they test out the rubber. If their tests are positiive,
  they are likely to buy more."" Hofmeister said he could reduce
  the offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interest
  but INRO did not want to depress prices artificially.
      Hofmeister declined to comment on Japanese trade estimates
  that he had sold around 30,000 to 32,000 tonnes in Kuala Lumpur
  and New York since September.
      But he said Japanese traders were in a position to have an
  idea of the quantity he had sold, noting that traders overall
  had put buffer stock sales at between 25,000 and 35,000 tonnes.
      The question of sales from the original 360,000 tonne
  buffer stock is expected to be the main topic of the Council
  meeting which is scheduled to end on Thursday.
      The current international rubber pact expires on October
  22.
      The deadline for the new pact's start is January 1989 and
  Hofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber during
  the interim period.

  Uganda plans to export roasted coffee to

      A.R. Sendi said on Sunday that Uganda's Ministry of
  Industry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grind
  and pack local coffee for export. Construction will start in
  December and the factory should be ready by next October.
      He said the Marketing Ministry has authorised the Coffee

  tonnes of beans a year for processing and export. Sendi also
  told reporters he had negotiated a 69.7 mln French franc loan

      Uganda is the world's fifth largest coffee producer, and
  expects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year.
      Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefit
  Uganda's economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln
  (60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under the
  latest International Coffee Agreement.
      In addition, the value of roasted coffee should be

  The Soviet Union has agreed to supply

      IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza

  agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed
  during his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet
  Union might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said.
      Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility

  southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union.
      Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of
  its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf.
      Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet

  The Soviet Union's industrial output is
  growing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign trade
  has fallen, Central Statistical Office figures show.
      Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda show
  industrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of
  1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period.
      Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986
  period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2
  pct.
      Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billion
  roubles. Separate import and export figures were not given.
      One factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction
  of a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Last
  year's calculations of industrial output included all goods,
  irrespective of quality.
      Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leader
  Mikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, special
  inspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below
  standard.
      Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were
  rejected in the nine-month period.
      The figures also showed that on October 1, there were more
  than 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000
  people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector,
  Pravda said, without giving comparative figures.
      The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the
  economy has been an important part of the modernisation
  campaign, with measures introduced recently to allow the
  setting up of small shops on a private basis.
      Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine months
  against 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986.
      But western economists said they treat Soviet productivity
  figures with caution, as they are more broadly based than in
  the West, which measures worker output over a given period.
      Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Union
  as of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5
  mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same period
  last year. Average earnings were 200 roubles a month against
  194 roubles a year ago.

  Showers continued throughout the week in
  the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early
  January and improving prospects for the coming temporao,
  although normal humidity levels have not been restored,
  Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.
      The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.
      Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags
  of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93
  mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems
  that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the
  arrivals figures.
      Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how
  much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has
  practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates
  around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there
  are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
  middlemen, exporters and processors.
      There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit
  for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in
  obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.
      In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have
  sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.
      Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350
  cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.
      Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and
  only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to
  1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.
      New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with
  June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs
  under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs
  per tonne FOB.
      Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at
  4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.
      April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July

  2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and
  2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.
      Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,
  Uruguay and open ports.
      Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for
  March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times
  New York Dec for Oct/Dec.
      Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible

  Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith

      Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of its

  is not going to raise its offer.
      ""I think that (an increase) would be totally wrong. I think

  about ligigation,"" he said. ""Let's wait and see how the offer
  runs.""
      Another official declined to speculate under what
  circumstances BP might raise its bid.
      The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7.2 times
  Standard's 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent

  the world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of
  credit, he explained.
      The company's debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12
  percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is
  completed, Chase said. But the ratio will be back below 40 pct
  within 12 months, he added.
      Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oil's publicly
  held shares are held by financial institutions.
      Simon said Standard's board was informed of the offer on
  March nine and has been considering it since that time.
      He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems that
  would delay completion of the acquisition. ""We have informed
  Washington of our intentions and we've already been an integral
  part of ownership of U.S. oil reserves,"" he pointed out.
      Simon said there is a good chance that current world oil
  prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained, and that
  the more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in
  Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production.
      ""We think there are signals that current conditions are
  more favorable than they have been for sometime,"" Simon said.
      ""We have hopes for greater stability, but we do not see
  prices going much higher,"" he added.

  British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay
  7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has
  signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said.
      ""I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and
  clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they
  think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,""
  said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
      BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70
  dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already
  own.
      ""It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the
  war and oil prices are not going to crack,"" said Prescott, Ball
  and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier.
      ""Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the
  energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those
  that are acquisition targets,"" Lazier said.
      One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an
  energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl
  Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a
  Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock.
      Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms
  falling into takeover situations for several years, with the
  exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp &lt;AHC>. He said most of
  the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking
  which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point
  that they have become unattractive.
      U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon
  Corp &lt;XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> jumped
  1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco &lt;TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal
  Corp &lt;UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY>
  climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp &lt;AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4.
      Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to
  71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4.
  Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its
  offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it
  would not raise the 70 dlr bid.
      British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8.
      Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in
  the first place indicates that the British oil giant has
  changed its outlook for the oil industry.
      Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the
  more bearish positions on oil prices.
      ""They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a
  barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty
  retreat from that point of view,"" Margoshes said.
      ""They are more appropriately today looking more
  optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs
  (long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that
  will be exceeded,"" Margoshes said.
      The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was
  trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel.
      Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy
  up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when
  oil prices were falling last year.
      They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly
  more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil
  field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in
  the Alaskan North Slope.
      Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely
  attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and
  has hard-to-replace reserves.
      ""I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to
  increase their position in the U.S. market,"" Dean Witter
  analyst Eugene Nowak said.
      Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of the
  British government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP
  stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding
  sometime in the year beginning April one.
      After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserves
  would be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is
  held in the U.S.
      ""The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it
  into the United States. No other market can handle all that
  stock,"" said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua.
      In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on
  revenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the year
  earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs.

      The ICO executive board is set to meet in London from March

      ""It's going to be a routine meeting, an update of what has

      Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria, also talking to

  were too far apart to allow a prompt agreement on quotas.
      Brazil's coffee chief Jorio Dauster said yesterday Brazil
  would not change its coffee policies.
      Cardenas said the market situation was getting clearer

  USX Corp chairman David Roderick said
  the company had ended talks with British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP>
  about the possible sale of some energy assets and said USX has
  no immediate restructuring plans for its oil businesses.
      ""We have terminated our discussions,"" Roderick told Reuters
  after a speech to the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association
  here. He said USX was not conducting talks with any other
  possible buyer of its energy assets.
      Earlier today, BP said it planned to offer 70 dlrs per
  share for the Standard Oil Co's &lt;SRD> publicly held stock.
      USX said in December the company had held formal
  discussions with BP about the potential sale of some of its
  overseas oil assets and USX had received expressions of
  interest from a half dozen other oil companies.
      Roderick, in response to a question, said USX had no
  immediate plans to restructure its Marathon Oil Co, or Texas
  Oil and Gas Corp. He said USX also did not plan to sell any of
  its 49 pct interest in the giant Yates Field in west Texas.
      ""We want to maintain our production in the Yates Field
  during these difficult times,"" Roderick added.
      In response to a question, Roderick also said he did not
  know whether Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court was
  accumulating USX stock. In recent days, traders have suggested
  Holmes a Court was buying additional shares.
      Roderick said Carl Ichan, who terminated an eight billion
  dlr hostile takeover plan for USX in January, continued to hold
  a sizable interest in the company. ""Mr. Ichan still apparently
  has 11.4 pct. He hasn't bought any more stock or sold any,""
  Roderick said. ""He's a very satisfied shareholder right now. I
  talk with him monthly.""
      In his speech, Roderick predicted the fall in the value of
  the dollar would set the stage for the U.S. to solve its trade
  deficit problem which totaled 170 billion dlrs in 1986.
      ""I expect by the early 1990s the U.S. will be running a net
  trade surplus,"" Roderick said. ""I think the worst is over and
  we can look forward to stability and upward movement ahead.""
      However, the USX chairman warned that European trading

  French Agricultural Minister
  Francois Guillaume warned that France would flatly reject
  proposed reforms of the European Community, EC, cereals, sugar
  and oilseeds sectors, which he said would disrupt these
  markets.
      The EC Commission's proposals to shorten the intervention
  period and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase the
  financial burden on the sugar producers will also result in
  lower real prices for producers, he told farmers here.
      ""I give you my word that France, while it will not reject
  technical adjustments or serious discussion, will simply reply
  in the negative to these bad reforms,"" Guillaume told the annual
  conference of the country's major farm union, FNSEA 
  (Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles).
      Community agricultural ministers are due to meet again
  Monday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spiralling
  EC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88.
      Relations between the government and farmers have become
  strained in France in recent months.
      There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations by
  farmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices and
  further cutbacks in Community milk output.
      But Guillaume's warning that he would reject reorganisation
  of the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a major
  producer of both crops -- won him warm applause from the
  FNSEA's farmers.
      His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for the
  complete dismantling of the system of cross border taxes
  designed to smooth out currency differences known as Monetary
  Compensatory Amounts, MCA's, however, are unlikely to avoid
  further protests by producers.
      Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to go
  ahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroad
  against the EC Commission's proposals to overhaul the farm
  sector.
      ""The Minister's proposals back up our determination to
  organise union action in the coming weeks,"" he told reporters,
  adding that this could also act in Guillaume's favour on a
  ministerial level.
      Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before being
  appointed farm minister last spring.
      Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt that
  Guillaume was doing a good job as farm minister.
      There have been certain advances on cutting production
  costs, reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid, but
  there are still areas where more could be done such as on
  farmers' indebtedness, he said.
      Guillaume told the conference the government will make
  available 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producers
  reduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire.
      The government has already announced financial aid for the
  milk sector and it was not clear how much of the package
  announced today was new aid, Lacombe said.

  Extracts from a report by Italy's Budget
  Ministry on the country's economic development in 1986 showed
  gross domestic product (GDP) 2.7 pct higher in real terms than
  in 1985 but a rise in unemployment.
      GDP calculated at 1980 prices rose to 434,682 billion lire
  last year from 423,064 billion in 1985. On a current prices
  basis, GDP was up 11 pct, totalling 894,362 billion lire in
  1986 against 805,754 billion in 1985.
       But growth was insufficient to prevent a rise in
  unemployment to 11.1 pct last year from 10.3 pct in 1985, the
  ministry said.
      The report said falling oil prices and the depreciation of
  the dollar during 1986 had favoured oil-importing countries
  such as Italy.
      These factors helped Italy cut inflation to an average 6.3
  pct in 1986, down from 9.3 pct in 1985.
      They also helped a major improvement in the trade balance.
      On the basis of data recently recalculated by the national
  statistics institute Istat, Italy had a trade deficit in 1986
  of 3,722 billion lire, the report said. This slightly revises a

  British Petroleum Co PLC may have to
  raise its planned 70 dlrs a share tender offer for the publicly

      ""There's a lot of speculation here that someway or other
  they would be forced to come up with another bid,"" said Rosario
  Ilaqua of L.F. Rothschild.
      And despite BP managing director David Simon's denial today
  that BP would raise the offer, the analysts said that remained
  a distinct possibility.
      Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal Dutch/Shell
  Group's &lt;RD> &lt;SC> bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell Oil
  Co in 1984 and 1985. Royal Dutch/Shell eventually raised its
  initial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share, after
  lawsuits by minority shareholders.
      ""I think they're going to have to go a little higher
  eventually, just as Royal Dutch/Shell had to go a little higher
  for the Shell Oil minority shares,"" Bruce Lazier of Prescott
  Ball and Turben said. He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share.
      Royal Dutch/Shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30.5 pct
  of Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984. After
  objections from minority shareholders about the price, Royal
  Dutch/Shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender
  offer in April 1984.
      But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the
  offer. After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil,
  Royal Dutch/Shell agreed to another two dlrs increase.
      It ended up paying 5.67 billion dlrs for the outstanding
  Shell Oil stake, a significant premium to its original bid of
  about 5.2 billion dlrs.
      The analysts made their comments before Simon's remarks at
  a BP press conference in New York this afternoon.
      Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told
  clients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible. The
  analyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share.
      Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the
  Royal Dutch/Shell group precedent. But there may be shareholder
  lawsuits for the same reason, they said.

  Shell Oil board in 1984 and 1985.

      They would not disclose the council's recommendation, but
  the officials said earlier it was likely the council would call

      In a pact last summer, Japan summer agreed to stop dumping
  its semiconductors at less than cost in the United States and

  China called on the United States to
  remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading
  status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.
      But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing
  13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are
  inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade
  Congress to change laws which limit its exports.
      The official International Business newspaper today

      ""It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its

  for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese
  exports,"" the editorial said.
      ""The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against

  Top executives with Tenneco Corp &lt;TGT>
  and Sabine Corp &lt;SAB> said they expected world oil prices to
  gradually increase over the next two years as U.S. reliance on
  imports of oil from the Middle East grows.
       ""I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to a
  trend of gradually increasing prices,"" C.W. Nance, president of
  Tenneco Oil Exploration and Production, told a meeting of the
  Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association.
       Nance predicted that by 1990, the Organization of
  Producing and Exporting Countries would be producing at the
  rate of 80 pct of capacity.
      The gain will come largely through increased imports to the
  United States, he said.
      ""They will be able to raise the price again but I do not
  think they will raise it as much as they did in 1979,"" Nance
  said. He did not say how much of a price hike he expected.
       Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predicted
  that world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20
  dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in
  1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climb
  from a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between
  1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988.
       ""Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in
  increased demand,"" Shoup said, referring to the gas industry's
  outlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal law
  prohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants
  and utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15
  pct, he said.
       Tenneco's Nance also said that some U.S. cities may
  experience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next
  winter because of the industry's reduced deliverability.
       Tenneco's gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20
  pct during 1986, he said.
       ""This does not mean the gas bubble is gone,"" Nance said.
  ""We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question is
  how broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or three
  years before we start to climb out?""
        J.C. Walter of &lt;Walter Oil and Gas Corp>, said the recent
  improvement in oil prices was not enough for independent
  producers to begin new onshore drilling projects.
       ""If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlr
  per mcf for natural gas prevails, the prospects for onshore
  exploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by
  independents in the 1990s are pretty dismal,"" Walter said.
       He suggested that some independents may instead turn to
  exploration in shallow federal offshore leases. Farm-out
  agreements, cheap rig rates and less competition have held
  finding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel,
  Walter said.

  The Soviet economy has grown at an
  increased rate under Mikhail Gorbachev's leadership, but his
  goals may be too ambitious, according to a report from U.S.
  intelligence agencies.
      The report was prepared jointly by the Central Intelligence
  Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency for the
  Congressional Joint Economic committee, which released it.
      It said the Soviet economy grew by 4.2 pct in 1986,
  Gorbachev's first full year in power, twice the average rate of
  growth over the previous 10 years.
      Gorbachev's policies to improve worker attitudes, remove
  incompetent officials, reduce corruption and alcoholism and
  modernize the country's industrial equipment accounted for some
  of the gains, the report said.
      ""Although many of the specific policies Gorbachev has
  adopted are not new, the intensity Gorbachev has brought to his
  efforts and his apparent commitment to finding long-term
  solutions are attributes that his immediate predecessors
  lacked. Nonetheless, Gorbachev's program appears too ambitious
  on a number of counts,"" the report said.
      Earlier this week, two U.S. experts on the Soviet Union
  said Gorbachev was likely to be ousted in three to four years
  if he continues his reform policies.
      ""I don't think he can last four years,"" Marshall Goldman of
  Harvard University told a Congressional hearing. ""He's moving so
  fast, he's stepping on so many toes.""
      A similar comment came from Peter Reddaway of the
  Smithsonian Institution's Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian
  studies.
      The economic report said meeting targets for commodity
  output would require unrealistic gains in productivity and
  industrial output targets appear too high to allow time to
  install more advanced equipment.
      None of Gorbachev's proposals would change the system of
  economic incentives that has discouraged innovation and
  technological change, the report added.
      ""The first significant resistance to specific policies,
  although not overall goals, surfaced (in 1986) in both the
  massive government and party bureaucracy, particularly among
  enterprise managers who complained that they were being asked
  to carry out conflicting goals -- such as to raise quality
  standards and output targets simultaneously,"" the report said.
      The CIA-DIA report predicted two to three pct growth in the
  Soviet economy over the next several years. It said the Soviet
  Union trailed the U.S. by seven to 12 years in advanced
  manufacturing technologies, such as computers and
  microprocessors.

  The United States' emphasis on its
  foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's real
  problem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the General
  Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said.
       By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion
  dlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure
  which threatens the world trading system, it said in an annual
  report.
      The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federal
  budget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting government
  spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt,
  it said.
      GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct
  in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the
  previous two years.
      GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and
  instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current
  account payments deficit -- higher private savings, lower
  investment and a smaller federal budget deficit.
      Raising U.S. Trade barriers ""would result in little or no
  reduction in the current account deficit. It would, however,
  increase inflation and reduce world trade,"" it said.
      ""The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient
  domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would
  remain,"" the report said.
      GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year
  because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West
  European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a
  low dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third
  World debt management and looming protectionism.
      The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of
  Japan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986.
      The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes
  were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added.
      ""Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced
  as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not
  borne out last year,"" the report said.
      GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the
  U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly
  expanding money supply and low dollar.
      ""Such a development could worsen the business climate by
  increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in
  turn, would adversely affect world trade.""
      But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the
  United States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makes
  foreign products more expensive.
      It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human
  and in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the
  goods and services sought from abroad.
      World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986,
  about half of the rate of the previous year.
      Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct,
  continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT
  said.
      Developing countries' exports declined significantly, while
  their imports increased moderately, although full statistics
  are not available yet, GATT said.
      The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations
  were sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia,
  Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports.

  The Kenyan economy is heading for
  difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must
  tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging
  too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said.
      In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said
  high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth
  of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985.
      The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of
  payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in
  1985, he added.
      ""But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a
  result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange
  reserves during the year,"" he said.
      The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreign
  exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a
  peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986.
      Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a
  barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs.
      Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline
  in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more
  difficult to finance the government's budget deficit.
      Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on
  servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of
  capital for the first time in its history, he added.
      ""This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult
  phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that
  we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign
  sources to finance our development,"" he said.
      ""It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on
  expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the
  lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more
  frugal in satisfying immediate needs,"" the president added.

      They would give no details, noting that the White House had

      There was no immediate announcement on the council's

      The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for a

  last July governing trade in semiconductors.

  India is searching for non-communist
  countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
  conserve foreign exchange.
      Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and
  electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are
  all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,
  chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.
      Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in
  1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading
  Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).
      ""The two state trading corporations are free to use their
  buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
  exports,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that
  private firms are excluded from countertrading.
      One trade source said India has targetted countries that
  depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
  imports.
      However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part
  of India's total trading and are likely to account for less
  than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade
  during the nine months ended December, the sources said.
      Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65
  billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,
  against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.
      However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern
  Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.
      Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of
  agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude
  oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,
  against three billion in 1985/86.
      Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help
  narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still
  insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,
  Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.
      The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96
  billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion
  in the current fiscal year.
      But the push to include non-communist countries in
  countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow
  growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,
  shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.
      One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting
  countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made
  discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot
  officially support bartering.
      The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore
  exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.
      ""MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that
  preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind
  for goods and services sold to India,"" a trade official said,
  adding that the policy remains flexible.
      ""We also take into account other factors such as prices at
  which the goods and services are offered to India,"" the trade
  official said.
      Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign
  companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs
  and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance
  if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade
  sources said.
      Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean
  firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln
  dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.
      In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy
  Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pct
  sought by New Delhi, the trade official said.
      ""We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest,""
  he added.
      Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign
  currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to
  buy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in
  exchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars.
      But despite India's new drive, countertrade has some
  inherent problems, they added.
      ""It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that
  the trade should always be balanced,"" one trade source said. ""The
  other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy
  commodities which the other party wants.""
      Another added, ""Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it
  as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of
  payments difficulty.
      ""This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India.
  It does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy.""

  Philippine sugar production in the
  1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes,
  up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, Sugar
  Regulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said.
      Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current milling
  season, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimate
  would almost certainly be met.
      He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop would
  be earmarked for domestic consumption.
      Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for the
  U.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and
  50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market.
      He said if the government approved a long-standing SRA
  recommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would take
  up another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target.
      ""The government, for its own reasons, has been delaying
  approval of the project, but we expect it to come through by
  July,"" Yulo said.
      Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oil
  import bill by about 300 mln pesos.
      Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to
  start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved.
      The ethanol project would result in employment for about
  100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work by
  depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry.
      Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, had
  been submitted to President Corazon Aquino.
      ""I think the President would rather wait till the new
  Congress convenes after the May elections,"" he said. ""But there
  is really no need for such quotas. We are right now producing
  just slightly over our own consumption level.""
      ""The producers have never enjoyed such high prices,"" Yulo
  said, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos
  per picul, up from 190 pesos last August.
      Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation
  following the SRA's bid to control production.
      ""We are no longer concerned so much with the world market,""
  he said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned from
  their mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and
  cloth production.
      He said diversification into products other than ethanol
  was also possible within the sugar industry.
      ""The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons,"" Yulo said.
  ""They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but they
  relocated many of them and diversified production. We want to
  call this a 'sugarcane industry' instead of the sugar industry.""
      He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, used
  for thatching roofs, or used in room panelling.
      ""When you cut sugarcane you don't even have to produce
  sugar,"" he said.
      Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the
  International Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984.
      ""As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new
  agreement which would revive world prices,"" Yulo said.
      ""If there is no agreement world prices will always be
  depressed, particularly because the European Community is
  subsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets.""
      He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60
  cents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, where
  production costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound.
      ""If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents I
  expect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end
  of this year,"" he said.
      Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by
  1990, with world consumption outstripping production.
      He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments
  from artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup.
      ""But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration,"" he
  said. ""Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the
  U.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cut
  ours in half without any justification.""
      Manila was keenly watching Washington's moves to cut
  domestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents.
      The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its
  12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to
  143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986.
      Yulo said despite next year's increased production target,
  some Philippine mills were expected to shut down.
      ""At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the
  1986/87 season,"" he said. ""We expect two or three more to follow
  suit during the next season.""

      Girardin said the lira is expected to appreciate 14 pct

  Japan today announced another mammoth
  monthly trade surplus that economists said would be sure to
  intensify already mounting pressure on the country for action.
      ""The world has every reason to be furious with Japan for not
  moving more quickly,"" Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd economist
  Eric Rasmussen said.
      The Finance Ministry said today that the trade surplus
  soared to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion in
  January and 4.77 billion a year ago.
      The current account surplus, which includes trade in
  services as well as goods, climbed to 7.38 billion dlrs last
  month from 4.95 billion in January and 3.89 billion a year ago.
      After being adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, the figures
  look a bit better, but not much. On that basis, the trade
  surplus declined slightly in February to 9.16 billion dlrs from
  a record 9.58 billion in January.
      ""In the medium term we expect this modest improvement to
  continue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward off
  further protectionism or further yen strength,"" said William
  Stirling, economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.
      A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive on
  world markets while making imports into the country cheaper.
      ""On a seasonally adjusted basis, we appear to be making some
  progress on getting exports down,"" Jardine's Rasmussen said.
      But imports do not seem to be picking up much because the
  Japanese economy remains sluggish, he said.
      Finance Ministry officials blamed last month's slower
  import growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners worked
  off stocks they had built up in January.
      The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume of
  exports last month, after an unexpected year-on-year increase
  in January.
      This means the effects of the two-year rise of the yen
  against the U.S. Dollar are finally beginning to have an impact
  on exports, they said.
      But economists warned that may not be soon enough for
  Japan's trading partners.

      ""Japan has the means to make a major contribution to
  development in the Third World,"" he told about 500 Japanese
  businessmen and academics. ""I would be pleased with additional

      With 25 pct of the world's total banking assets, Japan
  could do more to help assist indebted Third World countries

      Conable said additional commercial bank investment would

      It would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplus

  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will
  visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S.
  Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats said
  they believed his chances of success were slim.
      Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and
  widespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will be
  hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S.
  President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said.
      News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided
  with news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus
  last month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier.
      It also came one day after the Reagan Administration's
  Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action
  against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint
  trade agreement on computer microchips.
      Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one
  designed to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in the
  short-term, the other to redirect the country in the medium
  term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth.
      But government officials said political infighting could
  rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent
  one from seeing the light of day.
      Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up
  a package of short-term economic measures until after its
  1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would
  amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate.
      But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for
  his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by
  opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan.
      Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the
  U.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling
  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own
  measures.
      He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis
  of the government's plans, without losing face in parliament
  over the budget, political analysts said.
      Officials working on the government's short-term economic
  package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on
  loans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to
  pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in
  the form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment.
      They said a record portion of state investment planned for
  the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first
  half, probably over 80 pct.
      Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy
  Reagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S.
  Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade
  deficit.
      To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also
  likely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term
  economic plans.
      A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan
  governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final
  report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days
  before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington.
      Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to
  Maekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are
  likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as
  agricultural reform and land policy, officials said.
      While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed
  as possible, they said the political realities might force them
  to water down some of the committee's recommendations.
      A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy
  might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes
  massive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee
  projects that the current account surplus will fall to less
  than two pct of Japan's total output, or gross national
  product, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, which
  measures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pct
  of gnp.
      The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for
  Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual
  appreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around
  1993, from 150 now.

      The median price of a home in January reached 100,700 dlrs
  -- the first time the price has exceeded 100,000 dlrs. That
  compared with a median price of 94,600 dlrs in December and
  94,000 dlrs in January a year ago.
      New homes available on the market in January totaled a
  seasonally adjusted 362,000 units, unchanged from December and
  equal to a 6.3 months' supply.
      The supply in December was 5.9 months.

  Reports the Soviet Union has lately
  extended its recent buying programme by taking five to eight
  raws cargoes from the free market at around 30/40 points under
  New York May futures highlight recent worldwide demand for
  sugar for a variety of destinations, traders said.
      The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India,
  Turkey and Libya, as well as possible raws offtake by China.
      Some 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes could have changed hands in
  current activity, which is encouraging for a sugar trade which
  previously saw little worthwhile end-buyer enquiry, they added.
      Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the Soviet
  Union in the past few days involved Japanese operators selling
  Thai origin sugar.
      Prices for nearby shipment Thai sugars have tightened
  considerably recently due to good Far Eastern demand, possibly
  for sales to the Soviet Union or to pre-empt any large block
  enquiries by China, they said.
      Thai prices for March/May 15 shipments have hardened to
  around 13/14 points under May New York from larger discounts
  previously, they added.
      Traders said the Soviet Union might be looking to buy more
  sugar in the near term, possibly towards an overall requirement
  this year of around two mln tonnes. It is probable that some
  1.8 mln tonnes have already been taken up, they said.
      Turkey was reported this week to have bought around 100,000
  tonnes of whites while India had further whites purchases of
  two to three cargoes for Mar/Apr at near 227 dlrs a tonne cost
  and freight and could be seeking more. Libya was also a buyer
  this week, taking two cargoes of whites which, for an
  undisclosed shipment period, were reported priced around
  229/230 dlrs a tonne cost and freight, they added.
      Futures prices reacted upwards to the news of end-buyer
  physicals offtake, although much of the enquiry emerged
  recently when prices took an interim technical dip, traders
  said.
      Pakistan is lined up shortly to buy 100,000 tonnes of
  whites although traders said the tender, originally scheduled
  for tomorrow, might not take place until a week later.
      Egypt will be seeking 20,000 tonnes of May arrival white
  sugar next week, while Greece has called an internal EC tender
  for 40,000 tonnes of whites to be held in early April, for
  arrival in four equal parts in May, June, July and August.

  A scheme to distribute surplus food
  free to the poor in the European Community (EC), which was due
  to expire next Tuesday, will be partially extended for a
  further month, an EC Commission spokesman said.
      He added the executive Commission has not yet decided
  whether the scheme should become a permanent feature of the
  EC's struggle to find a use for its massive stocks of farm
  produce.
      Almost 60,000 tonnes of cereals, sugar, beef, butter and
  other food have been authorised for distribution under an
  operation sanctioned by EC farm ministers on January 20 in
  which charities act as executive Commission agents.
      The original idea was to help the needy survive this year's
  unusually cold European winter.
      The spokesman said the Commission was extending the scheme
  fully in Greece, which has recently been hit by unseasonal
  snowstorms, for the month of April.
      Other EC countries would be authorised to use stocks of
  food for which they have already applied under the scheme up to
  April 30. The spokesman said this would enable distribution of
  flour, semolina, sugar and olive oil at a relatively high rate
  next month.
      He said the Commission, which has powers to continue most
  aspects of the scheme without consulting ministers further,
  will be considering soon whether it should be made permanent.
      Cost, which has already reached around 65 mln European
  currency units, would be a major consideration.
      End-January stocks included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter,
  520,000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals.

  India is searching for non-communist
  countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
  conserve foreign exchange.
      Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and
  electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are
  all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,
  chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.
      Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in
  1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading
  Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).
      ""The two state trading corporations are free to use their
  buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
  exports,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that
  private firms are excluded from countertrading.
      One trade source said India has targetted countries that
  depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
  imports.
      However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part
  of India's total trading and are likely to account for less
  than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade
  during the nine months ended December, the sources said.
      Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65
  billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,
  against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.
      However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern
  Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.
      Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of
  agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude
  oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,
  against three billion in 1985/86.
      Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help
  narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still
  insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,
  Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.
      The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96
  billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion
  in the current fiscal year.
      But the push to include non-communist countries in
  countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow
  growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,
  shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.
      One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting
  countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made
  discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot
  officially support bartering.
      The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore
  exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.
      ""MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that
  preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind
  for goods and services sold to India,"" a trade official said,
  adding that the policy remains flexible.
      ""We also take into account other factors such as prices at
  which the goods and services are offered to India,"" the trade
  official said.
      Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign
  companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs
  and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance
  if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade
  sources said.
      Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean
  firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln
  dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.

      For the 12 months ended in February, the CPI rose an

      Transportation prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5

      Housing prices rose 0.4 pct in February after a 0.5 pct

      Fuel oil prices were up 4.4 pct in February after
  increasing 9.8 pct in January, but were still 15 pct below
  price levels of February 1986.
      Food prices rose 0.2 pct last month after a 0.5 pct January

  Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou
  said today that the Greek armed froces were ready to tackle any
  aggressors following the sailing of a Turkish research vessel
  and warships towards disputed waters in the Aegean Sea.
      Papandreou told an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens ""the
  military readiness of our country is able now to give a very
  hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out
  military actions.""
      He said the activities of the research vessel could be
  aimed at partitioning the Aegean.
      ""The air force, navy and army are in a state of alert,""
  General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General
  Staff, told a news conference.
      He said the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an
  unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters
  in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning.
      Ergenc told Reuters later that all leave had been cancelled
  for members of the armed forces in the Aegean coast area.
      The Turkish government said yesterday it had licensed the
  state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corp to explore for oil in
  international waters around three Greek islands off Turkey.
       Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes over areas
  of the Aegean and the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus.
      The latest row erupted when the Greek government said last
  month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium
  which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos
  and would drill in the same area after the takeover.
      Ergenc told the news conference the alert followed a
  government decision that Turkey should protect its interests
  ""because of measures Greece has been taking in the Aegean in
  violation of international agreements.""
      Asked how Turkey would react if Greece attacked any of the
  vessels, he said ""If there is an attack, it is clear what has to
  be done. An attack on a warship is a cause for war."" But he
  added ""We are not in a state of war. The measures taken by the
  military are directed towards protecting our rights.""
      Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rights
  in the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of the
  dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
      Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp told
  reporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditions
  Athens had attached.
      In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if the
  Turkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations ""we will
  hinder it, of course not with words, as it cannot be stopped
  with words.""
      Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert and
  navy ships had gone to the Aegean. But government spokesman
  Yannis Roubatis did not confirm the move, saying only ""The Greek
  fleet is not at its naval base.""
      Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pct
  of the areas proposed for research were on the Greek
  continental shelf.
      Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a part
  in orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece to
  negotiate with Turkey, the Greek government would not accept
  it.
      Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will not
  negotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights in
  the Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus.
      He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not be
  possible for Greece to discuss the future of American military
  bases here. Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Bases
  in Greece in the event of war, Papandreou replied ""Obviously,
  and perhaps even before the war.""

  A final compromise proposal on cocoa
  buffer stock rules presented by International Cocoa
  Organization, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon is swiftly
  gaining acceptance by consumer and producer members, delegates
  said.
      ""We are close, nearer than ever to accepting it, but we
  still have some work to do,"" producer spokesman Mama Mohammed of
  Ghana told Reuters after a producers' meeting.
      European Community, EC, delegates said EC consumers
  accepted the package in a morning meeting and predicted ""no
  problems"" in getting full consumer acceptance.
      Delegates on both sides are keen to come to some agreement
  today, the last day of the fortnight-long council meeting, they
  said.
      The compromise requires that buffer stock purchases from
  non-ICCO member countries cannot exceed 15 pct of total buffer
  stock purchases, delegates said. The non-member cocoa issue has
  been among the most contentious in the rules negotiations.
      The 15 pct figure, up five percentage points from earlier
  proposals, represents a concession to consumers, delegates
  said. They have demanded a larger allowance for non-member
  cocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted.
      Another problem area, delegates said, was the question of
  price differentials for different origins of cocoa bought into
  the buffer stock, by which the buffer stock manager could
  fairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered to
  him.
      The compromise narrowed the range of differentials between
  the origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a move
  some delegates described as ""just fiddling.""
      But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appease
  some countries that were not satisfied with the original
  proposed differentials assigned to them, delegates said.
      The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any
  day would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate or
  forward positions, delegates said.
      If the compromise is accepted by the council, most
  consumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect
  next week, or as soon as practically possible.
      The full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 GMT to
  discuss the compromise, and could agree on it then if all
  parties are satisfied, they said. Consumers are due to meet
  before the council.

      Officials said another option now being considered by the
  U.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japanese
  institutions. That could be done under the government's
  proposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament.
      58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal
  in London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-based
  firms are authorised to do financial business, officials said.
      The new financial services and banking acts offer Britain
  an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied
  under legally-binding international trade agreements.
      ""The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and Industry
  Secretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging in
  investment, banking and insurance,"" one official said.
      ""This point has been made to the Japanese at official level
  a number times,"" the official added.
      Britain and France are now working together to urge that
  the European Community take collective action against Japan,
  but by working within EC treaties, another official said.
      British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radio
  interview that the European Community should build barriers
  against Japanese imports through certification procedures
  similar to those facing European exporters in Japan.
      ""There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer,"" he
  said, adding ""(such barriers) can't be put in place overnight.""
  Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade
  ""strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have a
  fair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which is
  itself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of our
  own domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness.""
      The situation is only likely to worsen following news that
  Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more
  than 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrs
  from 5.7 billion in January, political sources said.
      But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visible
  trade and access to financial markets should be kept separate.
      Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financial
  institutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, rather
  than larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a global
  business centre, government sources said. Japan's four largest
  securities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange.
      In Washington, White House officials said President Reagan
  was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for
  breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States.
      There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on
  the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb
  Japanese exports to the United States but officials said the
  move could come today or early next week.
      Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan
  included tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which
  use semiconductors.

  The Agriculture Department's
  widening of Louisiana gulf differentials will affect county
  posted prices for number two yellow corn in ten states, a USDA
  official said.
      All counties in Iowa will be affected, as will counties
  which use the gulf to price corn in Illinois, Indiana,
  Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama
  and Louisiana, said Ron Burgess, Deputy Director of Commodity
  Operations Division for the USDA.
      USDA last night notified the grain industry that effective
  immediately, all gulf differentials used to price interior corn
  would be widened on a sliding scale basis of four to eight cts,
  depending on what the differential is.
      USDA's action was taken to lower excessively high posted
  county prices for corn caused by high gulf prices.
      ""We've been following this Louisiana gulf situation for a
  month, and we don't think it's going to get back in line in any
  nearby time,"" Burgess said.
      Burgess said USDA will probably narrow back the gulf
  differentials when and if Gulf prices recede. ""If we're off the
  mark now because we're too high, wouldn't we be as much off the
  mark if we're too low?"" he said.
      While forecasting more adjustments if Gulf prices fall,
  Burgess said no other changes in USDA's price system are being
  planned right now.
      ""We don't tinker. We don't make changes lightly, and we
  don't make changes often,"" he said.

  Drought has resulted in a reduction
  in China's estimated wheat crop this year to 87.0 mln tonnes,
  2.0 mln below last year's harvest, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department's officer in Peking said in a field report.
      The report, dated March 25, said imports in the 1987/88
  season are projected at 8.0 mln tonnes, 1.0 mln tonnes above
  the the current season's estimate.
      Imports from the United States are estimated at 1.5 mln
  tonnes compared to only 150,000 tonnes estimated for the
  1986/87 year, it said.
      After travelling to major wheat producing areas and
  obtaining more information on the planted area, the total
  planted area was estimated down 290,000 hectares due to the dry
  fall, it said.
      The report said to compensate for the below normal
  precipitation irrigation has increased as has the use of
  fertilizer.
      While there are pockets where irrigation is not possible,
  most of the wheat crop has access to some water and therefore
  has emerged from dormancy and is doing well, the report said.
      It said scattered rain in many parts of China in the past
  10 days has improved the situation but information on hail
  damage in Anhui is incomplete.

  The International Cocoa Organization
  (ICCO) Council reached agreement on rules to govern its buffer
  stock, the device it uses to keep cocoa off the market to
  stabilise prices, ICCO delegates said.
      The date on which the new rules will take effect has not
  been decided but delegates said they expected them to come into
  force early next week, after which the buffer stock manager can
  begin buying or selling cocoa.
      Since prices are below the ""may-buy"" level of 1,655 Special
  Drawing Rights a tonne set in the cocoa pact, the manager is
  likely to buy cocoa sooon to support the market, they said.
      Delegates and traders said they expected the manager,
  Juergen Plambeck, to intervene in the market within three weeks
  of the pact coming into force.
      The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins or
  the second hand market on an offer system, not by means of a
  posted price as in the previous cocoa accord.
      The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set of
  differentials, ranging from 137 stg for most expensive Ghana
  cocoa to zero for Malaysian cocoa.
      Purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will be
  limited to 15 pct of the total stock and those on any one day
  should be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate and
  forward positions.
      The council meeting, which is expected to conclude two
  weeks of sessions involving various working groups and the
  council itself, was continuing, the delegates said.
      The current cocoa agreement came into force on January 20
  during a previous meeting of the council which was unable to
  agree on the rules to implement buffer stock operations.

  The South African Reserve Bank,
  confirming previous estimates, said real gross domestic product
  in the 1986 fourth quarter grew at a seasonally adjusted annual
  rate of 4.7 pct versus 4.6 pct in the third quarter and 1.3 pct
  in the 1985 final quarter.
      The bank, in its latest quarterly review, said the nominal
  growth rate for the year did not quite reach one pct after a
  1.5 pct contraction in 1985.
      But it said when the strengthening of the terms of trade is
  taken into account, the real GNP in 1986 advanced by 1.5 pct
  compared with a decrease of 0.5 pct in 1985.
      GDP is the total value of goods and services produced by an
  economy but omits income from abroad.  GNP includes such
  payments or outflows.
      The bank also said there were indications the country's
  economic recovery was becoming more broadly based.
      With the exception of commerce all major sectors of the
  economy contributed to the fourth quarter rise in domestic
  production.
      The bank said major increases in foreign reserves were
  recorded in January, February and the first half of March 1987.
  Reserves rose by 1.70 billion rand during January and February.
      Total reserves in 1986 declined by 189 mln rand to 5.70
  billion rand and were equivalent to about 14.5 pct of the total
  annual value of import payments.
      The current account surplus amounted to 7.20 billion rand
  in 1986 versus 5.90 mln the previous year.
      The bank said continuing strength of the current account
  has allowed foreign reserves to be ""rebuilt to more comfortable
  levels.""

  support to the exchange rate of the rand if such action were to

  U.S. cotton farmers are likely to
  plant about 10.6 mln acres in the coming season, based on an
  average of estimates offered by cotton market analysts gearing
  up for the U.S. Agriculture Department's 1987 planting
  intentions report next Tuesday.
      The annual report gives cotton traders their first glimpse
  of what U.S. production might be in the 1987/88 season, which
  begins August 1.
      Trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 10.2 to
  10.9 mln acres.
      On March 18 of last year, the USDA reported that cotton
  farmers in 1986 intended to plant 9.71 mln acres.
      Four months later, the USDA estimated that 9.67 mln acres
  had been planted as of June 1. By January, its estimate of 1986
  planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln.
      Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in
  1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year's good
  demand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analysts
  said those factors make cotton a profitable crop.
      ""With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there is
  going to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton.
  Soybeans are dirt cheap,"" said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill
  Investor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cotton
  market specialists.
      Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead to
  increased acreage, analysts said.
      They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmers
  who used part of their crop as collateral for government loans
  were not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in
  government warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the government
  will not pick up the tab for storage.
      Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from
  participating in the program, which could result in more
  cotton. ""The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of
  25 pct of a farmer's base acreage,"" noted Judy Weissman of
  Shearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not to
  participate in the program are free to plant all the acreage 
  they have.
      Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yielding
  Western states would be most likely to steer clear of the
  program. ""Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct,"" said
  one commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in part
  on forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its
  annual meeting in late January.
      But others disagreed. ""I think some Western growers have
  decided they should be in the program for security reasons.
  There's a lot of comfort in knowing you'll be guaranteed the
  government's loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside the
  program is subject to the wiles of the market,"" said Walter
  Brown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer.
      Some cotton specialists said their expectations for
  increased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday's planting
  intentions report. ""Anything the USDA is announcing now is
  based on information they gathered before their cotton program
  was announced (on March 20),"" one analyst cautioned. She said
  traders will get a better idea of next year's cotton output
  when the USDA's planted acreage report is released on July 9.
      Brown took that opinion a step further. ""I don't think
  planted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonment
  rate,"" the difference between acreage planted and acreage
  harvested.
      Brown said the abandonment rate this year was ""pretty high""
  at 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producing
  states. ""More normal would be about six pct,"" he said.

  U.S. inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will be
  above last year's pace, economists said.
      ""Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this time
  last year, but it's not building up a large head of steam,""
  said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.
      U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the consumer price
  index for all urban consumers, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4
  pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain. Energy prices,
  which fired January's data with a three pct rise, advanced a
  more moderate 1.9 pct last month.
      The CPI came within the range of economists' expectations
  and had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets.
      Among the key components of the report, transportation
  prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gain
  reflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels and
  declines in new car prices and finance charges.
      ""There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,""
  said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
      Economists said the latest CPI supports existing
  expectations for an inflation rate of 3.5 to four pct in 1987.
      The CPI rose 1.1 pct from December 1985 to December 1986.
  Without last year's energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct.
      Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as a
  result of the dollar's drop as well as the volatile energy
  component warrant attention in case gains in these areas become
  factored into the wider economic picture.
      ""As long as those price rises do not become entrenched in
  cost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thus
  reducing international competitiveness, then the Federal
  Reserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pct
  inflation,"" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.

  Consumer energy costs rose 1.9 pct
  in February following a sharp rise last month, the Labor
  Department said.
      The February increase in the overall energy costs,
  including petroleum, coal and natural gas, followed a 0.2 pct
  drop in December and a 3.0 pct rise in January, it said.
      Energy prices were 12.2 pct below year-ago levels.
      The department's Consumer Price Index showed that the cost
  of gasoline rose in February by 4.2 pct, after a 6.6 pct rise
  in January.
      Gasoline prices were nonetheless 18.0 pct below their
  levels as of February 1986.
      Also, the category including fuel oil, coal and bottled gas
  rose in February by 3.8 pct, putting it 14.9 pct under the
  year-ago figure.
      The index also showed that natural gas and electricity were
  unchanged last month, but down 3.5 pct from the February 1986
  figure, the department said.
      The index has been updated  o reflect 1982-84 consumption
  patterns; previously, the index was based on 1972-73 patterns.

  A cold air mass working its way
  south from Canada may pose a threat to developing hard red
  winter wheat in Oklahoma, according to Eugene Krenzler, wheat
  specialist for the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension.
      ""There is some threat. Some of the crop is far enough along
  so that it's probably vulnerable,"" Krenzler said.
      Accu Weather meteorologist Dale Mohler said cold air moving
  from the north could put temperatures in the middle 20's
  fahrenheit as early as tonight, depending on development of a
  low pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall the
  system.
      If impeded by the low-pressure area, the cold air could hit
  Oklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning. Temperatures
  could stay in the mid-20's for up to eight hours, Mohler said.
      Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crop
  has advanced to boot stage. The closer to that stage the more
  vulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather, he said.
      ""We can handle probably an hour or so down to 25 or 26
  degrees (fahrenheit),"" Krenzler said, ""as long as we don't have
  a lot of wind.""
      ""If we do get six hours down below 25 degrees I'd say we
  have a good chance of significant damage to the heads,"" he
  said.
      Krenzler said early planted stands in the north-central and
  southwestern parts of the state are probably most vulnerable.
  Crops in the panhandle of Oklahoma and Texas are less developed
  and have some snow cover protection from the cold, he noted.

  Japanese computer chip makers reacted
  angrily to news the United States plans to take retaliatory

      Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) Chairman
  Shoichi Saba stated: ""EIAJ believes that it is premature and
  even irrational to attempt an assessment of the impact of the
  agreement and our efforts to comply with it only six months
  after concluding the agreement.""
      ""We urge U.S. Governmental authorities to reconsider the
  decision made, to evaluate fairly the results of Japanese

      Yesterday, Washington announced plans to slap as much as

      The agreement, struck late last year after months of heated

  on world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.
      To salvage the pact, Tokyo has instructed its chip makers

      Saba said that Japanese chip companies have pledged three

  aircraft headed for the Aegean.
      He and other political leaders spoke of qualified optimism
  following a statement by Turkish Premier Turgut Ozal last night
  that the research vessel would not enter disputed waters as
  previously annnounced unless Greek vessels did so.
      The Prime Minister declined to answer reporters' questions

  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded
  a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the
  United States over trade in computer microchips.
      ""Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by
  explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that
  need to be corrected,"" he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as
  saying.
      While expressing regret over America's decision to impose
  tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said
  Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington
  to help settle the dispute.
      Government officials said Japan would make a formal request
  next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would
  probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17
  deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect.
      Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan
  investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are
  dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets.
      Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300
  mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic
  goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to
  live up to their bilateral chip pact.
      That agreement, hammered out late last year after months of
  heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price
  chips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips.
      Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory
  than those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura,
  who earlier today said Japan was ready to take ""appropriate
  measures"" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions.
      Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
  officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura's
  remark and said that his main message was that the two sides
  need to talk urgently about the issue.
      But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the
  United States to GATT, the Geneva-based international
  organization which polices world trade, if Washington imposed
  the tariffs.
      Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article
  23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they
  said. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panel
  to consider the legality of the U.S. Action.
      But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. ""It
  may be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the United
  States may lift its decision at an early date,"" Tamura said.
      In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, President
  Ronald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had
  evidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in world
  markets and had opened up its own market to imports.
      Japanese government officials said they are confident they
  can make the pact work.
      They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chips
  through unregulated distributors has all but dried up after
  MITI instructed domestic makers to cut output.
      While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japanese
  imports of American chips, MITI officials said that the
  ministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens.
      The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users,
  some of whom are also leading producers, to step up their
  purchases of foreign semiconductors.
      A spokesman for one of the companies, Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T>
  said his firm would do just that and could announce its plans
  in the next week or so. He expects other Japanese companies to
  do likewise.

      Despite the end of the crisis, Turkish officials

  The Emirates Industrial Bank has
  predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states
  following higher oil revenues.
      A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said
  total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
  countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from
  33.5 billion in 1986.
      The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia
  and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
      The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil
  prices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain
  overall group production.
      These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight
  dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs.
      ""All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in
  the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected
  growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,""
  the study said.
      It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher
  budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past
  recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts.
      The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise
  to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year.
      It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined
  trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in
  1985.

      Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca
  was in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO)
  executive board producer members after a meeting last weekend
  in Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers to
  discuss the fall in coffee prices.
      London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to
  1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February.
      Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failed
  to agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results on
  Latin America, both economically and politically.
      He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers to
  pave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September.
      Coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices under
  an International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago
  when prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil.
      Central American economic ministers have estimated the
  region will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in
  1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement,
  Martinez said.
      He said ICO quota talks broke down last month because
  consumer members lack the political will to fully support
  commodity agreements, and because consumers tried to dictate to
  producers.

  Japan is seeking to prevent its computer
  chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale
  trade war, government officials said.
      ""We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have
  an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United
  States,"" a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
  official said.
       On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300
  mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's
  alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact.
      That agreement, reached last year after heated
  negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips
  in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.
      Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the
  fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime
  Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the
  end of April.
      While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure
  the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures
  it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure
  the trip's success, they said.
      ""The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,""
  one official told Reuters. ""We would very much like to do
  something to respond to that.""
      In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from
  spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the
  U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor
  makers, not to the government.
      Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an
  angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been
  forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor
  dispute, trade analysts said.
      They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest
  chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the
  draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact,
  included enforced production cuts.
      The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the
  announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties
  the government faces in taking further action.
      ""Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the
  U.S./Japan agreement,"" said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the
  Electronic Industries Association of Japan.
      He accused the U.S. Of being ""irrational."" He said the U.S.
  Action had made the bilateral chip pact ""meaningless.""
      Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute
  through consultations.
      Japan is expected to send a high-level official to
  Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to
  go ahead with the tariffs on April 17.
      Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry
  plans to step up purchases of U.S. Chips and to propose a joint
  investigation into Washington's allegations of chip dumping.

  The U.S. Expects more harmonious
  talks than usual during French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's
  first official visit this week as frequently rancorous disputes
  between the two countries begin to fade.
      ""The Libyan bombing is a thing of the past, the trade war
  didn't happen and we have reached reasonably good cooperation
  on terrorism,"" one U.S. Official told Reuters.
      ""It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect,
  more harmonious than usual.""
      Since taking office a year ago, Chirac has been obliged to
  deal with a series of potentially serious disputes with the
  United States.
      During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets in
  Libya last April, France refused to allow British-based U.S.
  Planes to overfly its territory, forcing them to take a
  circuitous route. That angered Washington.
      The U.S. Officials, who asked not to be identified, said a
  year ago Washington felt the French were not taking strong
  enough action against terrorism. ""Now they are. We're pleased
  and they are pleased that we are pleased,"" one said.
      More recently, a dispute over U.S. Access to the grain
  markets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the European
  Community  threatened to become a trade war.
      In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberate
  Community moves to exclude U.S. Grain, the United States was
  poised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community food
  imports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute.
      Last week, the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad,
  supported, trained and armed by Paris and Washington, scored a
  major success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last bases
  in northern Chad.
      A French official added: ""There is also a common interest in
  getting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of the
  world by opening up its markets.""
      Although relations have improved markedly between the two
  countries, many irritants remain. At the top of the list is the
  Community's common agricultural policy (CAP).
      To Washington, as one official put it, ""CAP is the root of
  all evil"" in international food trade because it subsidises
  farmers and sells vast amounts of excess produce at below world
  prices, thereby eating into U.S. Markets.

  The United States and Japan will
  soon settle their trade dispute over semiconductors, U.S.
  Commerce secretary Malcolm Baldrige said on television.
      Baldrige, referring to the U.S.-Japan trade agreement on
  semiconductors, said: ""Their government wants to live up to it.
  Their industries haven't been doing it, and I think we'll have
  a good settlement to spare both sides.""
      ""I think the Japanese understand full well that they haven't
  lived up to this commitment,"" he said.
      He added: ""I do not think there will be a trade war at all.""
      On Friday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300
  mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods from April 17,
  because of Tokyo's failure to observe the agreement.
      The officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon as
  Japan started adhering to the agreement. But they said there
  was little chance Japan could react quickly enough to avert the
  higher tariffs.
      Baldrige said the Reagan administration hoped the strong
  U.S. Action against Japan would convince Congress to tone down
  protectionist trade legislation now being drafted.
      He denied the action had been taken for that reason.

  Dry areas of the Australian sugar cane

      The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago, but
  rainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains are

      Elsewhere, in the far north and the far south of the state

  Indonesia has minimised the economic
  impact of falling oil prices, kept inflation within limits and
  boosted exports, Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said.
      Indonesia was badly hit by last year's steep plunge in
  crude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half.
      But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling
  President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in
  the financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct the
  previous year.
      Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said,
  although he did not give complete figures.
      The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general
  elections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber,
  palm oil, tin, timber and coffee.
      Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of the
  appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against
  the dollar, which increased Indonesia's debt repayments.
      He said the economy would have suffered more from the world
  economic recession if the government had not devalued the
  rupiah by 31 pct last September.
      In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Post
  said the government must press ahead with measures to
  deregulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports.
      The English-language daily said bigger export earnings were
  needed to finance not only imports but also the country's
  growing foreign debt, estimated at around 37 billion dlrs.
      ""About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due

  The Japanese government appears to have
  little new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Over
  computer chips, trade analysts and government officials said.
      The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300
  mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., In
  retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on the
  microchip trade signed last September.
      A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters ""Japan has done
  what it can, and now we must persuade the United States to wait
  for those steps to take effect.""
      The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the September
  agreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in
  non-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S.
  Chip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17.
       Analysts noted Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
  Industry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cut
  production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in
  third countries at non-regulated prices.
      ""I'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has,"" said
  Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards.
      A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call
  for production cuts beyond those already sought, although it
  would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods.
      Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they
  would consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a Matsushita
  Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in
  imports was not likely.
      Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if
  the United States did implement the tariffs, which would be
  levied on consumer electronics products rather than on
  microchips themselves.
      ""If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time,
  there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,""
  said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co.
      ""The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be
  stopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be
  delayed for another year,"" he said.
      Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by
  stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan
  for semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here.
      ""The American approach is full of contradictions,"" Jardine
  Fleming's Edwards said.
      ""If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing they
  want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that
  hurts the final market,"" Edwards said.
      But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S.
  Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also
  frustration with Japan's vast trade surplus. Some analysts
  argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have
  to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact.
      Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd,
  said ""The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic
  economy and move away from an export-dependent economy.""

  Sri Lanka will uproot rubber trees that
  are more than two years old and affected by the leaf disease
  corynespora, the head of the government's Rubber Research
  Institute told Reuters.
      Rodney De Mel said affected trees less than two years old
  would undergo base-budding -- attaching a clone as close as
  possible to the trunk's base and cutting off the top of the
  tree once the bud has taken. Uprooted or base-budded trees
  mature later, causing an output loss estimated at 350 kilos per
  hectare from the sixth year when they begin producing.
      About 7,000 acres are planted with the high yielding RIC
  103 variety, the clone afflicted by corynespora.
      Only about 2,000 acres are affected by the disease, which
  causes leaves to fall off, De Mel said.
      Sri Lanka has 508,000 acres planted with rubber trees.
      De Mel said the disease was detected in nurseries as early
  as in middle 1985, but it was only in August-September 1986
  that it became widespread.
      The Institute is conducting a survey to determine how many
  trees will be uprooted or base-budded. Healthy trees will be
  sprayed and remain under observation.
      T.P. Lilaratne, head of the government's Rubber Controller
  Department, which monitors the industry, told Reuters
  replanting and base-budding would have to be undertaken before
  late May when the monsoon rains begin.
      De Mel said clones in the nurseries which are susceptible
  to corynespora, identified as RIC 103, RIC 52, RIC 104, RIC
  106, RIC 107 and RIC 118, will be uprooted and burned.
      The same procedures will be undertaken for the foreign
  clones indentified as NAB 12, RRIM 725, FX25, PPN 2444, PPN
  2447, KRS 21 and PPN 2058.
      Lilaratne said the susceptible clones would be replaced by
  PB 86, RRIM 600, RRIC 110, RRIC 121, RIC 100 and RIC 102.
      These six varieties would also be used to replace trees
  uprooted or base-budded, De Mel said.
      Lilaratne said planters would receive 10,000 rupees per
  hectare for replanting and plants would be free of charge.
      ""But no compensation is contemplated at the moment,"" he
  added.
      De Mel said a drought in Sri Lanka has helped control the
  spread of the disease.
      ""The drought has not stopped the disease, but probably
  helped in some way because trees have not been affected in
  areas that are dry,"" he said.
      Brokers said the disease had not affected prices because it
  has not caused a drop in production.

  The buffer stock rules agreement reached
  on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) is an
  improvement on previous arrangements but the price-support
  mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa
  prices, many ICCO delegates and trade sources said.
      The accord was reached between producers and consumers of
  the 35-member ICCO council after two weeks of talks.
      European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the
  accord may boost cocoa prices immediately, but world surpluses
  overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long.
      ""If the buffer stock operation is successful, I doubt it
  will do anything more than stop the price from falling further,
  and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate
  prices,"" a European dealer said.
      And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying,
  or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market
  is relying on him to do so, the bearish trade reaction could
  pressure prices dramatically, dealers said.
      The buffer stock is the market-regulating tool of the ICCO,
  into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to
  manoeuvre prices into a pre-set stabilization range.
      A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but
  delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time.
      The new rules take effect immediately. The buffer stock
  manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three
  weeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producing
  countries and assessing the market, since prices are below the
  ""must-buy"" level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne
  specified in the agreement, the sources said.
      The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum
  100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach will
  be more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said.
      The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a
  buying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes of
  which are already in the buffer stock.
      ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister
  Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of
  stabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa
  producer.
      ""We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw
  immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market,"" Bra Kanon
  told reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckoned
  the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000
  tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee.
      However, some producer and consumer members emerged from
  the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the
  pact.
      Ghana, whose high-quality cocoa is the world's most
  expensive and provides 60 pct of the country's export earnings,
  made a formal protest to the council about the price
  differentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too high
  for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock.
      According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West
  Germany, ""Consumers weren't perfectly happy with the buffer
  stock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...There
  were no real winners or losers.""
      Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that
  important points were fully discussed during the talks, and as
  a result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as
  effectively as they could have, delegates said.
      Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seek
  offers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials to
  reflect different qualities. Non-ICCO member cocoa can comprise
  up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock.
      London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg per
  tonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stg
  in January 1986.
      A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000
  tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session
  decides market conditions warrant it, according to the
  agreement.
      The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall
  below the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five
  days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has
  been filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says.
      The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an
  executive committee meeting on June 9/12, ICCO officials said.

  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded
  a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the
  United States over trade in computer microchips.
      ""Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by
  explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that
  need to be corrected,"" he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as
  saying.
      While expressing regret over America's decision to impose
  tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said
  Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington
  to help settle the dispute.
      Government officials said Japan would make a formal request
  next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would
  probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17
  deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect.
      Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan
  investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are
  dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets.
      On Friday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300
  mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic
  goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to
  live up to their bilateral chip pact.

"training/10771";"International_Trade";"3";"JAPAN ISOLATED, YEN RISES, WORLD FEELS CHEATED
  Japan is becoming dangerously isolated
  again as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by
  Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth,
  officials and businessmen from around the world said.
      As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen,
  making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments
  grit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
  there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise.
      The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by
  both sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year.
      The document was prepared by a private committee formed by
  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of
  Japan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction
  due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must ""make a historical
  transformation in its traditional policies on economic
  management and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no further
  development for Japan without this transformation.""
      Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have
  looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the
  Japanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term
  prospects of totally transforming their economic habits.
      The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese
  prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to
  raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to
  the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral
  semiconductor pact.
      British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to
  block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese
  placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid
  by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic
  telecommunications joint venture.
      On Friday, European currency dealers said European central
  banks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might
  leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.
      Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group
  Keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory
  views last November when he visited the European Community.
  ""Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I
  found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe
  was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the
  results of the Maekawa report,"" he said.
      ""We explained that the process of restructuring the economy
  away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between
  domestic and external demand...Would take time,"" Saito said.
      Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial
  Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said ""I
  only know that your government, under the leadership of
  Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less
  outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa
  report which has attracted the most attention in Europe.""
      And Europeans and Americans want quick action. ""A far better
  answer than protectionism would be structural change within the
  Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And
  we hope to see changes occur in the near future,"" visiting
  Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.
      Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the
  fault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of
  change in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.
      Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business
  leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade
  problem.
      ""We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the
  Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,""
  said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.
      ""The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it
  is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their
  labour,"" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of
  Shearson Lehman Brothers.
      Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.
      Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as
  fast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled
  the country asking about this issue.
      He said People mentioned many things in line with the
  spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and
  steel industries.
      A major misunderstanding is that the private report was
  government policy. Europeans are confused about this,
  underlined by von Moltke's reference to the ""leadership"" of the
  Maekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last
  September's government programme of new economic measures.
  ""Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out
  that the government has put its signature to a programme
  designed to implement the report,"" the ambassador said.

  Japan is seeking to prevent its computer
  chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale
  trade war, government officials said.
      ""We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have
  an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United
  States,"" a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
  official said.
       On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300
  mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's
  alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact.
      That agreement, reached last year after heated
  negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips
  in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.
      Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the
  fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime
  Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the
  end of April.
      While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure
  the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures
  it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure
  the trip's success, they said.
      ""The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,""
  one official told Reuters. ""We would very much like to do
  something to respond to that.""
      In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from
  spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the
  U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor
  makers, not to the government.
      Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an
  angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been
  forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor
  dispute, trade analysts said.
      They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest
  chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the
  draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact,
  included enforced production cuts.
      The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the
  announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties
  the government faces in taking further action.
      ""Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the
  U.S./Japan agreement,"" said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the
  Electronic Industries Association of Japan.
      He accused the U.S. of being ""irrational."" He said the U.S.
  action had made the bilateral chip pact ""meaningless.""
      Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute
  through consultations.
      Japan is expected to send a high-level official to
  Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to
  go ahead with the tariffs on April 17.
      Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry
  plans to step up purchases of U.S. chips and to propose a joint
  investigation into U.S. allegations of chip dumping.

  In a bid to hasten Japan's promise
  to speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreign
  trade, top U.S. officials appear once again to have signaled
  their tolerance of a lower dollar.
      Treasury Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides,
  Assistant Secretary David Mulford, said last week there was no
  target for the dollar, a statement that sent the yen soaring
  against the dollar, despite massive central bank intervention.
      ""That was no slip of the tongue,"" said one western monetary
  official, who asked not to be identified.
      For now, the strategy appears to be working. Japanese
  officials said late last week a package to bolster domestic
  demand will be ready in early April. Until last week, there
  were few indications the package would be ready anytime soon.
      The Reagan administration, facing an uproar in Congress
  over the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 169.8 billion
  dlr trade deficit, is learning now that to extract results from
  Japan, dramatic action is required.
      Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs on
  certain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhere
  to a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries.
      The shift in U.S. strategy, in part designed to appease
  mounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies, comes just
  two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review
  the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies.
      And news that Japan earned a record 18 billion dlr trade
  surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the
  need for urgent action, in the view of U.S. officials.
      Nonetheless, U.S. officials see signs of improvement in the
  deficit. ""I'd be stunned if we were not going to derive some
  benefits (from the lower dollar) soon,"" said one.
      In Paris, leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate
  closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting
  ""underlying economic fundamentals"" or economic reality.
      The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japan
  and West Germany stimulating their economies and the United
  States cutting its budget deficit.
      The three nations, joined by France, Britain and Canada,
  agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade
  imbalances.
      But analysts say markets have signalled the underlying
  fundamentals imply a lower dollar, rather than a stable one.
      Markets, in effect, are less confident than governments
  that these measures -- including U.S. budget deficit cuts
  agreed by Congress and the White House --will be carried out.
      Nonetheless, the dollar's sharp fall has not undermined 
  cooperation. A U.S. economic policymaker said the accord was on
  track and Tokyo and Bonn seem ""to want more stimulative measures
  which is what the Paris accord calls for.""
      International monetary sources said exchange market
  developments generally have not unsettled policymakers,
  although Japan is an obvious exception. ""Everybody feels it can
  still be managed,"" one source said of market developments.
      But last week, the Bank of Japan spent an estimated five
  billion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen, and other
  central banks about one billion dlrs.
      Another monetary source said Japan was upset with America's
  half-hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar, flouting the
  Paris accord outright.
      The source, close to the top levels of Japanese economic
  policymaking, said Japan's understanding of the accord was that
  the yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar, the level it
  stood at when the accord was struck.
      The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washington's
  use of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies. It was a
  ""pointed reminder"" to Japan to do something about the trade
  issues, the source said of the dollar's fall against the yen.
      By departing last Sunday from the language of the Paris
  accord -- that nations agreed to foster currency stability
  around current levels -- Baker triggered a run on the dollar.
      Later in the week, Mulford too said there was no target for
  the dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up to
  their international responsibilities and stimulate growth.
      But U.S. officials said recent market developments will not
  unravel the spirit of the Paris agreement.
      ""There's a realisation now that you cannot leave things
  alone, everyone agrees that the external (trade) imbalances
  ought to be adjusted,"" one official said.
      ""While no-one is going to cede national sovereignty, we
  certainly seem to be moving towards much closer co-operation,""
  another U.S. official said.
      The officials said the meeting here, where the six will be
  joined by Italy, will be a status report.
      ""Japan will have to explain what the state of their program
  is and Germany will report on its plans. Maybe there's a need
  to move faster,"" one source said.
      Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called, in
  effect, for currency stability for several months. This would
  buy time for Japan and West Germany to speed up their economic
  growth and help bring down the U.S. trade deficit.
      His comments appeared to serve notice on other major
  nations that Washington cannot wait too long for action to
  reduce the gap between the Japanese and German trade surpluses
  and the U.S. trade deficit.

  The United States and Japan will

      Baldrige, referring to the U.S.-Japan trade agreement on
  semiconductors, said: ""Their government wants to live up to it.
  Their industries haven't been doing it, and I think we'll have
  a good settlement to spare both sides.""
      ""I think the Japanese understand full well that they haven't

      On Friday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300

  because of Tokyo's failure to observe the agreement.
      The officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon as
  Japan started adhering to the agreement. But they said there
  was little chance Japan could react quickly enough to avert the
  higher tariffs.
      Baldrige said the Reagan administration hoped the strong
  U.S. Action against Japan would convince Congress to tone down

  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has
  withdrawn a request to Washington to suspend operations at an
  American army base near Athens as a Greek-Turkish row over oil
  rights in the Aegean eased.
      A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened to
  tackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea kept
  to Turkish territorial waters yesterday, avoiding a potential
  clash.
      Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefing
  opposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday.
      The Greek government later withdrew Friday's request to

  prompted it to make the request were no longer valid.
      Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece has
  the right to ask for suspension of operations at times when its
  national interests are threatened.
      The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it would
  search for oil round three Greek islands off its coast
  following an announcement from Greece that it planned to drill
  east of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-led
  oil consortium operating in the northern Aegean.
      Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreement
  under which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in the
  Aegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled.
  Athens says it considers the accord inactive.
      The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had
  received an assurance from Greece that it would not carry out
  oil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declined
  comment on the statement.
      Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take the
  long-standing continental shelf dispute to the International
  Court of Justice at The Hague.

  other cereals were required, it said, along with supplies of
  sugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.
      In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha
  (October 1986-April 1987) crop had been ""almost completely
  devastated,"" the letter said. Maha paddy output was now
  estimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originally
  expected.
      There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a high
  forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate
  rainfall within the next three to four weeks.
      ""Should the present drought continue, however, production is
  estimated at around 20 mln bushels,"" the letter added.
      Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90
  and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Last
  year's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.
      The letter said villagers in most seriously affected
  districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because
  subsidiary crops had also failed.
      It said the government's current budget did not permit it
  to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected.
  ""Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity
  prices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continue
  to exert pressure on the expenditure side.""
      The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per
  month for each family, as well as handling, transport and
  distribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds by
  the government would not be possible without seriously
  impairing development projects, or ""greatly fuelling inflation""
  in the economy, the letter said.
      The letter said the Food Department would be able to
  release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the
  immediate cereal requirements ""provided such stocks are replaced
  subsequently.""
      The Meteorological Department said the country was
  experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month
  dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when
  the monsoon rains fell in late May.
      The letter said some areas had been experiencing the
  drought since August, and in the rice growing district of
  Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June
  1986.

  The collapse of International Coffee

      The Reagan administration proposed in trade legislation

  bill also was introduced by Rep. Frank Guarini (D-N.J.).

  The United States does not expect

  Chances that the International Coffee
  Organization, ICO, executive board meeting this week will agree
  to resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote, ICO
  delegates and trade sources said.
      ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries are
  ready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side that
  reopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said.
      ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight days
  when producers and consumers failed to reach agreement.
       ""Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions,
  it's difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage,""
  Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must be
  negotiated sometime, he said.
       The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas
  but that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lower
  its export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegates
  said.
       At this week's March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICO
  board is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, the
  reintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and some
  administrative matters, according to a draft agenda.
      The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio
  Dauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and
  chief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the
  meeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a
  non-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned.
      ""I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among
  producers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal
  by September (the next scheduled council meeting),"" Bronwyn
  Curtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said.
      Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a
  date will be set for an earlier council meeting.
      If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect the
  coffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the
  remainder of its life, to September 30, 1989.
      When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largest
  coffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one another
  for sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise.
      Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares,
  under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports,
  but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares
  to be redistributed using ""objective criteria,"" which would have
  threatened Brazil's share.
      At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers,
  Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their
  objections as members of the group of eight ICO ""dissident""
  producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline in
  prices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez
  Cuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to brief
  producers on the Managua meeting.
      However, other producers said they were not aware of this
  move toward producer solidarity.

  The U.S. Congress is making Japan,
  with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of the
  U.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around
  America's record trade deficit.
      ""Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: the
  challenge to our high technology industries, the threat of
  government nutured competition, and the multitude of barriers
  to our exports,"" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said.
      ""If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade
  problems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries,""
  the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee
  hearing on the trade bill.
      Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, have
  made trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-ranging
  bill is being readied for probable House approval next month.
      Japan's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs
  in 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14
  billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January.
      Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade
  deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to
  the dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason to
  press Japan to buy more U.S. goods.
      They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration
  in U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology.
      In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S.
  semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he
  intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese
  electronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide by
  a 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement.
      Congress also has been been angered by the administration's
  lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues
  including beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications
  goods, and financial services.
      The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in
  four committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and
  measures to force the administration take tough action against
  foreign trade barriers and unfair competition.
      Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many
  cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese
  products or make them more expensive with higher duties.
      The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House
  Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to
  force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign
  competition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win
  temporary relief from surges in imports.
      The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict
  imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not
  buy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House.
      Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirant
  from Missouri, has the support of Wright and other key
  Democrats to press for passage of the amendment.
      The measure would have the most impact on Japan, West
  Germany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, does
  not reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States would
  set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per
  cent a year for three years.
      ""I'm tired of going into companies and having managers say
  to me, 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can't
  compete in the marketplace.' That argument needs to be taken
  away from American business,"" Gephardt said.
      The administration has said it could not support a trade
  bill containing such a provision.

  There was no evidence of winterkill

  running northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S.
  Agriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a field
  report.
      The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of

  because of dry conditions.
      However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have
  promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on
  last fall's late seeding, it said.
      Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the
  situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out
  of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the
  report said.

  under these conditions, they said.

  Crude oil netback values in complex

  The Brazilian Coffee Institute,
  IBC, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system when
  it reopens export registrations, probably later this week,
  exporters said.
      They said IBC President Jorio Dauster is likely to leave
  the basic formula for the minimum registration price unchanged
  but raise the contribution quota to partially offset the
  effects of cruzado devaluation since April registrations were
  closed in mid-February.
      To fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have to
  be around 28 dlrs per bag against 7.0 when registrations closed.
      However, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contribution
  quota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets,
  and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, the
  exporters said.
      They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contribution
  quota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnet
  funds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteed
  producer price.
      Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide more
  funds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds last
  week, funds are still being released for subsequent approval.
      The sources said it is still unclear when registrations
  will be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end of
  this week.
      ""Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentions
  know. A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanently
  closed down,"" one exporter said.
      However, before announcing its export policy the IBC is
  likely to wait to see if tomorrow's meeting of the
  International Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board in
  London decides to call a full council meeting to discuss
  reintroduction of export quotas, sources said.
      There is also talk of the announcement this week of new
  measures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could be
  awaiting clarification before making any move, the exporters
  said.
      Another factor which could be delaying the opening of
  registrations is the current strike by bank workers which,
  while not affecting current shipments, could affect
  documentation and currency operations for new sales.
      This would certainly be the case if the IBC was considering
  obliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two or
  three days of registering a sale.

  U.S. refiners will have to
  reduce operations if they want to be profitable this year, said
  industry officials attending the National Petroleum Refiners
  Association meeting here.
       ""If the refining sector can discipline itself to refine
  about 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day, we have a chance to
  pull down inventories to acceptable levels by the second
  quarter, said Archie Dunham, executive vice president of
  petroluem products at Conoco Inc
      ""If not, the industry will have a tough 1987,"" he added.
       Last week's American Petroleum Institute report said that
  U.S. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity,
  with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the week
  ended March 20.
       The API said that with the higher crude oil runs, 
  distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-ago
  levels. Gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels, some 17.2
  mln barrels above year-ago levels. Distillate stocks, at 108.7
  mln barrels, are 10.9 mln barrels above last year's level, the
  API said.
       Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp
  &lt;CNP> told Reuters that unless refining and marketing return to
  profitability, oil companies will have to rely on downstream
  operations to produce an acceptable level of earnings.
       ""The jump in refining capacity is a concern if it
  continues,"" said Kenneth Buckler, executive vice president of
  refining and marketing at &lt;Total Petroleum Co>, a U.S.
  subsidiary of Cie Francaise Des Petroles of France.
       Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity given
  the current level of demand but the operating level should
  increase as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter,
  Buckler said.
       Dunham said the potential operable capacity of U.S.

  A high level U.S. trade official
  said it would be foolish for Japan to strike back against the
  United States for its sanctions on Japanese semiconductor
  electronics products.
      Asked by reporters if Japan was expected to retaliate
  against U.S. exports, Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce Bruce
  Smart replied, ""That would be the height of foolishness.""
      In addition, he doubted Japan could show enough progress in
  meeting the conditions of the agreement to avoid the actual
  imposition of the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on April 17.
      Japan's 58.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United
  States last year has come under fire in Congress concerned
  about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the
  record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986.
      President Reagan's sanctions decision won praise today from
  the two Democratic leaders of Congress.
      ""I think it's about time,"" Senate Democratic Leader Robert
  Byrd of West Virginia told reporters. House Speaker Jim Wright
  of Texas told reporters before the opening of the House
  session, ""It just shows we were right all along when we said

      Smart testified before a Senate Labor Committee hearing
  that last Friday's U.S. trade action would help U.S.
  negotiations on access to Japan for U.S. auto parts.
      Since last August Smart has been leading talks to open up
  Japan to purchases of more U.S.-made automotive parts. Last
  year, Japan racked up a 3.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the
  United States in these products.
      Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987.

      The United States has tried to convince Japanese car
  companies of the quality of American-made parts and to draw
  them away from their traditional Japanese suppliers.
      ""All we ask is a chance. We have a job to do persuading them
  we can do better than our reputation seems to be,"" he said.
      Measured per car, each American-made car contained about

  The Federal Reserve's move to easier
  monetary policy, begun with four quick half-point discount rate
  cuts in 1986, will likely end with a final rate drop in the
  second quarter, analysts said.
      A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to
  edge lower, with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending rate
  from 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy.
      ""The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further without
  a full-blown recession,"" said Raymond Stone, chief financial
  economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
      Stone said economic data available by late June may be just
  weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut. But he said
  it may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual half
  point, to avoid hurting the dollar further.
      All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open Market
  Committee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged.
      The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly
  quarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasury
  bond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at which
  banks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the prime
  lending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct.
      Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly to
  the April-June quarter, follow:
      - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further
  against other major currencies because of a large U.S. budget
  deficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted after
  the dollar's steep drop in the last two business days, the
  economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that
  the dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect.
      - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue
  trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well
  test the lower end of that range.
      - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and
  probably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strong
  foreign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. The
  outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year
  since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up.
      - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator
  will rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. The
  sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as will
  a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year.
      - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pct
  annual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand at
  respective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 first
  and second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pct
  annual
  rate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter.
      Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International sees
  both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among
  those surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pct
  rate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate this
  quarter and 3.5 pct next quarter.
      ""The economy will bounce back more strongly than many
  expect,"" Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup in
  inventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quarter
  economic growth, with consumer spending helping later.
      ""We're running out of special factors to keep the economy
  afloat,"" said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. His
  interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest.
      Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation
  helped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively.
  He expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that second
  quarter growth could be zero or negative.
      Braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer
  from a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow 
  government spending and less construction. Only a marginally
  narrower trade deficit will add to growth.
      He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds,
  with Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct,
  respectively. Nikko's Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct for
  bonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate.
      Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly
  after the dollar's fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in past
  days and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan.
      David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Inc
  raised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20
  pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct.
      Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, lifted
  his forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a point
  to eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds. Both Nicho and
  Resler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct.
      The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japanese
  investors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fear
  about further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S.
  trade sanctions. Yields may have to rise to lure other buyers.

  Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman
  De Croo said he believed there would be a compromise within the

  and oil, averting a pledged tough trade response by the United
  States.
      De Croo, in Washington for talks with Administration

  there is a battle within the community on the tax on fats and
  oils used in the 12 EC countries.
      But he added, ""I do not think it will be a big issue because

      U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday
  that if the community went ahead with the tax, the United
  States would respond ""vigorously"" to protect its trade rights and
  access to community markets.
      De Croo also said he thought the community would postpone

  cover all meats brought into EC nations if some progress was

  Development of costly shale oil,
  liquified coal and other kinds of synthetic fuels, halted in
  recent years because of cheap and abundant petroleum supplies,
  will become economic again when world oil prices top 30 dlrs a
  barrel, an Exxon Co USA executive said.
      Joe McMillan, a senior vice president, told Reuters after
  addressing a Houston meeting of the American Institute of
  Chemical Engineers, ""By early in the next century, synthetics
  should play a significant role in this country's energy
  supply.""
      McMillan also told reporters at a news conference that he
  believed synthetic fuels would become economic to develop when
  world oil prices reached a 30 to 40 dlr a barrel price range.
      ""You're talking about a 50 pct increase in crude oil
  prices, but I think that time is coming and we've got to be
  prepared,"" McMillan said.
      He predicted U.S. oil demand would rise by about one pct
  annually in the next few years while the nation fails to
  replace its oil reserves through exploration. By the turn of
  the century, world oil prices will be significantly higher
  because of declining supplies, McMillan said.
      Ashland Oil, Inc. chairman John Hall, who also spoke at the
  meeting, advocated some form of federal tax incentives to help
  spur development of synthetic fuels.
      The United States, Hall said, has nearly 500 billion tons
  of demonstrated coal reserves, an amount more than triple that
  of all the world's known oil reserves.
      ""We must encourage research now in order to make synfuels
  competitive later,"" Hall said. The average lead time for
  development of a shale oil or liquified coal project is between
  five and ten years.
      Until last year, the federal government had subsidized
  synfuels development through the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., a
  research program created during the Carter Administration with
  the goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrels
  of oil.
      The corporation was shut down last April when Congress

  The U.S. should reassess
  its Mideast policy in light of its rising dependence on
  imported oil, according to Charles Ebinger of the Center for
  Strategic and International Studies.
       ""The prospect of rising dependence on oil imports from the
  Gulf, and the recent revelations of the Tower Commission
  report, mandate more than ever before the need for a
  fundamental reassessment of U.S. interests in the Middle East,""
  Ebinger said.
       He remarks were made in an address to the National
  Petroleum Refiners Association meeting.
       ""Although in the short run it is difficult to see a direct
  link between Arab anger and threats to oil supplies, in the
  current environment it will be increasingly difficult for
  moderate Arab leaders to be seen as friendly to U.S.
  interests,"" Ebinger said.
       Oil traders said threats to oil supplies has kept crude
  oil prices strong recently although some believe prices will be
  weaker if demand falls in the spring.
      But William Randol, analyst at First Boston Corp, said
  crude oil prices will hold  near current levels this spring.
      There will be no spring downturn, said Randol, speaking at
  the annual refiner meeting. He said there is a 40 pct chance
  that crude oil prices could move higher in the second half of
  the year, following an OPEC meeting scheduled for late June.
      He said he expects OPEC will extend its current agreement
  to restrict production.
      OPEC will renew its production pricing agreement in June
  because the value of the oil exports of the OPEC producers  has
  declined along with the U.S. dollar, Randol said.
      OPEC oil exports are priced in U.S. dollars, and the dollar
  has fallen about 30 pct in the last 18 months.
      Randol said U.S. crude oil imports will increase 3.5 to

  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may have
  been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen's renewed rapid
  rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States,
  political analysts said.
      Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reform
  plan, may now be forced to resign before the June economic
  summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later
  next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal
  Democratic Party (LDP), they said.
      ""The close relationship between Nakasone and President
  Reagan was an important element of Nakasone's power base,""
  Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida
  told Reuters. ""So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damages
  Nakasone.""
      Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone was
  encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but
  also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax.
      ""Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from
  Nakasone,"" Uchida said. ""His position within the LDP itself is
  not so strongly established today.""
      Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general public
  than with many LDP members, is now seeing his public support
  eroded, the analysts said.
      The yen's rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat on
  Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in
  retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a microchip trade
  pact are now giving Nakasone's critics fresh ammunition, the
  analysts said.
      ""Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and
  Nakasone hasn't worked effectively,"" Rei Shiratori, director of
  the Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said.
      This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone's
  credibility, Shiratori told Reuters.
      The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen's
  rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses
  in the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said.
      ""If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have to
  resign early,"" Shiratori said.
      But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempers
  before or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29,
  some analysts said.
      However, ""unless the Japanese political system can move more
  quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to
  Washington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a very
  hostile audience,"" said Merrill Lynch Securities economist
  William Sterling.
      ""If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put the
  final nail in his coffin,"" he said.
      Reagan's own weakened domestic position, and growing
  Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argue
  against a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analysts
  said.
      But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupled
  with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to
  Nakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over the
  differences and aid Nakasone, they said.
      ""One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is
  not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave,"" Sterling said.

  India cut the export duty on coffee

      The International Coffee Organisation, which represents

  Rising imports of Japanese-made cars and
  electronic goods may upset West European officials, but they
  generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest
  trade row between the United States and Japan.
      Japan's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe,
  as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair trade
  practices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold.
      The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficit
  with Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanese
  trade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said.
      But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of acting
  with the U.S. To do something about Japan's huge trade surplus.
      ""The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the
  U.S.,"" said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade Policy
  Research Centre in London. ""Basically, their policies are pretty
  much the same.""
      But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Or
  that the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of
  the U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically,
  Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said.
      ""In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here,"" he
  added. ""In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic of
  free competition, while in Europe, the general approach is that
  liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich.""
      Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington's
  tendency to impose so-called ""countervailing duties"" - an import
  tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair.
      In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends to
  be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said.
      In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan has
  threatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronic
  goods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan has
  failed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade.
      But the European Community has challenged the agreement as
  a violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
  practices that discriminates against its microchip producers.
      ""It follows that they're not likely to rally to the side of
  the United States in defence of the agreement,"" said Wolf.
      Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a tough
  line on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the rest
  of Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC take
  the lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row.
      A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels told
  Reuters there has been no change in the Community's position
  since a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent a
  strong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances.
      In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreign
  ministers deplored Japan's continued trade imbalance and
  appealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets.
      EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said after
  the talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC.
      Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw no
  signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad-ranging
  sanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking a
  trade war, they said.
      Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas in
  European trade with Japan, including wines and spirits,
  cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking to
  try to improve the situation, the diplomats said.
      In Britain, where the government is angered over the
  difficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless has
  faced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials said
  last week that retaliatory action is being considered.
      But government officials said last night, ""We are not
  talking about days or weeks. This is going to take time.""
      They said the government would consider its options at a
  cabinet meeting on Thursday, but added that no final decisions
  were expected. The main thing the British would threaten the
  Japan with is denial of access to London's booming financial
  markets, government officials said.

  said.
      They said Chung would leave for Washington on Monday to
  attend the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Interim
  Committee meeting and for talks with U.S. Officials on ways of
  reducing Seoul's trade surplus with Washington.
      The dates for the Baker-Chung meeting have yet to be set.
      The IMF committee meeting, scheduled for April 9, is
  expected to review the resolution reached by the six top

  allow their currencies to rise.
      The official said Chung is expected to outline Seoul's
  efforts to increase imports of U.S. Goods and to stress the
  need for South Korea to maintain a trade surplus in the next
  few years in order to cut foreign debts totalling some 44.5
  billion dlrs.
      South Korea has ruled out a major revaluation of the won,
  but is allowing its currency to appreciate slowly.
      Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae told the U.S. Chamber of

  CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> has made a bold move in
  selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and
  ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share
  analysts said.
      ""It sounds like a good deal,"" Stuart McKibbin of &lt;A.C. Goode
  and Co> told Reuters.
      CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas
  interests held in the &lt;Delhi Australia Fund> and would instead
  sell it to Exxon Corp &lt;XON> unit &lt;Esso Exploration and
  Production Australia Inc> for 985 mln dlrs.
      In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largest
  sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it
  does not already hold in &lt;Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd>.
      ""This will be a big shock to the market, which was under the
  impression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi,""
  McKibbin said.
      A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and
  300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, CSR had given
  itself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on
  an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing
  divisions of sugar and building products, analysts said.
      CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the right
  to share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from an
  oil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years.
      Delhi is one of Australia's largest onshore oil producers
  yielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin.
  Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrs
  for every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs.
      Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker &lt;Bain and Co Ltd>
  said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industry
  was a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of
  Australian-owned assets to a foreign company.
      ""The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold
  back to the Americans,"" Goldston-Morris said.
      The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far the
  largest player in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry
  and would give it access to some of the best sugar properties
  and mills in the country, analysts said.
      They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend
  acceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from the
  bottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices.
      Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next
  season from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said.
      Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaging
  investment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the company's
  overall performance, analysts said.
      CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on
  what had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirely
  from U.S. Dollar debt, they said.
      ""It was a bad investment for them. They financed it entirely
  with debt, the currency collapsed on them and then the oil
  price collapsed on them,"" Owen Evans of Sydney broker &lt;Meares
  and Philips Ltd> said.
      Esso not only picked up Delhi's oil and gas output but also
  gained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses
  accumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions.
      Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stake
  in Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50
  Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd
  &lt;BRKN.S>.
      ""Esso has been very keen to diversify from the Gippsland
  Basin. They haven't found too much oil in Bass Strait lately
  and Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production,""
  Goldston-Morris said.

  Consuming countries, chastened by the
  collapse of International Tin Council (ITC) price support
  operations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before that
  commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are
  serving, a Reuter survey showed.
      They want price ranges to be more responsive to market
  trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the
  accords' support operations - and intervention rules that avoid
  the risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts.
  Consumers and producers, mindful of ITC buffer stock losses,
  have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations.
      Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a
  generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and
  prefer to assess each commodity case by case, the survey
  showed.
      The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) last week set
  precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager (BSM) could do
  under the new agreement. It imposed daily and weekly purchase
  limits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets
  and stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of
  total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. This
  will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, the
  world's fourth largest producer, undermining the market.
      The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer
  Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.
      A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) was
  adopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exporting
  countries agreed several changes to make the reference price
  more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions
  under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance
  operations. Direct cash contributions from members will fund
  buffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular feature
  of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running
  into hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue.
      Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiations
  in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that
  agreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said.
      Consumers and a small group of producers argued that
  ""objective criteria"" should be used to define export quota
  shares, which would have meant a reduction in the share of
  Brazil, the world's leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintain
  its previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and,
  although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today,
  delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term
  negotiations on export quota distribution as remote.
      International agreements exist for sugar and wheat. These
  do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for
  discussions on possible future economic agreements, collect
  statistics and draw up market analyses. Analysts said
  differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any
  progress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheer
  competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut
  militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat.
      An alternative focus for commodity discussions are
  international study groups, made up of governments with advice
  from industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber.
      The U.N. Common fund for commodities, with a planned
  directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed to
  become operational because neither the U.S. Nor the Soviet
  Union has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said the
  U.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives,
  citing the lack of widespread support.
      U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in
  Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity
  pact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing to
  study individual cases for economically sound, market-oriented
  commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.
      ""We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the
  price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,""
  official Administration policy states. The U.S. Currently
  belongs to only two international commodity agreements that
  have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement
  (ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat
  pacts.
      The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement
  because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and
  not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries,
  the State Department said. U.S. Officials singled out the INRA
  as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working.
      U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other members
  of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment
  mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect
  market trends and also to continue the accord as a market
  oriented agreement, U.S. Officials said.
      Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have
  consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on
  the merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister
  Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country, the
  world's top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides its
  participation in international commodity pacts case by case.
      Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing
  Countries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPC
  launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnes
  for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from
  70,000.
      Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and
  delegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told
  Reuters in London, ""Agreements with economic clauses to
  stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were
  close to market reality, if there was full participation by
  producers and consumers, and if participants were prepared to
  take their obligations in the framework of the agreement
  seriously.""
      But Baron added, ""No real sanctions are available for a
  country that doesn't stick to its obligations...The German
  approach is sceptical. We don't think agreements are the best
  instrument to help developing countries. They were never meant
  to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how
  developing countries often interpret them.""
      Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of
  commodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with Third
  World producing countries. But recently demands for more
  stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the
  need for ""intellectual honesty"" and ""objective criteria"" have
  grown.
      British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be
  a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.
      It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct
  market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree
  of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended
  borrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K.
  Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to
  reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather
  than dictate what prices should be.
      A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price
  realism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.
      A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable
  to commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer of
  sugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real
  market situation, particularly regarding stocks.
      Indonesia's Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told
  Reuters in Jakarta: ""These agreements can work as long as the
  problems are cyclical..But it's another matter when there are
  structural problems..But we are still committed to commodity
  agreements as an act of faith."" Nicaraguan External Trade
  Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers
  cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity
  agreements.
      ""The political will is not there on the part of some
  consumers to make agreements work,"" Martinez Cuenca said.
      The head of the economics department in the Brazilian
  Foreign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters an
  agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market
  reality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system
  of quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pact
  and actual market prices, it can work. UNCTAD spokesman Graham
  Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings
  enhance developing countries' ability to service debt and mean
  greater demand for industrialised nations' capital goods.

  from next month in line with government attempts to ward off
  U.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said.
      The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off the
  sanctions, despite obstacles to full implementation of the
  plans, analysts said.
      The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth of
  products and are in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to
  honour a semiconductor trade pact.
      In announcing the sanctions last Friday, President Reagan
  said Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory
  pricing and open Japan's market to foreign products.
      But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter said
  yesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to drop
  the tariffs if Japan shows a ""clear indication"" that it will open
  its markets to U.S. Goods.
      The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has
  urged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in the
  second quarter, following a call to reduce production by more
  than 20 pct the previous quarter.
      MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports.
      Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington to
  cancel the tariffs ahead of next month's meeting between Prime
  Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan.
      ""The U.S. Wants to be satisfied. It has rattled its sword
  and shown that it can and will do business,"" said analyst Nick
  Edwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo.
      But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers can
  cut output, boosting imports -- the key to U.S. Withdrawal of
  the sanctions -- is more difficult.
      ""The U.S. Does not have the low-end consumer IC's
  (integrated circuits) that the Japanese need for consumer
  products. They're well supplied here,"" said Richard May, senior
  analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo.
      The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high-end IC's,
  but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high-end
  production skills, the analysts said.
      ""The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses on
  semiconductors in return for free access to other areas,"" said
  Edwards.
      A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT.T>, said the firm's
  reduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory
  (256K DRAM) was unrelated to MITI's efforts to ward off the
  trade sanctions. Decreased production was a natural result of
  the company increasing output of one-mln bit DRAM's, he said.
      Company officials unveiled the following plans -
      - NEC Corp &lt;NESI.T>, Japan's largest chipmaker, plans to
  slash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct to
  six mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln last
  quarter.
       In the year beginning April 1, NEC will boost chip
  imports, which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chip
  consumption the year before.
      - Hitachi Ltd's &lt;HIT.T> April output of 256K DRAM's will
  fall by 25.93 pct to four mln compared to 5.4 mln in March. The
  company is trying to boost imports but has not set a specific
  target. Imports are currently very low.
      - Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> will reduce April 256K DRAM
  production by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and is
  considering ways to boost imports, a company official said.
      Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc (MOT.N) to sell
  the U.S. Firm's chips in Japan. The firms are planning a
  joint-venture production of memory chips in Sendai, northern
  Japan.
      - Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MIET.T) will trim second
  quarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mln
  chips compared to the first quarter. Plans call for increased
  imports but an official said ""boosting imports will be difficult
  as it depends on sales demand.""
      - Fujitsu Ltd (ITSU.T) will cut production in accord with
  MITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels.
      - Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd (OKIE.T) will reduce April
  production by 10 pct from March's 3.2 mln. Oki is studying ways
  to increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginning
  April 1 from the previous year's total of more than five
  billion yen, a company official said.

  CSR Ltd has made a bold move in selling

      CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas

  sell them to Exxon Corp unit Esso Exploration and Production
  Australia Inc for 985 mln dlrs.
      In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largest

  does not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd.
      A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and

  itself the cash to all but eliminate its debt and embark on an
  ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions

      The Pioneer Sugar investment would give CSR by far the

  The U.S. Is willing to drop tariffs on
  Japanese electronic imports if Japan shows it will abide by an
  agreemement opening its markets to American goods, U.S. Trade
  Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a TV interview.
      ""But there has to be a clear indication that they are
  willing to act,"" he said.
      Yeutter said difficulties in the Japanese economy caused by
  the U.S. Tariffs and the yen's rise against the dollar are
  problems ""they have brought on themselves.""
      The dollar fell to 40-year lows against the yen today.
      ""Certainly the movement of the yen is causing some economic
  turmoil in Japan,"" he said. ""My only response is that we have
  gone through about five years with the dollar going in just the
  opposite direction. Although I can sympathise, it's occurred
  for only a few weeks or months in Japan.""
      The tarriffs, announced on Friday by President Reagan, will
  affect about 300 million dlrs worth of products, only a tiny
  fraction of Japan's total exports to the U.S.
      Even so, Reagan's decision ""doesn't give us any joy. We

  Yeutter said.
      Yeutter said the meetings scheduled next month in
  Washington between Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone

      Japan has failed to implement two parts of a three-part
  semiconductor agreement, Yeutter said.
      Japan has stopped dumping chips in the U.S. But it has
  failed to open its domestic markets to U.S.-made chips and has
  failed to end predatory pricing in Third World countries,
  undercutting U.S. Products, he said.

  The U.S. index of leading indicators
  rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7 pct in February after a revised
  0.5 pct January fall, the Commerce Department said.
      The department previously said the index fell 1.0 pct in
  January.
      The February increase left the index at 187.1 over its 1967
  base of 100, and was led by a rise in stock prices.
      A total of four of nine indicators available for February
  contributed to the increase in the index.
      Besides stock prices, they were manufacturers' new orders
  for consumer goods and materials, average work week and
  building permits.
      Five of nine indicators were negative. They were change in
  sensitive materials prices, money supply, vendor performance,
  average weekly initial claims for state unemployment insurance,
  and contracts and orders for plant and equipment.
      The main factor in the January revision was contracts and
  orders for plant and equipment, the department said.
      December also was revised to a 2.4 pct rise from an earlier
  2.3 pct rise due to a change in outstanding credit.
      The index of coincident indicators, which measures the
  current economy, rose 0.9 pct in February after a decline of
  1.3 pct in January and a rise of 0.9 pct in December.
      The index of lagging indicators, which measures past
  economic activity, decreased 0.3 pct in February after
  increasing 1.7 pct in January and falling by 0.5 pct in
  December.
      The department said it has suspended net business formation

  Executive board members of the
  International Coffee Organization, ICO, passed over the issue
  of export quota negotiations at its regular meeting here,
  delegates said.
      No move was made to reopen dialogue on export quotas and no
  further discussion on the issue is likely during the three-day
  talks, they said.
      Producer and consumer members of the ICO council failed to
  agree export quota shares in early March.
      Neither Brazil, the largest producer, nor the U.S., the
  largest consumer, are ready to be flexible, delegates said.
      ""The situation is unchanged,"" consumer spokesman Abraham Van
  Overbeeke told reporters. ""As long as Brazil sticks to its
  position there will not be quotas -- there is no point in
  meeting.""
      At the last council meeting, Brazil wanted to maintain its
  previous quota share of around 30 pct of the market. Consumers
  and a splinter group of eight producers favoured redistribution
  of export shares using ""objective criteria,"" which would likely
  have reduced Brazil's share.
      Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said that, if quota
  negotiations were to resume, the 1.0 mln bag shortfall Brazil
  was willing to give up in early March if the producer proposal
  was accepted would no longer be on the table.
      ""As we said from the start...No agreement, no one million
  bags,"" he told Reuters.
      Shortfalls of 200,000 bags offered by OAMCAF, the African
  and Malagasy Coffee Organization, and 20,000 bags offered by
  Angola, are also no longer valid, delegates said.
      The closest the board came to discussing quotas was a
  briefing by the Guatemalan ICO delegate Rene Montes on a recent
  Latin American producers meeting in Managua, delegates said.
      There, the producers expressed their political will to
  negotiate basic quotas, particularly in the face of the
  damaging drop in coffee prices after the council failed to
  agree quotas, Montes said.
      The ICO board also reviewed export statistics and stock
  verification. They expected talks on stock verification to take
  up the remainder of today's session, delegates said.

  The Institute for Economic Research
  (WIFO) said it has cut its forecast for Austria's 1987 gross
  domestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pct
  forecast made last December.
      WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he saw
  the one pct figure, which compares with 1.8 pct last year, as
  the upper limit of growth. The institute had made the revision
  due to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added.
      A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oil
  producing states, combined with the effects of the dollar's
  fall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year.
      Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth this
  year. After last year's 2.8 pct rise in real incomes, private
  consumption was likely to rise 2.25 pct in 1987 after 1.9 pct
  in 1986, despite a present trend towards higher savings.
      Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 5.2
  pct last year due to the slack economic activity.
      Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficit
  of about four billion schillings compared with a 2.6 billion
  surplus recorded last year. The National Bank, Austria's
  central bank, last month forecast the current account would be
  roughly in balance this year.
      However, Kramer said the lower economic growth should have
  no notable effect on the government's attempts to cut the
  budget deficit. This year's aim of reducing the deficit to 4.9
  pct of GDP from 5.1 pct in 1986 could still be achieved, he
  said.

  Australia faces a major medium term
  adjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance,
  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said
  in its latest annual review of the Australian economy.
      It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-3/4
  pct of gross domestic product, high and rapidly rising external
  debt equal to 30 pct of GDP, growing servicing costs and
  inflation above nine pct, far higher than that of other OECD
  countries.
      A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basis
  for sustained non-inflationary growth and external
  competitiveness had improved, but economic performance overall
  had sharply deteriorated since June 1985.
      A major shift of real resources to the external sector --
  about 4-1/2 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for the
  economy to expand in line with potential, for employment to
  grow, and for the debt/GDP ratio to stabilize, it said.
      Success depended on the setting of right policies including
  tighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the public sector
  borrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour.
      Looking ahead over the next 18 months, the OECD expected
  economic performance to improve, partly as a result of tighter
  fiscal and monetary policy, and a substantial improvement in
  trade volumes.
      It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored,
  the current external deficit could fall to some 4-1/2 pct of
  GDP by the first half of next year, while inflation was
  projected to decelerate to around five to 5-1/2 pct by
  mid-1988.
      Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintain
  the competitive edge created by the Australian dollar's
  depreciation, and to maintain if not boost profit shares in
  order to encourage business investment.
      The report urged Australia to broaden its export base by
  developing viable and competitive service and manufacturing
  industries, and not count on a recovery of commodity markets to
  correct its external imbalances.
      It added Australia should reduce protection levels in
  manufacturing, even though faster trade liberalisation would no
  doubt hurt the most protected sectors of industry.

  Representatives of U.S. sugar grower
  organizations said they expect some increase the area planted
  to sugarbeets this year and said the prospects for the 1987
  cane sugar crop also are good.
      Dave Carter, president of the U.S. beet sugar association,
  said plantings may be up in two major beet growing states,
  California and Michigan, while sowings could be down slightly
  in the largest producing state of Minnesota.
      Overall, Carter predicted beet plantings would rise in the
  midwest, and this coupled with increases in California would
  increase U.S. sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1.232 mln
  acres sown last year.
      USDA later today releases its first estimate of 1987 U.S.
  sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report.
      The main reason for the expected increase in beet sowings
  is that returns from competing crops such as soybeans and
  grains are ""just awful,"" said Carter.
      In the midwest, bankers are strongly encouraging farmers to
  plant sugarbeets because the U.S. sugar program offers a loan
  rate of 18 cents per pound and because payments to farmers from
  beet processors are spread evenly over the growing season, said
  Luther Markwart, executive vice president of the American
  sugarbeet growers association.
      ""The banks are putting a lot of pressure on these guys,""
  Markwart said.
      In some areas there are waiting lists of farmers seeking a
  contract with processors to plant beets, Markwart said.
      USDA's report today will not include any harvested area
  estimates for sugarcane, but representatives of Florida, Hawaii
  and Louisiana growers said crop prospects are good.
      Horis Godfrey, a consultant representing Florida and Texas
  cane growers, said Florida cane is off to a good start  because
  for the first time in several years there was no winter freeze.
  Although area to be harvesteed is about the same as last year,
  cane production may be up in Florida this year, he said.
      In Hawaii, area harvested may decline slightly this year,
  but likely will be offset again in 1987 by increased yields,
  said Eiler Ravnholt, vice president of the Hawaiian Sugar
  Planters Association.
      The acreage planted to sugarbeets will receive more than
  the usual amount of attention this year because of mounting
  concern that continued increases in domestic sugar production
  threaten the U.S. sugar program, industry sources said.
      The increases in beet plantings have especially caused
  concern among cane growers who have not expanded plantings,
  particularly in Hawaii, industry officials said.
      ""We haven't had a good weather year throughout the beet and
  cane areas in more than five years,"" said Godfrey, adding that
  the U.S. may be due for a good weather year.
      Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., chairman of the House
  agriculture subcommittee responsible for the sugar program, has
  threatened to offer legislation next year to curb domestic
  sweetener output if growers fail to restrain output in 1987.

  The Kansas City Board of Trade,
  KCBT, has asked federal futures regulators to modify a proposal
  to raise the Chicago Board of Trade's, CBT, speculative
  position limits on wheat futures contracts, saying the plan
  would put the the Kansas exchange ""at a serious competitive
  disadvantage.""
      The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, last month
  proposed raising CBT wheat speculative limits to 1,200
  contracts all months net from 600 contracts, and to 900
  contracts for any single month from 600 contracts.
      At the same time, CFTC proposed leaving KCBT's wheat
  speculative position limits unchanged.
      ""Higher limits for CBT wheat than for KCBT wheat would
  significantly impair the KCBT's ability to compete with the CBT
  for speculative interest,"" Michael Braude, president of the
  Kansas exchange, said in a letter to CFTC.
      A CFTC spokesman said the commission took into account open
  interest affected by existing speculative limits in proposing
  to raise CBT's limits.
      KCBT said the CFTC proposal would reduce hedging
  efficiency, constrain growth of intermarket spreading and of
  the exchange's wheat options contract and impair its ability to
  attract large speculators.
      The Kansas City exchange asked the commission to amend its
  proposal to change the limits for KCBT wheat to the exact same
  bushel amount as specified for CBT wheat.
      CFTC will consider public comments on the proposal until
  June 3.

  Exxon Corp said in its annual report
  that it raised production in 1986 although it did not replace
  all oil and gas produced.
      The company said that it added about four pct to production
  bringing it to 1.8 mln bpd, the highest level since 1979, based
  largely on increased production of oil overseas but additions
  to its reserves from new discoveries and reserve acquisitions
  did not replace all of the oil and gas produced.
      The company said that the average price for oil and gas
  declined 41 pct in 1986 from the previous year sparking a 38
  pct decline in its earnings from exploration and production.
      Exxon's earnings from exploration and production in 1986
  fell to 3.1 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.
      Exxon said that its principal gains in production came from
  the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the North Sea, Malaysia and from
  oil sands in Canada.
      Exxon also said that it acquired 11.2 mln acres for
  expoloration spread over 10 countries including the U.S, Europe
  and the Far East.
      But capital expenditures for exploration and production
  were cut to 4.6 billion dlrs from 7.6 billion the previous year
  and further reductions were expected in 1987.
      Exxon said that its net share of crude oil and natural gas
  liquids produced from offshore fields in the North Sea reached
  a new high of 422,000 bpd.
      The light, sweet crudes produced from these North Sea
  fields also gave the company trading gains as Exxon was able to
  sell much of this crude and replace it with cheaper, lower
  quality crude oil for its refineries which have been upgraded
  over the past several years.
      The trading gains and lower acquisition costs gave Exxon
  more of a spread in its refinery operations and added to
  earnings gains from refining and marketing.
      Exxon said earnings from refining and marketing operations
  rose to nearly two billion dlrs in 1986, up from 872 mln dlrs
  in 1985.
      The company said petroleum sales slipped slightly to 4.043
  mln barrels per day from 4.082 mln bpd in 1985 while crude runs
  rose to 3.0 mln bpd from 2.9 mln bpd the previous year.
      Exxon's refinery operations benefited from a three year 500
  mln dlr upgrading program to its Baytown, Texas refinery
  completed last October and an 850 mln dlr upgrading project in
  Rotterdam both of which emphasize utilizing lower grade crudes
  to extract higher proportions of light products.

  China's application to join the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is seen as a test case by
  the Soviet Union, which will probably demand to follow China, a
  top European Community official said.
      Willy de Clercq, External Relations Commissioner of the
  European Communities, told a news conference that China's
  application would involve long and difficult negotiations.
      China formally applied to join GATT in July 1986 and in
  February presented a memorandum backing its application, which
  De Clercq said was now being studied. Questions would then be
  presented to China.
      ""After China, other important state-trading countries
  including the Soviet Union, will probably demand accession.
  China's application could be considered a test case,"" he said.
      He said the EC strongly backed China's application, but
  others among GATT's 92 contracting parties took a tougher line.
      Among the numerous problems of a huge centrally-run economy
  entering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity and
  the expectation that China will practice an open-trade policy
  without trade discrimination, de Clercq added.
      De Clercq noted the different dimensions of the Chinese
  economy and those of Hungary and Yugoslavia, the two current
  Socialist GATT members.
      On China's import potential, he said a foreign exchange
  shortage would force China to import less this year and next
  than in the past, with an emphasis on technological equipment
  and capital.
      During his visit, De Clercq has met top Chinese leaders and
  today signed an agreement to open a European Community
  Commission office in Peking.

  A plan by European producers to sell
  854,000 tonnes of sugar to European Community intervention
  stocks still stands, Andrea Minguzzi, an official at French

      Last week Beghin-Say president Jean-Marc Vernes said a
  possible settlement of a row with the EC would lead producers
  to withdraw their offer, which was made as a protest against EC
  export licensing policies.
      The EC policy is to offer export rebates, which fail to
  give producers an equivalent price to that which they would get
  by offering sugar into intervention stocks, Vernes said.
      But Minguzzi said the offer was a commercial affair and
  that producers had no intention of withdrawing the sugar offer
  already lodged with intervention boards of different European
  countries. He said final quality approval for all the sugar
  offered could come later this week. Some 95 pct had already
  cleared quality specifications.
      The EC can only reject an offer to sell into intervention

  Exxon Corp said that 1986's 15 pct
  increase in earnings per share to 7.42 dlrs a share were
  partially based on its streamlined operations which compensated
  for the weakness in its exploration earnings and the lowest
  crude oil prices in a decade.
      Exxon said economies introduced in its operations from
  reductions in personnel and other savings, such as reductions
  in exploration expenses, were reflected in an 880 mln dlr
  reduction in consolidated operating costs from 1985.
      The company said its more efficient operations would be
  necessary to offset more adverse oil market conditions ahead.
      The company also said that its share repurchase plan
  contributed to the per share gains over 1985.
      In a breakdown of costs, Exxon said that operating expenses
  slipped to 9.2 billion dlrs in 1986 from 9.7 billion dlrs the
  previous year and exploration expenses, including dry holes,
  slipped back to 1.2 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion dlrs over the
  same period as the number of wells drilled was lower.
      The company was also able to use lower interest rates to
  reduce its interest expenses to 614 mln dlrs in 1986 from 627
  mln dlrs the previous year.
      Exxon said that the ratio of debt to capital was cut by 1.6
  pct in 1986 from the previous year to 19 pct.
      On December 31, 1986 Exxon's total debt of 7.87 billion
  dlrs was down slightly from the previous year's 7.9 billion
  dlrs and long term debt stood at 4.3 billion dlrs, down from
  4.8 billion dlrs in 1985.
      Exxon's policy of repurchasing shares on the market for its

  Unfavorable late winter weather
  conditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslavia
  indicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop,
  the U.S. embassy's agricultural officer in Belgrade said.
      The officer, who travelled through an area from Belgrade to
  Subotica, said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crop
  had been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spell
  that followed a period of warm weather.
      He said unseasonably warm weather in late February that
  brought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early was
  followed by three weeks of unusually cold weather.
      Damaging effects were seen in the fields, most of which
  show stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leaf
  and possible root damage from repeated freezings, he said.
      The report said that since much of the early growth in
  February was from late seeding rather than from normal
  development, his view was that the damage may be more extensive
  than some local observers say.
      The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fields
  on normal maize soils. Stands in these fields were thin and
  chances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said.
      However, he said soil moisture conditions were favorable
  and many of the fields had already been top-dressed, which
  would aid recovery.

  Trade estimates of the coming
  May/September temporao harvest in Brazil's main cocoa growing
  state of Bahia are now in the 1.5 mln to 2.0 mln 60-kilo bag
  range against 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln two weeks ago.
      Traders in the state capital Salvador told Reuters the
  effects of a dry period in the first six weeks of the year had
  been harsher than thought earlier.
      Although good flowering had followed the onset of rains in
  mid-February subsequent pod setting was dissappointing.
      Last year's temporao, also hit by a dry spell, was 2.77 mln
  bags. In 1984 severe drought cut the crop to 1.79 mln bags.
      The traders said another factor leading to lower crop
  predictions is that many farmers are not caring properly for
  plantations because of low returns on their investment.
      Manpower, fertiliser and other costs have been cut back as
  farmers feel the pinch of the rise in interest rates over the
  past six months coupled with low bean prices.
      If such economies continue into the winter months both the
  temporao and the developing October/April main crop could face
  serious damage from pod rot attacks on trees which would
  normally be treated against the disease.
      Recent very wet weather has already caused some isolated
  incidences of pod rot but reports from the growing regions say
  these are not yet significant.
      The traders said they expect very low deliveries of
  temporao beans in the first three months of the harvest and the
  bulk will not appear until the last month, September.

  French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac
  opened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus on
  superpower arms control moves and trade issues.
      French officials said a major aim of Chirac's visit was to
  present France's concern that the United States might ignore
  European security interests in any accord with Moscow on
  removing medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent.
      But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will not
  agree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would give
  the Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomats
  said.
      France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missiles
  from Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge in
  other weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets,
  conventional forces and chemical weapons.
      Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French position
  saying: ""Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should
  mention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles.""
      Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a
  dispute between two leading research institutes over patent
  rights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS.
      In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the Pasteur
  Institute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, of
  Bethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties from
  the test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight
  against AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).
      ""This agreement opens a new era in Franco-American
  cooperation, allowing France and the United States to join
  their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of
  speeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure,"" Reagan
  said at the signing ceremony. 
      He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80
  per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation.
      The foundation would also raise private funds and would
  donate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in less
  developed countries. 
      Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and the
  United States during a welcoming ceremony in the White House
  East Room, with Reagan describing France as ""America's oldest
  ally in war and peace."" 
      ""I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by the
  same ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangers
  which we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, new
  diseases and drugs,"" Chirac replied.
      But the two countries are likely to have less to agree on
  over the issue of trade, where Chirac is worried about a rise
  in protectionism in the U.S. Congress. 
      A senior U.S. official yesterday dismissed a French idea to
  sell cut-price grain to poor countries in Africa as a way of
  lessening surplus stocks.
      Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea, first
  proposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume,
  during his two-day visit to Washington.
      The U.S. official described the idea as a ""grain producers'
  OPEC"" -- a reference to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
  Countries -- and said it went against the Reagan
  administration's desire to lessen government intervention in
  trade.

  Tonight's American Petroleum Institute
  weekly inventory report is expected to show moderate drawdowns
  in distillates and gasoline stocks for the week ended March 27,
  analysts and traders said.
      They said they expect gasoline stocks to fall three mln
  barrels or less and heating oil inventories to drop between 1.3
  and four mln barrels.
      Some analysts see crude stocks falling by as much as six
  mln barrels, while others think they could go up as much as 3.5
  mln barrels. Crude oil runs are expected to be unchanged from
  the previous week or slightly higher or lower.
      For the week ended March 20, the API said gasoline stocks
  fell 2.7 mln barrels. Mosts analysts expect a modest draw for
  the week ended March 27. They said stocks could fall between
  700,000 and three mln barrels. Some said there is also a chance
  gasoline stocks will be unchanged.
      API said distillate stocks dropped four mln barrels for the
  week ended March 20. Analysts and traders generally predict a
  similar or smaller depletion for last week. They said stock
  levels could drop 1.3 to four mln barrels.
      The analysts attribute product stockdraws to seasonal
  factors but they said crude direction is harder to call.
      Crude inventories rose 8.5 mln barrels in the week ended
  March 20, API said. Analysts are looking for build of between
  3.5 mln barrels to a six mln barrel draw for the week ended
  March 27.
      API reported the amount of refinery capacity utilized up
  three pct for the week ended March 20. Analysts said
  utilization could have remained unchanged, or rose or fell by
  less than one pct for the week ended March 27.
      Moderate product stockdraws would strengthen the market
  slightly, analysts said. But bullish expectations are already
  partially reflected in today's gains, they added.

"training/11498";"International_Trade";"3";"TRADE WAR FEARS MAY PROMPT STOCK MARKETS' DOWNTURN
  The threatened trade war between the
  United States and Japan is just the kind of shock that
  economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin.
      But they are not so sure if that would be a brief
  corrective dip, or whether this week's falling share prices
  mark the start of a ""bear"" market.
      ""It's the billion dollar question,"" said Richard O'Brien,
  economist at American Express International Bank in London.
      Japan's trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- has
  poured into share and bond markets around the world, and funded
  a good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third of
  any new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the
  Japanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as the
  dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it
  fall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart of
  improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or
  because the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods,
  may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget
  deficit.
     And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will
  have less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the
  gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S.
  Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O'Brien said. The
  subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls
  on the world stock markets.
      ""A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,""
  said O'Brien. ""Now, it is much less certain.""
      Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming
  economy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best in
  the industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt and
  huge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O'Brien.
      Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of Smith
  Barney Harris Upham said  ""We're still in a bull market,"" adding
  that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and ""The
  bear usually strikes slowly.""
      Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co in
  London, said the huge sums of money going through the world
  financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices.
      Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in
  non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it's very
  difficult to see where else they can put their money than in
  U.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market,
  according to David Butcher, a senior executive at Yamaichi
  Securities Co Ltd's bond operation in London.
      He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention now
  to the French franc and West German mark.
      In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions and
  the dollar's slide will mean for securities markets.

  President Reagan has reaffirmed his
  opposition to protectionism and his chief spokesman said trade
  sanctions imposed on Japan were unlikely to start a trade war.
      ""We don't want to go down that road,"" Reagan was quoted as
  telling Prime Minister Jacques Chirac after the visiting French
  official expressed concern about the rising tide of
  protectionist sentiment in the United States.
      Later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the
  new sanctions against Japan and said administration officials
  ""do not believe this will result in a trade war.""
      ""It is the first time that the United States has taken an
  action of this type and it is significant but it is nothing to
  be alarmed about,"" the presidential spokesman added.
      ""We do not want protectionism ... We do not want a trade
  war,"" he said.
      Fitzwater said the president was forced to act in the
  Japanese microchip case because Tokyo had failed to fulfill ""an
  agreement to make some corrections.""
      Noting that there are ""enormous pressures in the Congress
  and the land"" for the United States to take a tough stand, he
  said, ""This was a case where we felt we simply had to act.""
      Fitzwater said the decision to impose sanctions was ""well

      While the White House official held open the possibility
  that Washington and Tokyo will settle their trade dispute, he
  indicated a settlement probably would not come in time to head

  United States to risk such a war.

  Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct-owned by Exxon
  Corp &lt;XON>, is negotiating with it major crude oil suppliers
  concerning the effects of a trial deregulation of Alberta's
  shut-in crude oil production, scheduled to be implemented on
  June 1, a company spokesman said.
      ""From our point of view, it's a question of entering into
  negotiations or discussions to make appropriate changes to
  contracts to reflect the changes that are going to take place
  on June 1,"" spokesman John Cote told Reuters in reply to a
  query.
      Commenting on published reports that Imperial had suspended
  its oil supply contracts, Cote said: ""It's not a question of
  cancelling or suspending any of the agreements at this point.""
      On June 1, Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board
  will lift its crude oil marketing prorationing system,
  regulating shut-in light and medium crude production, on a
  trial basis to the end of 1987.
      Under the new system, producers and refiners will be
  allowed to negotiate volumes of shut-in oil to be delivered
  under purchase contracts.
      Shut-in crude is the surplus between the total amount of
  oil being produced and the amount being purchased by refiners.
      ""We have talked to a number of our major suppliers, and
  we've discussed the upcoming change with them, but nothing has
  been finalized,"" Imperial's manager of western crude supply Gary
  Strong said.
      Under Alberta's trial system, Imperial wants to match a
  reasonable supply of crude against the company's forecast
  demand for its refineries, Strong said.
      ""We have to know what they have and how that relates to what
  we need in total,"" he said.
      Strong said figures on the amount of crude production
  Imperial purchases from outside suppliers were not immediately
  available.

  The U.S. Agriculture Department said
  it has extended until April 17 the date by which Agricultural
  Stabilization and Conservation county offices must determine
  eligibility of individuals or other entities for payments under
  1987 farm programs.
      Jerome Sitter, director of ASCS's Cotton, Grain and Rice
  Price Support Division, said the decision meant farmers have
  until April 17 to file a farm operating plan indicating how
  many persons would be involved in their farming operations.
      Earlier this year USDA extended the deadline to April 1
  from March 1, Sitter said.
      ASCA Administrator Milton Hertz said in a statement that
  the extension was necessary because of heavy workloads at
  county ASCS offices.
      Hertz said ASCS county officials ""have had to make a large
  number of eligibility determinations for individuals and other
  entities, such as corporations and partnerships, in preparation
  for imposing the 50,000-dlr-per-entity cap.""
      ""These offices already had a very heavy workload due to the
  large number of applications for both the 1987 farm programs
  and the Conservation Reserve Program,"" Hertz said.

  The U.S. grain planting intentions and
  stocks reports bear optimistic news for U.S agriculture, a
  grain analyst on a Chicago Board of Trade panel said.
      The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocks
  are ""the first report we've had for a long time that shows any
  optimism for anybody,"" said John ""Bud"" Frazier, grain analyst
  and executive vice president for Balfour MacLaine, Inc.
      ""I'm really excited about it,"" Frazier said.
      The U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers intend to
  plant 67.6 mln acres of corn, down from 76.7 mln planted last
  year, and 56.8 mln acres of soybeans, down from 61.5 mln.
      The report showed March 1 stocks of 1.4 billion bushels of
  soybeans, 8.3 billion bushels of corn, and 2.3 billion bushels
  of wheat, all below trade guesses.
      Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann, senior grain analyst
  with AgriAnalysis, and Mark Meyer, a grain analyst with
  Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., on a Chicago Board of Trade
  panel to discuss the reports.
      Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendly
  for the market, and soybean prices would jump three to five
  cents a bushel ""if the bell rang right now.""
      ""We're getting our disappearance up. We have less (corn and
  soybeans) than we thought we had,"" he said, noting that hog and
  poultry production is up.
      ""We're seeing low prices generate some interest in demand,""
  said Meyer, adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and
  15 pct in the preceding quarter.
      However, Hackmann said production could continue to exceed
  consumption.
      She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres came
  in southeastern states, where yields are usually low.
      ""We have the potential for record breaking soybean yields
  this year, (which) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow's
  opening,"" she said.
      Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible, and the
  crop could reach 7.1 billion bushels, which would be down from
  last year's 8.25 billion bushels.
      ""We'll need very good disappearance next year to reduce
  stocks,"" she said. The USDA estimated disappearance last year
  at 6.7 billion bushels.
      Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the long
  term, ""But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks down
  to where we could start rebuilding prices.""
      Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage report
  could prompt farmers to change their plans and plant more
  soybeans.
      The panelists agreed that the reports should discourage
  talk of revising the 1985 farm bill.
      ""There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm law
  we're working under today, and this report should reinforce
  that,"" Frazier said.
      ""We are seeing the program beginning to work,"" said Meyer.

  ""If we go on using up
  farmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in
  20 years to grow grain on.""
      Xu Jinfeng, a middle-aged official in Fengbang village on
  the edge of Shanghai, sums up the dilemma China faces as it
  tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same
  time let them get richer by building factories and new homes.
      China has to feed one quarter of the world's population,
  but only one seventh of its land is arable.
      Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into
  a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in
  1986.
      But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which
  has occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land for
  factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them.
      Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of
  its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller
  amount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during
  the two years.
      ""We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the
  industrialisation began,"" official Xu said. ""Since then, nearly
  all the families in the county have built new homes and many
  factories have gone up.""
      ""Last year we lost land to a new railway line,"" Xu said. But
  land losses in future should fall because nearly all families
  already have new houses, she added.
      The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the
  Peking leadership, which announced earlier this month that
  China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land
  for the first time this year.
      ""The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully,
  wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious,"" said
  an article in the official press explaining the new measures.
      ""It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland,"" it
  said. ""China has a large population and its land resources are
  badly deficient.""
      An official of the Shanghai city government said county
  authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of
  arable land to other uses, while anything more than that must
  be approved by the city government.
     The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its
  efforts to ensure China's people get enough grain to eat. The
  prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making
  it more profitable for them to grow other crops.
      To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser
  and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to
  buy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to
  China's 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise
  grain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it.
      Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the
  problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices.
      Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in the
  eastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened too
  much to the demands of ""selfish city people"" and could raise city
  grain prices without any problem.
      But the government has ruled out a price rise. ""Raising the
  price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social
  stability,"" said a China Daily editorial this month.
      The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the
  long term. ""We must be very careful. We have a very large
  population which is used to price stability and will object to
  price rises,"" he said. ""The problem is how to do it.""
      The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might
  also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with
  grain and consumed by city residents.
      In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate
  investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular.
      The official press has reported that farmers fear farm
  policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into
  building graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes.
      Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers sign
  contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops,
  but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land.
      ""As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at
  the halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about the
  future,"" the China Daily said in an editorial last month.
      Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to
  use the land but not own it. For most of the period of
  Communist rule, the land was organised into collectives where
  there was little room for individual initiative.
      ""New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency
  of government policies and make them interested in long-term
  investment,"" the newspaper said.

  The grain output of a major Chinese
  grain-producing province is not increasing, because farmers
  lack incentives, production costs are rising, storage
  facilities are poor and there is not enough state investment in
  grain, the province's vice-governor said.
      The China Daily quoted Yang Jike, vice-governor of Anhui,
  as saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton as
  they could growing grain, and three times as much growing cash
  crops like flax. He said production costs had risen to 40 pct
  of farmers' earnings, from 20 pct in 1982, and lower investment
  had caused the area of irrigated land to fall.
      Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pct
  of the province's total investment, from 26 pct in 1978.
      He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain was
  hit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year, and a
  further 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats.
      He said government measures to deal with the problem dealt
  with trifles, rather than the essentials. He called for more
  investment in grain production, an immediate ban on illegal use
  of or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called the
  tendency to rely on grain imports.
      The New China News Agency quoted Zhang Yan, a delegate to
  the National People's Congress, attacking grain policy. He said
  the government had cut agricultural investment to three to four
  pct from 11 pct.
      ""With the abundance of grain and cotton in the past few
  years, some people got carried away, relaxing their attention
  to grain and cotton production,"" he said.
      On Saturday, vice-premier Tian Jiyun said China aimed to be
  self-sufficient in grain. Now it exports corn from the
  northeast, but it imports wheat.
      ""Grain consumption is rising every year. Even if we reach
  the 1987 target of (405 mln tonnes), it cannot be considered
  adequate,"" Tian said.

      A department official attributed the increase to growing

  The Bundesbank should take further
  steps to reduce German interest rates to protect the mark from
  further appreciation and to persuade investors to bring
  long-term yields lower, Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> management
  board chairman Walter Seipp said.
      But he told the bank's annual news conference this did not
  mean a cut in leading interest rates, rather a reduction in
  money market rates through bringing the allocation rates down
  for Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements.
      ""Leading interest rates are not the decisive rates,"" he said.
  ""The money market rates are the important ones.""
      Seipp said the Bundesbank should move away from allocating
  money market liquidity at a fixed 3.8 pct as it has in recent
  tender allocations.
      An easier monetary policy would not mean a loss of
  credibility for the Bundesbank in its containment of monetary
  growth. A fall in short rates would make the public aware of
  the high yields in bonds and lead to a longer-term capital
  formation, braking the expansion of money supply.
      ""Thus, you can have lower rates and also a normalisation of
  monetary growth both at the same time,"" he added.
      Seipp said there were no grounds to paint too black a
  picture of the German economy, since company profitability had
  improved over recent years and domestic oriented firms were
  profiting from cheaper imports because of the rise in the mark.
      Growth this year should be at least one pct, he said,
  describing the downturn in production in the first months as a
  false start, unrepresentative of the rest of the year.
      After an economic contraction in the first quarter, the
  economy should show an uptrend in the last three. ""We don't
  believe that the economy has tipped over, but see it more as a
  'growth dip,'"" Seipp said.
      But Seipp also called for support for growth from fiscal
  policy, saying the top rate of income and corporate tax should
  be brought down to 49 pct. The current peak rate is 56 pct.
      The additional tax cuts brought forward to next January
  were no substitute for support for growth.
      Seipp added the federal government should make ""further
  courageous steps to decrease the state's proportion of the
  German economy and to increase its flexibility.""

  Government officials in Malaysia, a
  major cocoa producer, have declined to say whether it will join
  the International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA) for which buffer stock
  rules were agreed in London last week.
      Ministry of Primary Industries officials said in January
  the cabinet would decide on Malaysia's participation, but so
  far a decision has not been announced. The government is said
  to be in favour of joining the pact, but local cocoa growers
  and traders told Reuters they are against the idea because
  certain provisions in it may be to their disadvantage.
      Malaysia is the world's fourth largest cocoa producer. The
  government feels that the pact, through its buffer stock
  mechanism, can help stabilise prices in a market which is
  labouring under surpluses, officials said.
      But growers and traders are concerned Malaysia's
  participation in the pact will require them to pay a levy for
  exports of cocoa to non-member countries of the ICCA.
      They estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne at
  current prices and said they are not prepared to accept it
  because a big portion of Malaysia's cocoa exports, officially
  estimated at 112,000 tonnes in 1986, goes to non-members.
      Most growers and traders added they are also against a
  buffer stock measure under the agreement which requires
  withholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump.
      Malaysia, which produced 117,000 tonnes of cocoa last year,
  might be forced to withhold up to 70,000 tonnes worth some 30
  mln ringgit under such a measure in the long-term, and this
  might affect their economic viability, they said.
      ""The cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and it
  will be a real messy business for the government and the trade
  if it ever occurs,"" an industry source said.
      The growers and traders also said that under new buffer
  stock rules Malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is not
  a member of the pact, as the buffer stock manager is also
  allowed to buy from non-members for the stockpile.
      Under the new rules purchases from non-members, such as
  Malaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock.
      Malaysia has come under pressure from some producers to
  join the pact soon, officials said, but they noted that it need
  not rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countries
  to join the agreement even at a later date.

  International Coffee Organization, ICO,
  producers will meet at 1500 GMT (0900 est) for a general
  discussion of the market situation, producer spokesman
  Lindenberg Sette said.
      The Brazilian delegate said several producers requested the
  meeting but Brazil was not among them. The ICO executive
  board's regular session this week has so far been confined to
  routine matters, with no attempt by producers or consumers to
  revive export quota negotiations, delegates said.
      Talks to restore quotas collapsed early last month when
  producers and consumers failed to resolve differences on how
  quotas should be allocated.
      Producer delegates said there was no sense of urgency among
  producers to reopen quota talks with consumers, with most
  countries now prepared to wait for the ICO's annual September
  council session to restart negotiations.
      Members of the Inter-African Coffee Organization called for
  today's producer meeting to exchange views on the market
  situation, the producer delegates said.
      The lack of a new debate on export quotas here this week
  was cited as the reason for renewed weakness in coffee prices
  in London and New York futures, traders said.

  Kenya's economy will continue to expand
  this year and the government will do more to encourage
  investment by foreign firms and the local private sector,
  Planning Minister Robert Ouko said.
      He told a news conference that the government would soon
  create a special bureau to expedite processing of investment
  applications by local and foreign investors.
      Praising the role of multinational companies and local
  entrepreneurs in Kenya's economy, the minister promised to
  maintain a close working contact with the private sector.
      The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in
  1985, Ouko said.
      This was owing to high prices for the country's coffee
  exports, low oil prices, low inflation and rising real incomes,
  he added.
      ""Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices,
  Kenya's economy is still expected to improve in 1987,"" the
  planning minister said.
      ""High aggregate demand arising from low inflation, trade
  liberalisation and disciplined financial management are
  expected to increase output in the manufacturing sector,"" he
  said.
      Agriculture would expand significantly if favourable
  weather continued and farmers responded to producer price rises
  announced in February, the minister added.
      Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the
  long rainy season, which is due to start about now.
      Ouko said the production of Kenya's main cash crops
  increased during the second half of last year.
      Coffee deliveries to the state-run Coffee Board of Kenya
  rose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period,
  he said.
      Ouko paid tribute to the private sector for its
  contribution to the economy and promised to improve government
  cooperation with businessmen by maintaining regular contact
  with them.
      ""I wish to pay tribute to the private sector for its
  contribution to the economy in 1986 and challenge it to
  maintain the same spirit this year ... The manufacturing sector
  grew by an estimated 5.8 pct in 1986, in line with the same
  period the previous year,"" he said.
      Ouko said the ""one stop"" bureau was intended to stimulate
  investment and cut the time and bureacracy currently involved
  in processing applications.
      The planning minister presented a review of the Kenyan
  economy during the second half of 1986 which showed inflation
  falling to 4.3 pct from 10.2 a year earlier.
      This was owing to higher agricultural production and the
  Kenyan shilling's relative strength against other major
  currencies, the report said.
      The average exchange rate was 16.23 shillings per U.S. Dlr
  last year, a fall of only 1.2 pct from 16.432 in 1985. The half
  yearly report said exports increased about 30 pct in
  July-December 1986, while imports rose by only six pct during
  the period.
      This gave Kenya an overall balance of payments surplus of
  780 mln Kenya shillings (48 mln dlrs) during the period,
  compared with a 1.4 billion shilling (87 mln dlr) deficit in
  the second half of 1985, it said.

  The USDA quarterly hogs and pig report
  yesterday showed more hogs on U.S. farms compared to last year
  as profitability resulting from low grain prices encouraged
  producers to step up production, analysts said.
      Most analysts seemed to agree with Chicago Mercantile
  Exchange floor traders that the report will be viewed as
  bearish to pork futures and futures prices may open sharply
  lower today. Some traders and analysts expect limit declines in
  nearby contracts, with spillover selling likely in cattle.
      University of Missouri agronomist Glen Grimes said,""The
  report shows that hog producers have responded to a very
  desirable feeding ratio that they enjoyed for the past 10
  months.""
      Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt said hog futures
  prices are above producers' break even points. Even if futures
  fell the daily limit of 1.50 cents today, producers could still
  lock in a profit, which increases the likelihood of heavy
  selling pressure today.
      ""We have not had a period of profitability of this
  magnitude since last summer,"" Levitt said. ""In fact, hog
  operations on many mixed livestock/grain enterprises have been
  so profitable that it actually enabled some farmers to get back
  on their feet and refinance their loans just based on the hog
  operation alone.""
      Levitt said the weight breakdown in the report also was
  negative, in that some lead time was anticipated before the
  slaughter increased from the previous year.
      We expected farmers to increase hog operations, but we
  didn't expect this degree of expansion to show up in a 10-state
  spring report, Levitt added.
      High hog corn ratios (the number of bushels of corn that
  could be bought for 100 lbs of hog) and the resulting increased
  profits, encouraged farmers and confinement operations to
  increase production starting late last year.
      Analysts also noted that part of the increase in the hog
  herd resulted from a revision of the December report and
  without the revision, the March report might have been very
  close to average expectations.
      Robin Fuller of Agri Analysis said the USDA made a major
  upward revision of 105,000 head in the size of the breeding
  herd in the December 1 report. So the December report was more
  bearish than initially indicated.
      But Fuller, as well as other analysts, expected the report
  to be less negative on deferred futures contracts. Distant
  contracts are already at a sharp discount to cash because
  traders anticipated high farrowing intentions, she noted.
      Discounts in the October and December contracts take into
  consideration a six to seven pct increase in March/May
  farrowing intentions, which was borne out in the March 1
  report, Fuller said.
      Grimes said, ""As far as the distant months are concerned,
  if our first quarter pig crop is up only six pct and under 60
  lb inventories actually up only five pct, it would take a
  tremendous discount in price for each percent increase for us
  to push down to the prices that the current futures show for
  the July and August period.""
      Jerry Abbenhaus, analyst for AGE Clearing noted that
  distant futures prices are already 15 to 20 dlrs lower than
  they were last summer.
      ""If cash hogs at the 7-markets last year averaged 61 dlrs
  during July, that doesn't mean hogs have to be 15 dlrs cheaper
  this year because we have six pct more numbers,"" he said.

  entrepreneurs in Kenya's economy, the minister promised to
  maintain a close working contact with the private sector.
      The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in
  1985, Ouko said. This was owing to high prices for the
  country's coffee exports, low oil prices, low inflation and
  rising real incomes, he added.
      ""Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices,
  Kenya's economy is still expected to improve in 1987,"" the
  planning minister said.
      Agriculture would expand significantly if favourable
  weather continued and farmers responded to producer price rises
  announced in February, the minister added.
      Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the
  long rainy season, which is due to start about now.
      Ouko said the production of Kenya's main cash crops
  increased during the second half of last year.
      Coffee deliveries to the state-run Coffee Board of Kenya
  rose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period,
  he said.

  Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman
  De Croo said if Congress passed legislation curbing world
  textile imports the only way the European Community (EC) could
  react was to retaliate.
      De Croo said at a news conference ""if you limit textile
  imports, you will re-orient textiles to Europe.""
      And that he said would trigger EC taxes on U.S. goods.
      Congress passed a textile bill two years ago, but it was
  vetoed by President Reagan on grounds that curbing imports to
  protect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliation
  U.S. trading partners.
      A similar bill has been introducted this year, in a
  Congress with a bigger Democratic majority and with a President
  weakened by the Iran scandal.
      De Croo, here for talks with Administration officials and
  Congressmen, said if a textile bill passed, ""the only way we
  could react would be retaliation, and it would cause more
  retaliation, which is not a good way to deal with problems.""
      He said if a textile bill was enacted, ""we will impose taxes
  on a lot of American products.""  He said ""it would be stupid. We
  have to avoid that.""
      He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan, because of
  its massive trade suprlus with the United States, and not with
  EC nations, but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted 
  shipments of Asian textiles.
      De Croo also criticized the way U.S. officials try to solve
  EC trade issues, saying ""each time we come in contact, it a
  conflict contact. The clouts are coming fom the West.""
      He said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials cross

  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter said the United States and Argentina have settled a 
  case brought by the U.S. soybean crushing industry alleging
  unfair subsidies to Argentina's crushing industry.
      Speaking to an Agribusiness Education forum here late
  yesterday, Yeutter said the case was resolved at a meeting with
  Argentine Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figuerras during a
  trade ministers' meeting in New Zealand last week.
      Under a verbal understanding between the two ministers,
  Argentina will soon abolish export taxes on soybeans and
  products, U.S. and Argentine officials said.
      The U.S. case brought by the U.S. National Soybean
  Processors Association alleged Argentina, through differential
  export taxes, implicitly subsidized domestic soybean crushers.
      The U.S. crushing industry, in its complaint under Section
  301 of trade law, said higher Argentine export taxes on
  soybeans than on products encourage the export of products and
  represented an unfair trade practice.
      Yeutter told Figuerras that all agencies of the U.S.
  government supported the U.S. complaint and unless Argentina
  took steps to eliminate the taxes, the United States would
  consider taking further action in the case, U.S. and Argentine
  officials said.
      An Argentine official here said no timetable was given for
  removal of the Argentine export taxes.

  Speculation the United States will
  offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have
  reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of
  State George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.
      Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat
  markets since officials from the two countries held their
  customary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow's
  decision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market
  strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.
      Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.
      Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in
  the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement
  Program, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit to
  Moscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representatives
  here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was
  preparing an offer.
      Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.
  Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped
  about the prospects of a subsidy offer.
      But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the
  contention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,
  while not a ""done deal,"" is a live possibility.
      Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whom
  asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an
  offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.
      Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,
  are saying they would not rule one out.
      Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as to
  predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days
  to two weeks.
      Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders
  who had been in contact with administration officials.
      Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.
  Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancement
  offer would be made by the middle of this month.
      Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end
  up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this
  year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs
  per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.
      Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat
  subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of
  U.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.
      As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal
  would appear to be price.
      Last summer the administration took the controversial step
  of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were
  embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds
  that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices
  far above world market prices.
      The administration's decision to set the subsidy level up
  front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a
  means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen
  criticism, grain trade sources said.
      Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz
  from saying the Soviets were ""chortling"" because Washington was
  offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to
  U.S. housewives.
      The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives
  here is that a general warming of relations between the two
  countries since last summer, combined with continued hard times
  in the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.
      In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider
  buying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.
      However, observers have not forgotten the circumstances
  surrounding the administration's announcement of the wheat
  subsidy offer last summer.
      Up until the time of the announcment, congressional and
  industry leaders were led to believe the White House had
  decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not
  only the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.
      Instead, the administration scaled back the offer to
  include only the Soviets.
      That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of
  uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced
  that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to
  sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

  House Ways and Means Committee
  Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation
  to pass a protectionist trade bill this year.
      In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press
  Club, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislation
  will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year.
      But he warned that his ""conciliatory message"" on the trade

  other countries their access to the American market would be
  curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods.
      ""Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a

  Rostenkowski said.
      ""It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied
  us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the
  American market,"" he added.
      However, he said there would likely be changes in the

  foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face

  The restoration of coffee export quotas
  before the end of the current 1986/87 coffee year (Oct 1/Sept
  30) now seems unlikely, given reluctance by International
  Coffee Organization, ICO, producers and consumers to resume
  negotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegates
  told reporters.
      Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening the
  quota dialogue while Brazil's position remains unchanged, they
  said.
      Brazil's refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30
  pct share of the ICO's global export quota effectively
  torpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotas
  before October, the delegates noted.
      Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced
  coffee futures in London and New York to new lows today,
  traders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr in
  early trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said.
      Producer delegates said that while the possibility of
  reimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, in
  practice the idea had effectively been discarded.
      The ICO's executive board session here this week has so far
  barely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating general
  unwillingness to revive talks while chances of success are
  still remote, producer delegates said.
      Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored,
  despite the price collapse seen since the failure of last
  month's negotiations, they said.
      ""With Brazil's frost season approaching, who wants to
  negotiate quotas,"" one leading producer delegate said.
      Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil's frost season
  (mainly June-August) as dealers and roasters build up stocks as
  insurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil's
  crop.
      Many producers are more interested in working towards
  reimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system of
  quota allocations valid until the International Coffee
  Agreement expires in 1989, they said.
      Guatemala has already proposed the ""other oilds"" producer
  group should meet in the next two months to begin talks on how
  to allocate quota shares.
      Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quota
  distribution system, with some producer delegates reporting
  growing support for a radical reallocation, based on the
  principle of ""objective criteria"" favoured by consumers.
      At last month's council session a splinter group of small
  producers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based on
  exportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia and
  the rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocations
  unchanged, except for some temporary adjustments.
      A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now
  supported their cause.
      The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed
  readiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quota
  accord in October also looked bleak.
      The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined to
  make reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution of
  quota shares based on ""objective criteria.""
      ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would be
  prepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meets
  in September.
      Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external
  debt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee,
  they said.
      They said Brazil's reluctance to open coffee export
  registrations might reflect fears this would provoke another
  price slide and force an emergency ICO council session, which
  would most likely end in failure.
      Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation
  but had only a general discussion about how further
  negotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said.
      Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and then
  may set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are not
  fixed, he said.
      The ICO executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local time
  to hear a report from consultants on ICO operations. The board
  meeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled,
  delegates said.

  The U.S. Has been promised a near

  EC official said.
      The official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters that
  the guarantee was given in an unpublished clause of the

  High feed prices will cause the
  Chinese to reduce hog herd growth and pork production this
  year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
  said hog numbers at the start of 1987 were estimated at 331.6
  mln head, up slightly from 1986, and 10 mln head above earlier
  projections for 1987.
      Pork production in 1986 was up 4.2 pct to 17.25 mln tonnes,
  slightly below earlier estimates, it said.
      For 1987, production is projected to fall to 17.05 mln
  tonnes.
      Feed prices at the end of January were reported 35 to 40
  pct above year-ago levels, the department said.

  Export Credits Guarantee Department has
  named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's
  Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17
  years, to the post of executive director, a department
  spokesman said.
      Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57.
      A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt
  to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent
  years.
      Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top
  convern, adding that the department may have to compete more
  aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar
  services.
      The department's annual report for the year ended March 31,
  1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7
  billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt
  to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg.
      Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among
  his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser
  developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports.
      The agency will have to review its policies on insuring
  export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis,
  he said. ""Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of
  thing we want to take a look at.""
      ""You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in
  a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing,""
  Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will
  strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance
  recipients.
      He noted that certain countries have already been removed
  from the list.

  Visible stocks of 17 oils and fats are
  probably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by October
  1 this year, the Oil World newsletter said.
      Oil World forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cut
  to only 9.8 mln tonnes at the end of this season, compared with
  10.6 mln a year earlier.
      Its survey covered  13 oils -- soy, cotton, groundnut, sun,
  rape, sesame, corn, olive, coconut, palmkernel, palm, lin and
  castor  -- and four animal oils and fats -- butter, fish oil,
  lard and tallow/greases.
      Oil World's analysis predicted only a slight production
  increase of 0.5 mln tonnes in the year to end-September 1987,
  compared with increases of 3.6 mln and 4.0 mln tonnes in the
  previous two seasons.
      It said world consumption was continuing to rise. Unusually
  low prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demand
  for both food and non-food purposes, it said.
      World consumption  could increase by a record 2.8 mln
  tonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higher
  if the Indian government did not artificially curb domestic
  demand.
      Oil World said it did not expect the European Community
  (EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax, but if such a tax were
  introduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption.

  Coffee producing countries must quickly
  map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the
  International Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement on
  export quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's private
  coffee exporters' association, said.
      Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now
  would be to seek a unifying stand from producers, including
  Brazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices.
      An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with
  exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a
  resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after
  prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil.
      Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but
  predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly
  plummet.
      However, he said the market should also take into account
  evident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of the
  near totality of the Central American crop.
      Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at
  1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past
  10 years.
      Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand
  the true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nations
  as well as for industrialized countries.
      It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to
  solve the problem of the developing world's external debt,
  decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying
  those debts, he said.
      ""In Colombia's case, we watch with consternation that,
  while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countries
  which support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein,""
  Cardenas said.

  Drilling of this year's British sugar

      This compares with two pct at the same stage last year,
  three pct in 1985 and 38 to 39 pct in 1984.
      There is little cause for concern with better weather
  forecast and the capacity available to drill the contracted

  look good and farmers are advised to wait for soil temperatures

  Soviet imports of soymeal may reach or
  exceed one mln tonnes between January and September this year,
  the Oil World newsletter said.
      Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reduce
  soybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal.
      At least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from the
  European Community and South America in the January/March
  quarter, with additional large quantities likely to be imported
  in the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil, it
  said. No figures were given for imports in the corresponding
  periods of 1986.
      The change made sense in view of the recent purchases of
  probably 250,000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseed
  and large scale butter imports that were expected from March
  onward, it said.
      Oil World said substantial losses of Soviet winter grain
  area due to recent severe frosts were probably behind the
  recent pick-up in Soviet purchases of U.S. Corn.
      It noted that an additional one mln tonnes of U.S. Corn had

  Fresh, heavy rains caused further
  damage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the week
  to yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, trade
  sources said.
      They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum crops
  were damaged and yield estimates affected. New production
  forecasts were made for all these crops.
      The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered
  more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and
  worsened the flooding in various parts of the province.
      The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aires
  have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue.
      The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains.
      In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of
  200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres area
  bordering on Uruguay.
      In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm
  in places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm.
      The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa.
      Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be
  further delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said.
      The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the
  crops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added.
      Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to
  30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa and
  Buenos Aires provinces.
      The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has been
  lowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6
  mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lower
  than the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season.
      The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to
  36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86.
      The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the
  area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. It
  will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weather
  permitting.
      Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mln
  tonnes, against last week's 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4
  to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private
  producers put 1985/86 production.
      The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the official
  figure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season's production.
      The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers'
  targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week.
      The production forecast was reduced to between three and
  3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4
  to 26.8 pct down on last season's 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.
      The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mln
  hectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86.
      The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least
  changed in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to
  7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes.
      These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season's
  record of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources,
  and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes.
      The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the
  rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the
  sunlight needed for this crop, sources said.
      Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down
  further.
      The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still
  finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier
  in the season.
      Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southern
  Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires.

  New York coffee futures prices will
  probably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before a
  consolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts.
      Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00
  dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the
  International Coffee Organization did not place new export
  quota discussions on its current agenda.
      Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after five
  years of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February.
      ""Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents,
  perhaps 85 cents,"" said William O'Neill, coffee analyst with
  Elders Futures. ""But the additional downside may not be all
  that great from current levels.""
      ""At this price level the market is very vulnerable to
  bullish developments,"" O'Neill added. ""Rather than us having a
  market that will plummet we'll kind of see prices erode --
  probably to around 85 cents.""
      ""I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief
  drop to 85 cents,"" said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst with
  Prudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freeze
  in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor,
  with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time.
      A trader at a major international trade house, who asked
  not to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but
  believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high
  export price and requires a high contribution quota from
  exporters the market could steady at the lower levels.
      Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on
  Brazil to agree to consumers' export quota terms, and a new
  international agreement could come into force next fall.
      Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen
  from about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb
  today, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and
  demand.
      Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of
  stocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will
  need to do some buying soon.
      ""Most producing nations have just completed or are about to
  complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at
  their seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and
  warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly
  overburdened,"" said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson
  Lehman, in that firm's forthcoming quarterly coffee report.
      Kaul said producers' need to procure hard currency to
  service foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell,
  and ""this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to
  undertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows.""
      Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before
  Brazil's frost season begins in June.
      Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by,
  though analysts note the peak winter consumption period is
  passed and demand usually slows this time of year.
      Shearson's Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as of
  January 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bags
  compared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdown
  for the usually busy winter roasting season.
      But Elders O'Neill said, ""The roasters are not overstocked
  by any means.""
      Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult,
  given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory
  below the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and several
  traders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short
  term.

  House Ways and Means Committee
  Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back
  the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support.
      He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a
  number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought
  a tax increase to help balance the budget.
      However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates
  enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.
      There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the
  1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year.
      Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his
  1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax
  increases.
      On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the
  major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry
  for special protection.
      ""To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide,""
  he said.
      This apparently ruled out congressional approval of another
  textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as was
  proposed again this year.

  The Soviet Union would likely be more
  interested in purchasing new crop wheat than in booking any
  grain for immediate shipment if offered a subsidy on U.S.
  wheat, an executive with a major grain export company said.
      Lower prices and the desire to delay any big purchases
  until the condition of winter and spring crops is better known
  make new crop wheat more attractive, said George Hoffman,
  director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company.
      ""Pillsbury is assuming that they (Soviets) will be offered
  a subsidy and that it will be a subsidy that they can respond
  to,"" Hoffman told Reuters in an interview at an agribusiness
  education conference here. But if there are too many
  constraints placed on a subsidy offer, the USSR will take less
  than an anticipated four mln tonnes, he said.
      Hoffman said Pillsbury's internal statistics put Soviet
  Union wheat purchases at only two mln tonnes under a subsidy
  offer. However, if a subsidy is offered at competitive levels,
  Moscow would likely buy more, he said.
      ""If we give the Soviets the same deal as the Chinese, I
  expect they'll take it,"" said Vernon McMinimy, director of
  commodity research for A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.
      McMinimy told Reuters spring weather and its impact on
  crops will determine how much wheat Moscow would buy under a
  subsidy offer.
      Soviet winter crops did not get off to a good start because
  of a dry autumn last year, and because of the severe winter
  ""they probably have had more damage due to winter weather than
  normal,"" McMinimy said.

  The U.S. House Agriculture Committee
  approved proposals to extend the life of the Export Enhancement
  Program, EEP, through fiscal 1990 and urged the Reagan
  administration offer EEP wheat to the Soviet Union.
      The proposals were approved as amendments to a
  comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year.
      In addition to the amendments on EEP, the committee
  approved several proposals which could restrict imports of
  lamb, casein, sugar-containing products and tobacco. Those
  amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because
  the House Ways and Means Committee, which has overall
  jurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them,
  Congressional sources said.
      The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the
  life of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than
  the current three years through fiscal 1988.
      The amendments, offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., also
  would increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from
  1.5 billion now.
      Furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered by
  Rep. Glickman which instructs the U.S. Agriculture Department
  to value EEP bonus commodities at market value, not acquisition
  value. Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct
  less expensive to operate.
      The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union, offered by
  Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., does not require the administration
  make an offer, but urges such action.
      The committee approved an amendment, offered by Rep. Glenn
  English, D-Okla., requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to
  begin discussions with other major grain producing countries
  aimed at jointly reducing world grain production.
      Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed the
  amendment, saying such commodity agreements do not work.
      Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approved
  by the panel, the most significant would require quotas on
  imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm
  product that is subject to U.S. quotas. The amendment, offered
  by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is aimed primarily at
  curbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and
  foreign foods containing dairy products. It also may affect
  peanut, cotton and tobacco imports, Committee sources said.
      Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports of
  casein, a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by New
  Zealand and Ireland.
      The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same
  countercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S.
  beef imports.
      Other miscellaneous amendments included:
      -- Urging the administration consider retaliating against
  Japan and South Korea if those countries do not remove
  restrictions on beef imports.
      -- Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shipped
  each year under a food aid program called Section 416 to
  800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now.
      -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study of
  the Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat to
  determine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier.
      -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse the
  National Corn Growers Association up to 500,000 dlrs for the
  costs of defending the U.S. feedgrains program against a
  Canadian countervailing duty case this year.
      -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decision
  to apply a duty on U.S. corn imports, and a proposal by the
  European Community to apply a vegetable oils tax.
      -- USDA conduct a study of the findings of a National
  Commission on Agricultural Export Policy, which recommended a

  about 30 pct of its total annual exports.
      Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue if
  there are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members who
  offer higher prices than non-members, he said.
      The Customs Department said Thailand exported 21,404 tonnes
  of coffee last year, up from 20,602 in 1985.
      Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25,000
  tonnes in the 1986/87 (Oct/Sept) season from 28,000 the

      Somphol Kiatpaiboon, director general of the Commercial

  West German industrial production,
  seasonally adjusted, rose a provisional 3.2 pct in February
  after a downwards revised decline of 3.4 pct in January, the
  Economics Ministry said.
      The ministry had originally estimated that industrial
  production fell 3.0 pct in January.
      The February figure is likely to be revised upwards by just
  under one percentage point next month when the March figure is
  released, a ministry statement said.
      The industrial production index, base 1980, stood at a
  provisional 104.1 in February against 100.9 in January and
  104.5 in December. The ministry had previously put the January
  and December indices at 101.6 and 104.7 respectively.
      In February 1986 the output index had stood at 103.7,
  producing a year-on-year rise for February 1987 of 0.4 pct.
      The February rise in production was aided by a sharp 19 pct
  increase in construction output compared with January, when
  production in many industrial sectors was depressed by
  unusually severe winter weather.
      Manufacturing industry registered a 3-1/2 pct rise in
  production in February compared with January. But energy sector
  output fell nine pct and mining production declined seven pct.
      The ministry, which considers two-monthly comparisons to be
  a better guide to trends, said output in January and February
  together fell around two pct against November and December.
      The ministry said construction output fell 13-1/2 pct in
  January/February against November/December due to the cold
  January weather. Output in the energy sector rose four pct and
  mining output 10 pct.
      Manufacturing industry's production fell 1-1/2 pct in
  January/February compared with November/December.
      Within this sector, the output of both basic products and
  of food, tobacco and alcohol fell 1-1/2 pct. Production of
  capital goods fell 2-1/2 pct while output of consumer goods was
  unchanged.
      Compared with the same months of 1986, industrial
  production in January and February 1987 fell 1-1/2 pct, the
  ministry said.
      Manufacturing industry output fell one pct, with output of
  basic products down three pct, capital goods down one pct and
  food, tobacco and alcohol production 1-1/2 pct lower. Makers of
  consumer goods posted a 1-1/2 pct year-on-year rise in the
  two-month period.
      In other industrial sectors, mining production fell four
  pct and construction output 4-1/2 pct. The energy sector saw a
  slight 1/2 pct rise, the ministry added.

  Taiwan said its foreign reserves suffered
  about 3.4 billion U.S. Dlrs in exchange rate losses from July
  1986 to February 1987 as a result of the rise of the Taiwan
  dollar against the U.S. Currency.
      Yu Chien-ming, head of the government statistics
  department, told parliament yesterday he expected the losses to
  increase as the Taiwan dollar continues to strengthen.
      The Taiwan dollar, which opened at 34.24 to the U.S. Dollar
  today, has risen about 16 pct against the U.S. Unit since
  September 1985. Some bankers expect it to rise to 33 by June
  and to 32 by the end of this year.
      Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves now total 53 billion
  dlrs. At end-February they were 52.1 billion dlrs, the world's
  third largest after West Germany and Japan.
      Yu said the interest earned from the reserves totalled
  about 1.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from July 1986 to February 1987.
  The reserves are managed by the central bank and deposited at
  about 170 leading banks in the U.S., Japan, Britain, Canada and
  Singapore.
      About 75 pct of the reserves are in the form of cash,
  mostly in U.S. Dollars. The rest are in government treasury

  Australia is risking wheat export
  sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet
  buyer requirements, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said.
      ""Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly quality
  conscious, demanding strict adherence to contractual quality
  specifications,"" the board said in a submission to the Royal
  Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport.
      ""Many of the specifications are more specific than the
  current categories used in Australia,"" it said.
      The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs
  and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system.
      Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market
  share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but
  lower-quality grades, the AWB submission said.
      It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every
  stage from receival to shipping.
      Better industrial relations at grain terminals, more
  uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock
  control were vital to improved marketing, it said.
      The submission also said Australia's federal system impeded
  the AWB's role of coordinating and managing the marketing of
  wheat.
      The AWB called for an end to physical and legislative
  constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient
  transport of grains to other states for shipment.
      ""It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode
  to the nearest efficient port, irrespective of the state in
  which the wheat is grown or stored,"" it said.
      For example, wheat grown in northern New South Wales (NSW)
  might move more efficiently to Brisbane, in Queensland, than to
  Sydney or Newcastle in New South Wales, it said. Similarly,
  southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland or
  Geelong, in Victoria.
      Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly over
  grain shipments was one notable impediment, it said.
      The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulk
  handling authorities is not essential, although it said it
  favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current
  level of control of storage and transport as long as quality
  was maintained.
      An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between
  26,500 and 34,700 U.S. Dlrs to load a 50,000-tonne vessel at
  various Australian ports compared with 21,200 dlrs at Houston
  and 16,300 at Port Cartier, Quebec, for a 60,000-tonner.

  The maximum rebate granted at
  yesterday's European Community (EC) sugar tender marked no
  change in policy towards producers' complaints that they are
  losing money on exports outside the EC, EC commission sources
  said.
      They said this was despite the fact that the commission
  accepted over 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention
  yesterday from traders protesting that rebates are being set
  too low.
      The maximum rebate at yesterday's tender was 46.864 Ecus
  per 100 kilos, up from 45.678 Ecus the previous week.
      London traders said yesterday the rebate was the largest
  ever granted. The commission sources said today the increase
  was entirely explained by world market conditions. The amount
  by which the rebate fell short of what producers claim is
  needed to obtain an equivalent price to that for sales into
  intervention remained at 0.87 Ecus per 100 kilos, they said.
      Operators offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar into
  intervention last month to protest at rebates which they said
  were too low. The sources said about 706,470 tonnes of French
  sugar and 79,000 tonnes of German sugar had been accepted, the
  remainder being rejected as of too low quality.
      The sources noted the operators could withdraw their offers
  in the five week period between the acceptance of the sugar and
  payment for it.
      They said they saw no sign of planned withdrawals as yet,
  adding that they would expect operators to wait another week or
  two to review commission policy before making up their minds.
      The sources said the commission felt entitled to offer
  rebates at slightly below the level theoretically justifiable
  in the light of its 1987/88 farm price package proposal to
  reduce guaranteed prices for sugar by two pct from the start of
  the new season in July.

  Economics Ministry said.
      The ministry had originally estimated that industrial
  production fell 3.0 pct in January.
      The February figure is likely to be revised upwards by just
  under one percentage point next month when the March figure is
  released, a ministry statement said.
      The industrial production index, base 1980, stood at a
  provisional 104.1 in February against 100.9 in January and
  104.5 in December. The ministry had previously put the January
  and December indices at 101.6 and 104.7 respectively.
      In February 1986 the output index had stood at 103.7,
  producing a year-on-year rise for February 1987 of 0.4 pct.
      The February rise in production was aided by a sharp 19 pct
  increase in construction output compared with January, when
  production in many industrial sectors was depressed by
  unusually severe winter weather.
      Manufacturing industry registered a 3-1/2 pct rise in
  production in February compared with January. But energy sector
  output fell nine pct and mining production declined seven pct.
      The ministry, which considers two-monthly comparisons to be
  a better guide to trends, said output in January and February
  together fell around two pct against November and December.
      The ministry said construction output fell 13-1/2 pct in
  January/February against November/December due to the cold
  January weather. Output in the energy sector rose four pct and
  mining output 10 pct.
      Manufacturing industry's production fell 1-1/2 pct in
  January/February compared with November/December.
      Within this sector, the output of both basic products and
  of food, tobacco and alcohol fell 1-1/2 pct. Production of
  capital goods fell 2-1/2 pct while output of consumer goods was
  unchanged.

  Japan is sending a three-man team to
  Washington to try to halt threatened trade sanctions that
  officials warn could spark a wave of anti-U.S. Sentiment here.
      The team will lay the groundwork for high-level emergency
  talks next week aimed at defusing an increasingly bitter row
  over trade in computer microchips, officials said.
      ""The sanctions are against the free trade system,"" Ministry
  of International Trade and Industry (MITI) director general
  Noboru Hatakeyama told reporters, adding: ""If these measures are
  taken, the atmosphere in Japan against the United States would
  become not so good as before.""
      Other officials were more blunt. ""The U.S. Action will have
  a significant impact on the growing anti-U.S. Feeling (here),""
  another MITI official said.
      A senior Foreign Ministry official, who declined to be
  identified, told Reuters the U.S. Threats have undercut those
  in the government who argue for conciliation.
      ""There is a very strong argument in Japan that since the
  United States is imposing tariffs unilaterally, why should we
  bother doing anything,"" he said. ""Anything we do, we will be
  bashed.""
      The senior official sounded pessimistic about the
  likelihood of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defusing U.S.
  Anger over Japanese trade practices when he visits Washington
  on April 29.
      ""I don't think trade friction will be solved all of a sudden
  (by the visit),"" he said.
      Nakasone is widely expected to present a package of
  measures to President Reagan to help contain U.S. Frustration
  over Japan's large trade surplus.
      But the senior official played down those expectations.

  Japan is doing all it can to solve its
  trade problems with the United States but the two nations will
  remain at odds as long as the trade account is lopsided in
  Japan's favour, a senior official said.
      ""So long as there is an external imbalance there will be
  trade friction and ...Harsh words between the two governments,""
  the Foreign Ministry official told reporters.
      Last year, Japan racked up a 51.5 billion dlr surplus with
  the United States and economists said they do not see it
  falling significantly any time soon.
      Washington announced plans last week to slap up to 300 mln
  dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, raising the
  spectre of a trade war between the two countries.
      ""We take the current situation very seriously,"" said the
  official, who declined to be identified. ""The basic stance of
  the Japanese government is to tackle the issues with all
  available resources.""
      The United States has accused Japan of reneging on an
  agreement that called on it to stop selling cut-price computer
  microchips in world markets and to try to import more American
  semiconductors. Tokyo has denied the charges.
      The Foreign Ministry official refused to rule out Japanese
  retaliation if America went ahead with its threatened tariffs
  in the middle of this month. But he said that any response
  would be in accordance with international law and Japan's
  international obligations.
      He added that both Japan and the United States must take
  account of the impact of their dispute on their own and the
  world economy.

  Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio said
  the central bank was worried that money supply was growing too

      In testimony to the economic commission of Congress, Rubio
  said the main measure of money supply, the broad-based Liquid
  Assets in Public Hands, grew at an estimated annualised rate of
  17 pct in March, the same as in February.
      The bank's target range for growth in this measure in 1987
  is 6.5 to 9.5 pct, compared with 11.4 pct last year.
      Rubio said he was aiming for the lower end of the range.
      He added that real GDP growth of three pct in 1986 was due
  to a six pct increase in real internal demand and a three pct
  real drop in the contribution of the external sector.
      The aim for 1987 was for the same real growth in GDP but a
  drop in the internal contribution to 4.5 pct with the negative

  Canadian economic growth is expected to

      ""The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth
  over the course of 1987,"" said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at
  Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd.
      Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product,
  grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion,
  but down from 1985's four pct.
      In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized
  rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the
  third quarter.
      ""Essentially it is a flat performance,"" said Warren Jestin,
  deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.
      Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson
  Bongard Inc said ""it shows the economy is not moving along very
  steadily, it's not a very promising number.""
      ""We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter
  in Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession,"" she
  added.
      The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by
  Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last
  month. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this
  year.
      Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will
  likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range.
      Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade
  performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in
  the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs
  from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.
      ""The sharp increase in the deficit originated from
  merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to
  advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged,"" the
  federal agency said in a statement.
      The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion
  dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.
      But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S.
  economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and
  help fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of
  Canada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year.

  over a new labour agreement, began on Wednesday when grain
  handlers stopped work.
      Van der Vorm said that if strikes continued on today's
  scale for some time vessels coming to unload grain in Rotterdam
  would face delays, but this was not happening yet.
      Wednesday's actions left GEM's facilities 40 pct
  operational, and there were only limited strikes yesterday.
      Talks between unions and employers yesterday and today
  produced no result, but FNV spokesman Bert Duim said the union
  was prepared to put their key demand, for a 36 hour working
  week, at the bottom of the agenda.
      Van der Vorm said, however, the union's demands on a range
  of issues were far in excess of the management's final offer.

  Swiss inflation is likely to rise in 1987
  and 1988 because of inflationary tendencies in the domestic
  economy, the Centre for Economic Research of the Federal
  Institute of Technology said in its spring review.
      It forecast a rise in consumer prices of two pct in 1988
  compared with 1.3 pct in 1987. Low import prices in 1986 helped
  to keep annual inflation down to 0.8 pct.
      The centre said that in general the outlook for the Swiss
  economy in 1987 and 1988 remained favourable, despite the more
  difficult international economic climate facing export
  industry.
      The centre repeated its previous forecast that growth in
  Swiss domestic product would slow to 2.2 pct in 1987 from 2.5
  pct in 1986. It revised its forecast for 1988 GDP growth to 1.7
  pct from 1.6 pct in its last autumn review.
      Domestic demand will continue to replace exports as the
  motor of economic growth. Private consumption will grow by
  three pct in 1987 and two pct in 1988 against 3.75 pct in 1986.
      Growth in goods exports will slow to 1.75 pct in 1987 from
  2.1 pct in 1986 but pick up slightly to 2.5 pct in 1988. All
  three figures are well below the Swiss average for recent
  years. In 1985, for example, exports increased by 9.1 pct.
      The centre said the strength of the Swiss franc, which has
  firmed sharply in recent months, would continue to put pressure
  on Swiss exporters.
      It forecast that imports of goods would grow by a more
  modest 4.5 pct in 1987 and 3.25 pct in 1988 than in 1986, when
  import prices fell substantially and imports rose by 8.2 pct.
      Industrial production will grow by 1.6 pct in 1987 and 1.2
  pct in 1988 compared with 4.2 pct in 1986.

  A Swedish Finance Ministry committee
  forecast that British Petroleum Plc &lt;BP.L> may have to close
  its refinery in Gothenburg because of an anticipated worsening
  of the Swedish petroleum industry's competitiveness.
      It said in a report that the future of the Swedish refining
  business was bleak due to the steady drop in domestic oil
  consumption since the mid-1970s, a possible tightening of rules
  on sulphur content and competition from Norway's Mongstad
  facility of &lt;Den Norske Stats Olieselskab> (Statoil) &lt;STAT.OL>
  when its expansion is completed in the 1990s.
      The committee said the BP refinery, which lacks a
  de-sulphurisation plant, was likely to be closed or sold unless
  costly investments were made to enhance the facility's capacity
  to refine a broader range of products.
      But the committee noted that capacity utilisation had in
  recent years been above that of the European refining industry
  on average. The BP plant, in which Sweden's state-owned &lt;OK

  The recent fall in world sugar prices,
  due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export
  availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China
  and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said.
      Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of
  China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should
  limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly
  market report.
     ""And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return
  to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for
  May/June shipment, Man added.
      The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May
  shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total
  purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said.
      Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln
  tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5
  mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being
  countered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3
  mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier.
      Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could
  be close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar
  production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down.
      Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks
  in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to
  boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not
  be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates
  Cuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln
  tonnes.
      However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters
  with reduced availability, Man said.
      Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen
  to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time free
  market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which
  has left exporters chasing falling import requirements.
      A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the
  difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still
  remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is
  needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still
  overhanging the market, Man said.
      The increasing cases of record production as a result of
  record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers
  to strive for greater efficiency.
      As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of
  production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to
  prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said.
      Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and
  sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the
  level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully
  compensate producers when exporting on the world market.
      Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugar
  is expected to remain in intervention, it added.

  Spain has revised some of its main
  economic targets for 1987 after studying the performance of the
  economy in the first quarter, the economy ministry said in its
  monthly bulletin.
      Internal demand is now forecast to rise four pct against a
  previous target of 3.5 pct.
      Mariano Rubio, governor of the Bank of Spain, the central
  bank, yesterday said internal demand was currently growing at
  an annual rate of six pct and it had to be brought down to four
  pct if the government were to meet its five pct inflation
  target this year. Inflation was 8.3 pct in 1986.
      The forecast for private consumption growth remains
  unchanged at three pct, although public consumption is revised
  upwards to 2.5 pct from 2.0 pct.
      Growth in domestic demand will fuel imports, expected to
  increase by 8.6 pct against an originally estimated 7.1 pct.
      Export growth has been revised downwards to 3.7 pct from
  5.2 pct due to the peseta's continuing strength against the
  dollar and slack external demand.
      Slow growth of exports and a tight rein on state spending
  has lowered estimated GDP growth to three pct in 1987 from an
  earlier forecast 3.5 pct. GDP grew by three pct last year.
      The economy ministry is holding its inflation forecast to
  five pct, in spite of minister Carlos Solchaga's doubts last
  week on whether this target could be maintained if wage
  settlements continue to rise above the government's recommended
  five pct ceiling.
      Unions and employers dispute the average wage increases

  French sugar producer Beghin-Say is not
  currently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed into
  intervention, despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded at
  this week's European Community (EC) sugar tender, Beghin-Say
  President Jean-Marc Vernes told Reuters.
      The maximum rebate of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos on
  Wednesday was the largest ever granted, according to traders.
      Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission has
  started to move in the right direction, but said his company
  had no plans to change its decision to put sugar into
  intervention.
      But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a final
  agreement would be reached with the commission which would
  allow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention.
      European operators offered 854,000 tonnes of sugar into
  intervention to protest about export rebates which they say are
  too low. Over 785,000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by the
  commission on Wednesday, according to commission sources.
      Under EC regulations, however, operators have another four
  to five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention before
  payment is made for it.
      A total of 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnes
  of West German sugar has been accepted into intervention, trade
  sources said here. This amount represents about a third of
  annual EC exports to non-EC countries.
      Beghin-Say declined to specify the amount of sugar it had
  offered into intervention, but said it was below 500,000
  tonnes.
      Producers say they have been losing 2.5 to 3.0 Ecus on
  every 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fully
  bridge the gap between EC and world prices. Wednesday's rebate
  was 0.87 Ecus short of what producers say is needed to get an
  equivalent price to that for sales into intervention, traders
  said.
      Vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates to
  the full intervention price and said Wednesday's tender was a
  step in the right direction.
      Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorised
  for export since the begining of the current campaign had been
  inadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate.
      Trade sources said new regulations governing export
  rebates, which are due to be adopted shortly, may smooth the
  path for the commission to award larger export rebates in
  future.
      One source at a leading French sugar house said it seemed
  the commission had understood the protest action and was now
  moving towards adapting the situation accordingly, thereby
  allowing the operators to withdraw their sugar from
  intervention once they got satisfaction.

  Japan should increase foreign access to
  its farm products market, while encouraging further development

      The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31
  said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at
  the next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
  talks will help prepare Japan to improve access.
      Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked an
  easing in Japan's tough position on agricultural imports which
  stressed the need for strict controls on some products to
  maintain self-sufficiency in food.
      Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs,
  down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show.
      The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to
  improve productivity and demand/supply imbalances.
      The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly
  responsible for higher domestic prices, it said.
      The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but
  has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has
  worsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the paper
  said.
      This could make it difficult to improve the industry's
  structure, the paper said.
      To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices

  Amid new concerns about inflation,
  interest rate increases and trade confrontations,
  finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss
  a deteriorating global debt and economic situation.
      The meetings, under the auspices of the International
  Monetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates are
  turning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further,
  upsetting bond and stock markets.
      Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global
  economy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continue
  to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new
  assistance.
      Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs
  any new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury Secretary
  James Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works.
      The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil,
  which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs of
  commercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded by
  laying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans.
      Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in a
  visit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out the
  administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to
  the very poorest states.
      The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers
  in detail during next week's meetings and will undoubtedly be
  embraced by the developing countries.
      ""There's interest on the part of some countries for looking
  at the support of the special problems of the very poorest
  countries, because their position is so extreme,"" a Reagan
  administration official said.
      He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue.
      The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debt
  initiative, which called for new funding to help debtor
  countries grow out of their problems.
      The largest industrial countries have been attempting to
  coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the
  decline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and other
  problems.
      At the same time, the industrial countries see little
  evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fund
  forecasts they will grow 2.5 pct.
      The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself, 
  continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked other
  industrial countries to stimulate their economies.
      These issues directly affect the debt problem and the
  ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their
  difficulties.
      In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports of
  developing country, allowing them to earn critical foreign
  exchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit,
  running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing others
  to import more from developing countries.
      The discussions, from April six to 10, will be
  wide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to the
  impact of development loans on the environment, according to
  monetary sources.
      The talks will include an examination of trade
  protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reagan
  administration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on
  microchip products from Japan, the sources said.
      The move accelerated the dollar's decline as financial
  markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing.
      There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. charges
  that Japan has been selling computer chip products below fair
  market value and has kept its own market closed to imports,
  further undermining the international trading system.
      At the same time, the ministers will discuss the
  fundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the export
  mainstay of many developing countries.
      The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- the
  United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- will
  gather for the first time since their February talks in Paris,
  where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further.
      The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada for
  further debate on economic policy coordination.
      As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such as
  Japan agreed to stimulate their economies, while America
  said it would reduce its federal budget deficit.
      Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to to
  have a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-American
  Development Bank, strengthening the link between loans and
  economic policy changes in debtor nations.
      Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take more
  account of the environment when making loan for dams and other
  projects.
      The new head of the Bank, Barber Conable, has said this
  issue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganization
  plan for the Bank, now being prepared.

  The Bundesbank's gross currency
  reserves rose 300 mln marks in the last week of March to 104.9
  billion marks, the Bundesbank said in a statement.
      At the same time its foreign liabilities rose 100 mln to
  22.8 billion, producing a rise in net reserves of 200 mln to
  82.2 billion on March 31.
      The Bundesbank provided banks with liquidity in the fourth
  March week by disbursing funds in the money market via
  government-owned banks. Banks took up the Bundesbank's standing
  offer of treasury bills to place excess liquidity.
      Banks received more liquidity through routine month-end
  payments by public authorities as well as expansionary market
  factors than was lost through the 2.3 billion mark rise in cash

  Pakistan is not emerging as a major
  wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough,
  Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the
  Pakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview.
      No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and
  plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing
  because they could not agree a price, he said.
      Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses
  of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few
  harvests in years when the weather is favourable.
      The government does not wish to increase output much above
  this because of low world prices, and the land would be better
  used for other crops.
      Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown
  to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some
  10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to
  more profitable crops such as oilseeds.
      The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the
  current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha
  over the next five to seven years, he said.
      Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is
  just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln
  tonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year's
  yield of 14.0 mln.
      He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more
  recent rains reduced prospects slightly.
      The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln
  tonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan's annual
  population growth rate of more than three pct. Current
  consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes.
      The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said.
  This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln
  tonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a
  ""strategic reserve"" target of two mln tonnes.
      Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over
  target, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said.
      The government wants to keep an extra ""safety margin"" until
  it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat
  rationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exports
  will be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88
  crop can be gauged as well, he said.
      The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for the
  government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two
  rupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price in
  Pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo.
      Under the old system, introduced during World War Two and
  due to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards were
  issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply.
      Aziz said following the introduction of a government
  support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that
  only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the
  consumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills.
      The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect
  on the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said.
      Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of
  the new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensive
  Pakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March
  1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30.
      Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a
  major effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better
  use of side-products such as bran.

  The European Commission's decision to
  release an additional 300,000 tonnes of British intervention
  feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate
  relief in an increasingly tight market, traders said.
      Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage,
  pointing out that at this week's U.K. Intervention tender the
  market sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonnes
  were granted.
      The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to
  satisfy demand, they said, and keen buying competition for
  supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm.
      The release of the feed wheat followed recent strong
  representations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission.
  There has been growing concern that rising internal prices,
  triggered by heavy exports, were creating areas of shortage in
  interior markets.
      The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at the
  April 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month.
  The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May and
  June.
      News of the release produced an early downward reaction in
  local physical markets, but by midday some sections had halved
  early two stg losses while others were unchanged.
      Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mln
  tonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in the
  free market. However, some traders believe these figures are
  overstated and, while some may still be held on the farm, the
  bulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also off
  the market in futures stores.
      A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been
  sold for export or to the home market since the season started
  July 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59
  mln tonnes.
      Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mln
  tonnes, leaving about 753,000 tonnes, traders said.
      This season's U.K. Export performance has surpassed all
  early expectations and has created the present nervous
  situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market
  supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in
  August.
      The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total
  barley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes, a new
  record and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnes
  achieved in the 1984/85 season.
      Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln and
  barley around 4.50 mln tonnes.
      The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mln
  tonnes of British wheat and barley this season, but only 1.28
  mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25, traders
  said.
      Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British
  grain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mln
  tonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley. This compares
  with 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season.
      The market is expecting prices, particularly wheat, to stay
  buoyant for the remaining few months of the season. If supplies
  become more difficult and prices strengthen further, feed
  compounders may increase cereal substitute usage, traders said.

  Portugal's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
  will grow around four pct this year, the same rate as in 1986,
  according to a Bank of Portugal forecast.
      Total investment this year, the country's second as a
  member of the European Community (EC), will rise nearly 10 pct,
  again the same rate as last year, the central bank study said.
      It added that Portugal's current account was forecast to
  show a surplus of 400 mln dlrs this year compared with 1.13
  billion in 1986 and 369 mln the previous year.
      Last year's high surplus was attributed to cheaper oil and
  raw materials, lower world interest rates and a weaker dollar.
      Imports by volume were forecast to grow 10 pct this year
  and exports four pct compared with increases of 16.5 pct and
  6.6 pct respectively in 1986, the bank said.
      The forecasts were calculated on the assumption that the
  non-expansionary monetary policy carried out by the current
  government would be maintained, particularly in budget spending
  and income and in wage policy.
      The bank added that the 1987 forecasts were also based on
  the assumption that the international economic situation and
  Portugal's world trade relations would remain more or less the
  same as in 1986.
      The central bank said the high rate of investment estimated
  for 1986 was due to government policies and to increasing
  optimism among firms whose financial situation had improved
  since 1985. This tendency was expected to continue this year,
  especially in the construction and public works sectors.
      Financial aid from the EC had also helped to boost
  investment last year, the bank said.

  Soviet winter grains could be off to
  a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall
  and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said.
      Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the
  Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to
  forecast any major crop problems, analysts said.
      But the situation bears careful watching over the next six
  weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and
  future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said.
      ""From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that
  the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a
  lower crop (than last year),"" Gail Martell, chief meteorologist
  for E.F. Hutton said.
      The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will
  be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of
  the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.
      ""Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of
  us,"" an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.
      The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares
  of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.
  This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop
  and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the
  USDA analyst said.
      With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able
  to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts
  noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops
  -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.
      Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover
  combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however,
  snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,
  so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been
  due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.
      ""Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation
  between mediocre crops and fall dryness,"" Martell said.
      Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal
  in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the
  entire winter crop area, she said.
      Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the
  snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused 
  problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior
  forecaster for Accu Weather, said.
      Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the
  fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures,
  the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would
  require longer off-pasture feeding, they said.
      ""The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they
  don't have to buy (grains) now,"" a USDA official said.
      But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and
  if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a
  one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet
  buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.
      Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the
  Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said.
      ""A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and
  a half,"" Martell said.

  World Bank President Barber Conable
  expressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of a
  new showdown between the United States and Japan, might spread
  throughout the industrial world.
      But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the action
  by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic
  goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a
  full-scale trade war.
      Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing
  countries to open their markets, arguing that a free trading
  environment increased the possibility of global economic
  growth.
      ""We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to many
  countries in the developing world which have encouraged the
  opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the
  developed world doesn't close at the same time,"" he said.
      He said the U.S. action against Japan was ""a significant
  retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in
  trade policy.""
      The interview came just before next week's semi-annual
  meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
      Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium,
  Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious
  and must be closely watched.
      He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated on
  making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the
  developing world such as dams, roads and sewers, will
  increasingly make assistance available for economic reform.
      The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of the
  debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new
  funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms
  aimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investment
  and reducing government's role in the economy.
      ""We're comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect,
  however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio,""
  Conable said.
      He made clear, however, that adjustment lending would
  continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending
  for some time.
      He noted, ""the problem of debt was a severe one and many
  countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the
  problem of debt.""
      Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New York
  chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He
  is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched
  the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October,
  1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by
  the World Bank.
      Conable also said that he expected the result of a major
  study of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next
  several weeks.
      He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in
  part, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the
  poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the
  richest countries because of inefficiency.
      the reorganization is considered a major initiative by
  Conable, and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151
  member-countries as an indication of his management style and
  priorities.
      ""I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who
  must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be
  permitted to grow,"" Conable said.
      However, he said ""I don't believe there is anything
  basically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it
  has to have any redefinition of its purpose.""
      He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt
  initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role
  in dealing with the debt crisis.
      Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its
  sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and
  that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel
  Camdessus on a variety of issues.
      On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need
  to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that ""I don't have
  a particular mission here except to be useful to the
  institution and to the process of development.""
      He added, ""so I don't feel a great calling to personalize
  the institution.""
      On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said
  that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting
  the region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing
  of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development
  Association was earmarked for Africa.
      Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new
  forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those

  Crude oil prices rallied today, moving
  over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined
  effort to support prices, analysts said.
      ""The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market,
  hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without
  another meeting,"" said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with
  Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
      ""But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to
  seasonal declines in demand and some cheating,"" he added.
      Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt
  to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from
  the official prices agreed to last december.
      The analysts said that to get others to hold the line,
  Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers
  of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the
  Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week.
      The Saudis have also offered to support members having
  difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.
      ""They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to
  prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC
  member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members
  that lose sales,"" Margoshes said.
      He added that the allocations would probably be in the form
  of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.
      Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line
  nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it
  is also likely that such assistance would be provided to
  Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.
      Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC
  president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC
  meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the
  December pact is falling apart.
      Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham
  Harris and Co said, ""both physical and futures markets have been
  oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short
  covering rally.""
      He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which
  refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners
  into the market to cover their short positions.
      Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market
  to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast
  sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading
  yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the
  North sea crude oil market.
      Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today
  that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent
  for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels
  being fixed to make such shipments.
      North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades
  reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.
      OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their
  quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.
      Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC
  production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last
  december but he gave no details on OPEC production against
  claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.
      ""The production probably is about their quota level and
  largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell
  its oil as a result,"" Margoshes said.
      Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the
  current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if
  Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.
      But others said that despite the rally today there were
  still several fundamental factors, including demand, which
  could cut the rally short.
      Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said
  slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep
  demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise
  about 1.4 pct over 1986.

  U.S. scientists said some tropical
  vegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is at
  risk because of high levels of saturated fat, lending weight to
  a campaign by the American Soybean Association (ASA) for
  labelling changes.
      The scientists appeared to support an ASA charge, denied by
  Malaysian palm growers, that imported coconut, palm and palm
  kernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raise
  blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.
      In a petition filed in January, the ASA asked the U.S. Food
  and Drug Administration (FDA) to require palm, palm kernel and
  coconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on food
  manufacturers' labels.
      The FDA responded to the ASA in a letter saying it would
  consider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealing
  with cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods.
      Malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the ASA
  that palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol and
  contributes to heart disease are untrue.
      But Steve Chang, Professor of Food Science at Rutgers
  University, said, ""Palm oil is definitely not good for human
  health because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid.""
      He added that the higher the fatty acid, the greater the
  blood cholesterol level. ""It has been well established that
  high cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heart
  disease,"" he said.
      A Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Council official, Borge
  Bek-Nielsen, has said studies have shown that palm oil is
  cholesterol-free, low in saturated fats, has anti-cancer
  properties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteries
  in humans.
      Bek-Nielsen said Americans consume more saturated fats
  daily through food like butter, bacon, ham and beef than from
  palm oil, which, he added is rich in vitamins A and E.
      David Kritchevsky, Associate Director of the Wistar
  Institute in Philadelphia, appeared to take the ASA view on
  labelling. ""What people really have to learn is to read labels,""
  said Kritchevsky. ""The more a consumer knows, the more likely he
  will make an intelligent choice.""
      The U.S. scientists said they had no doubt imported palm,
  palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels.
      Kritchevsky, a specialist in nutrition, said, ""More
  saturated fat would raise cholesterol levels...So, from that
  point of view it's a health risk. High cholesterol levels in
  the blood are a risk factor for heart disease.""
      Susanne Harris, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S.
  Agriculture Department's Food and Consumer Services Division,
  said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils with
  high saturated fat levels was highest among those who have
  heart disease.
      The scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acid
  content of the tropical oils was saturated, whereas less than
  20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated.
      David Ericksen, director of ASA's technical services, said
  U.S. soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273
  mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumers
  were aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat.
      Imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of U.S.
  soybean sales in the U.S. market, ASA estimates.
      U.S. imports of coconut oil during January totaled 82.9 mln
  lbs compared with 48.0 mln lbs in December and 106.5 mln a year
  earlier, according to Commerce Department figures.
      Imports of palm oil totaled 44.0 mln lbs compared with 51.3
  mln lbs in December and 85.2 mln a year earlier.

  Firmer crude oil prices, government aid
  packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oil
  industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry
  analysts said.
      They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987
  compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices dropped
  about 50 pct.
      On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to
  their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at
  record highs.
      ""This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the
  part of the investment community that the outlook for the
  industry for the future is extremely attractive,"" Peters and Co
  Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said.
      Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies,
  culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr
  1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last
  year's results, analysts said.
      ""But the financial statements are a snap shot and a
  recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the
  future,"" Gobert commented.
      The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41
  companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15
  at the end of 1986.
      Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares of
  Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, is
  trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4.
      Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
  is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4.
  Texaco Canada Inc &lt;TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, is
  at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2.
      Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts
  operating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gas
  companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs
  and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion
  dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S.
  dlrs a barrel. ""However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a
  barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase
  with cash flow 27 pct higher,"" analyst Plexman said.
      ""Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the
  profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,""
  he added.
      Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when
  operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05
  billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90
  billion dlrs.
      But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will hold
  recent gains and more government assistance is needed.
      Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans
  Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987,
  after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude
  oil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC
  production accord will continue to support prices.
      However, several companies share the optimistic industry
  outlook expressed by a majority of analysts.
      Shell Canada and &lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast
  improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this
  week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels.
      ""The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not
  robust,"" Texaco Canada said in its annual report.
      ""While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is
  good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable,
  continued volatility is likely,"" Texaco Canada added.
      In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have
  pared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels,
  deferring most frontier exploration work.
      ""The industry is becoming very selective in investments,
  very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,""
  Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said.
      Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion
  the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results.
      The most significant help came last September when the
  federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax
  (PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned.
      Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil
  companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.
      The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow
  decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further
  exploration spending cuts, analysts said.
      ""For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely
  necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that
  were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably
  more,"" Maciej said.

  Coffee prices may have to fall even lower
  to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the
  negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and
  traders said.
      The failure last night of International Coffee
  Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree
  export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee
  futures markets today with the London May price reaching a
  4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before
  ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous
  close.
      The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb.
      Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the
  ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope
  the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor
  under prices, some senior traders said.
      The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for
  March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents
  a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in
  February last year following a sharp rise in international
  prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.
      In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,
  President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said
  they need to make hard commercial decisions. ""If we have failed
  at the ICO, at least we have tried,"" Dauster said, adding ""now it
  is time to go and sell coffee.""
      But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans
  to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next
  month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade
  sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a
  previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public
  selling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market
  last year.
      A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the
  market ""in one go"" but is sold over a minimum of six months.
      The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split
  between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for
  future quotas. Consumers said ""objective criteria"" like average
  exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,
  Dauster said.
      All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but
  consumers insisted they did not want a return to the ""ad hoc"" way
  of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst
  producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.
      Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and
  non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and
  that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set
  ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.
      It is a ""simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate""
  policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome
  to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very
  difficult to allocate as different ""objective criteria"" achieve
  different share-outs of quota, Dauster said.
      Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO
  and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.
      Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to
  accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves
  impossible to find an acceptable basis for them.
      ""We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to
  encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if
  supplies are needed at a later stage,"" one delegate said.
      Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer
  argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO
  session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse
  and how much producers will sink their differences should
  prices fall further and remain depressed.
      The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but
  both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real
  negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in
  Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.
      More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and
  politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could
  bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than
  many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during
  the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before
  October are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has
  continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.
      A clear difference between the pressures already being felt
  by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been
  happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could
  not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could
  show a direct relationship between quotas and availability.
      In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the
  seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to
  lapse should lasting agreement not be found.
      ""Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their
  failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient
  and we wanted a cast iron commitment now,"" one consumer said.

  Rising demand for U.S. rice may
  gradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should help
  increase the U.S. share of the world rice market despite
  sluggish trade this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary, the
  department said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the
  1986/87 marketing year, causing stocks to fall about 10 mln
  hundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt on
  July 31.
      Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage is
  expected to decline this year, the report said.
      USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grain
  acreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grain
  relative to long grain have increased, the loan differential
  has been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yields
  relative to those of other classes have leveled off.
      With the drop in domestic prices resulting from the
  marketing loan, domestic rice use is expected to grow at a
  faster rate, USDA said.
      ""Development of new products and increased promotion have
  helped make rice more available and visible to a wider range of
  consumers,"" USDA said.
      USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 because
  of large production and stocks but a weaker market should
  affect competing exporters more than the U.S.
      ""The United States has already recovered a substantial share
  of the European Community market and made inroads into markets
  in the Middle East and Africa,"" the report said.
      World rice consumption is projected to reach record levels
  in 1986/87, the report said, as higher per capita incomes,
  increased domestic production and low import prices have
  allowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarse
  grains.
      China, India and South Korea have increased output, while
  the Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since the
  mid-1970s, the report said.

  Four U.S. meat processors have asked
  the federal government to relax a labelling requirement which
  they said discourages the use of mechanically separated meat,
  the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co,
  Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allow
  mechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels as
  the species from which it was derived.
      For example, ""pork"" would be listed on the ingredients
  statement instead of ""mechanically separated pork.""
      Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat product
  would have to be stated on the label and the mechanically
  separated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meat
  and poultry portion of the product.
      Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-cost
  product that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said.
      Current regulations allow use of mechanically separated
  ingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultry
  product, but require it to be listed in the ingredient
  statement as ""mechanically separated (species),"" USDA said.
      USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoid
  using mechanically separated meat in their products because the
  term carries an ""unwarranted negative connotation"" in the minds
  of many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similar
  regulation exists for poultry products.
      Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcass
  parts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have some
  remaining meat, into specialized processing equipment.

  Growth in oil consumption in the Western
  industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct
  this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International
  Energy Agency (IEA) said.
      Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around
  one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in
  its Monthly Oil Market Report.
      Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from
  transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are
  higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be
  below last year's 3.6 pct, it said.
      The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices
  stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can
  be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some
  of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there
  may be slightly less growth in transport fuels.
      IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at
  428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption.
  This is about the same level as at the begining of the year.
      The agency said this flat trend is explained by the
  projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of
  the year which offset a reduction in stocks.
      It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell
  by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the
  year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but
  a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.
      It is possible that final data will show a larger draw,
  particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell,
  there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported
  stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.
      Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
  on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built
  up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the
  period.
      The year-on-year trend of government stock building is
  continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more
  or less in line with consumption, after declining for five
  years, the IEA noted.
      Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6
  mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January
  1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption,
  respectively.
      Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April
  1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to
  94 days of consumption.
      World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln
  bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.
      This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
  production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5
  mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from
  centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.
      Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first
  quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd
  of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average
  for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled
  28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.
      A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast
  3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the
  largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA
  said.
      Saudi Arabia""s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd.

  The U.S. economy in March improved at a
  faster rate than in February, with the National Association of
  Purchasing Management's composite index rising to 53.9 pct from
  51.9 pct, the NAPM said.
      The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct.
  The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for the
  rest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross national
  product growth of about three pct.
      An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the
  economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a
  declining economy.
      The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in all
  of the indicators in the index except inventories, which
  declined slightly.
      New orders rose sharply in March, with production also
  higher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economy
  improved in March. Employment expanded for the first time since
  August 1984.
      Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey
  committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes
  Inc &lt;PBI> said ""the economy ended the first quarter with a
  healthy, if not substantial improvement.""
      Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders in
  March assures a good beginning for the second quarter.
      Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that they
  were paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Of
  those paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at
  2.5 pct.
      The estimated average price increase anticipated by members
  for the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue to
  rise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them as
  being significant.
      The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based
  on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,
  production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.
      The monthly report is based on questions asked of
  purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies.

      Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
  on April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender
  1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to
  102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986.
      The year-on-year trend of government stock building is
  continuing with company stocks rising, more or less in line
  with consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said.
      Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put
  at 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one
  and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.
      Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down
  from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to
  94 days of consumption.
      The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company
  stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first
  quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of
  400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in
  March.
      And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw,
  particulary for March, it said.
      As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also
  been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the
  IEA said.
      World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about
  two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986.
      This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
  production to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd
  in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally

  Philippine coffee exports are expected
  to fall sharply due to a combination of the International
  Coffee Organisation's (ICO) decision not to revive export
  quotas and higher local prices, ICO Certifying Agency official
  Dante de Guzman told Reuters.
      He said exporter registrations dropped from an average
  weekly 500 tonnes in March to 45 tonnes last week, with exports
  in coffee year 1986/87, ending September, forecast to total
  about 8,000 tonnes against 48,000 in 1985/86.
       ""Because of the relatively higher level of domestic prices,
  it has become difficult to service exports,"" de Guzman said,
  adding that most exporters are taking a wait and see attitude.
      Coffee production was expected to drop slightly to about
  one mln bags of 60 kg each in the 1986/87 crop year ending June
  from 1.1 mln bags last year, he said.

  Leading cocoa producers will discuss
  whether newly-agreed rules on an international cocoa buffer
  stock will succeed in reversing a sharp fall in world prices
  when they start four day's of talks here later today,
  conference sources said.
      Another topic likely to be discussed at the twice-yearly
  meeting of the Cocoa Producer Alliance (CPA) is the pact's
  second line of market support -- a witholding scheme under
  which exporters can take up to 120,000 tonnes of cocoa off the
  market if buffer stock purchases fail to defend prices.
      The International Cocoa Organisation is due to discuss the
  scheme at a meeting in June, and exporters could use the
  Yaounde talks to work out a common position on the issue, the
  sources said.
      Delegates will also be briefed on arrangements for an
  international cocoa research conference due to take place in
  Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic next month, CPA
  secretary general D.S. Kamga said.
      The 11-member CPA include the world's top three producers
  of Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana and accounts for around 80 pct

  The International Cocoa Organization
  (ICCO) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the
  downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying
  operations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said.
      Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could
  reach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices
  significantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging
  the market. The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the
  ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 Special
  Drawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 ""must buy"" level.
      Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last
  month by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the buffer
  stock manager has completed preparations, traders said.
      Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer
  stock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used
  to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average
  above the 1,600 SDR ""must buy"" level.
      The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of
  the second, third and fourth positions on the London and New
  York futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR per
  tonne yesterday.
      Months used currently for the indicator are May, July and
  September, but these are set to change to July, September and
  December on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spot
  month, traders noted.
      The introduction of December into the calculations may lift
  the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75
  stg above May on the London terminal market.
      But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the
  higher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, the
  indicator which governs his activities, traders said.
      ""The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the
  implications of delaying until forward prices lift the
  indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa,"" an
  analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said.
      Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000
  tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reach
  this level within six months, buying is suspended pending an
  ICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa market
  watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent
  forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln
  to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to
  three mln.
      A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87
  world surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, compared
  with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of
  94,000 tonnes, traders said.
      In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need to
  buy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the
  ""must buy"" level.
      But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put
  constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock
  manager can remove cocoa from the market.
      The buffer stock system of price differentials set
  according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from
  non-members could limit the buffer stock's scope for action,
  dealers said.
      Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is
  nearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin.
      But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as
  Malaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoa
  can only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the buffer
  stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material.
      Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member
  cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are
  pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said.
      Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from
  quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact
  on futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums for
  this cocoa over futures.
      Ghana's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg
  from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer
  stock buying, dealers said.
      ""The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but will
  provide a backstop for quality cocoas,"" one trader said.
      Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer
  stock were ""all prognostication"" and that no one could hope to
  predict accurately what the result would be. Psychologically
  buffer stock buying should help prices, but since the buffer
  stock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the
  previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealers
  expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure.
      In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding
  scheme as an additional market support mechanism.

  A study on grain certificates due out
  shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show
  that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than
  cash outlays, administration and industry sources said.
      Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture
  Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests
  that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official
  told Reuters.
      GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific
  request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the
  senate agriculture committee.
      The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates
  compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March.
      The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on
  the program's impact on the USDA loan program.
      If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan
  entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of
  the program would go up. However, if it is determined that
  certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to
  decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.
      GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates
  program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.
      But a negative report on certificates ""will fuel the fire

  Tadashi Kuranari said that British exports to Japan are
  increasing, but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade.
      Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications
  dispute, including Cable and Wireless, to be satisfied.
      Howard told reporters that Britain was actively considering
  possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the
  telecommunications issue.
      ""There are measures which are under consideration if we
  continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations,""
  he added, but gave no details.
      He said he had received a reassuring response from the
  Japanese he has spoken with.
      ""But of course we've had reassuring signs from the Japanese
  for quite some time,"" he added. ""What I've made plain is we
  expect to see action.""
      Howard ruled out using powers in Britain's Financial
  Services bill to retaliate against unfair trade practices.
  Those powers, which allow London to ban foreign financial firms
  like banks from Britain, are designed to ensure U.K. Firms
  equal access to overseas financial markets.

  Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S.
  corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in
  deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates
  and 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and
  sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs.
      Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to
  the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman
  budget deficit control act of 1985, it said.
      Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency
  payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225
  mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said.
      The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents
  per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were
  received by producers requesting advance payments.
      Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference
  between an established target price and the higher of the basic
  loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers
  during the first five months of the marketing year --
  September-January.
      National weighted average market prices for the first five
  months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and
  1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will
  be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the
  3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate.
      Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents
  per bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per
  bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan
  rate.
      The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the
  maximum permitted by law, the department said.
      Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another
  1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average
  market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing
  year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the
  department said.
      The payments will be issued through local Agricultural
  Stabilization and Conservation Service offices, it said.

  Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil
  production is likely to drop sharply this year, due to lower
  yields, the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.
      The publication expects total Malaysian output during
  Jan/Sept 1987 to decline by eight pct to 3.05 mln tonnes. For
  East Malaysia, it put production during the period at 297,000
  tonnes after 312,000 a year earlier and for West Malaysia 2.75
  mln compared with just over 3.0 mln during Jan/Sept 1986.
      It said new plantings had slowed markedly in both
  countries, but the effects of this will not be felt until
  1988-90.
      Above normal yields during recent years resulted in trees
  reacting to the stress by changing the sex ratio to more male
  inflorescences and/or aborting more female, Oil World said.
      Yields per hectare are also likely to be adversely affected
  this year by insufficient rain up to 25 months ago. This could
  especially affect trees in West Malaysia during April/June,
  while in East Malaysia the impact will be in February/April and
  July/Dec, and in Indonesia July/Sept.
      Last year's cut in fertilizer use will hit this year's
  yields and bigger effects are expected within the next three
  years, Oil World said without elaborating.
      Opening stocks in West Malaysia at the start of this year
  were put at only 565,000 tonnes compared with 914,000 in
  January 1986, Oil World said.
      West Malaysian net exports are therefore expected to drop
  500,000 tonnes to 2.54 mln during Jan/Sept, while those of East
  Malaysia are likely to decline by 10 pct to 280,000 tonnes.
      Indonesian palm oil production is forecast to fall about
  eight pct during Jan/May, but to rise from June on. Overall
  Indonesian output during Jan/Sept is forecast to rise three pct
  to 933,000 tonnes. Indonesian stocks as of April 1, however,
  are put at only 65,000 tonnes compared with 160,000 a year ago.
      Indonesian export commitments and domestic requirements are
  both running at high levels, Oil World said, and it expects the
  country's imports to reach a record 110,000 tonnes during
  Jan/Sept. The bulk of this will arrive during Feb/May, ahead of
  the April elections and the religious Ramadan festival
  throughout May, it said.
      Indonesian net exports, therefore, may fall by 29 pct to
  350,000 tonnes, Oil World said. The possibility that recent
  Indonesian palm oil purchases will not actually enter the
  country but be transshipped to other countries to fulfill
  Indonesia's export orders cannot be ruled out, it said.

  The Australian Government will likely
  reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.)
  dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S.
  Agriculture Department said.
      In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the
  department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has
  reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels
  insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at
  around 98 dlrs per tonne.
       For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5
  mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the
  breakeven export price, it said.
      Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance
  payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated
  at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current
  year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the
  department said.
      In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and
  storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.
      But the department said the Australian Bureau of
  Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will
  drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in
  1989/90.
      The decline will result from low world grain prices leading
  to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S.
  wheat exports, the department said.

  Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuring
  other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
  Countries to stay within their production quotas, said Morgan
  Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer.
      Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oil
  engineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations to
  attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years
  to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong.
      ""Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concerted
  effort by the Saudis to get production down,"" Wellemeyer said.
      ""The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a
  barrel) and are willing to make it happen again,"" he said.
      In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a
  barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing
  above their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln
  barrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S.
  crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a
  belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output.
      Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production
  could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as
  early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993.
      Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil
  should strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the
  organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a
  barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from
  switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market
  accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the
  world demand for oil.

      Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Volcker
  said that Europe and Japan were slowing exports and that growth
  in those countries was also decreasing.
      ""In that kind of situation, further sizeable depreciation
  of the dollar could well be counterproductive,"" he said.
      Domestic expansion in foreign industrial countries has not

      On the value of the dollar, Volcker said he could not say
  whether it should be higher or lower to restore balance in

      ""What we do know is that a substantial exchange rate
  adjustment has already been made,"" he said.
      ""That adjustment should be large enough, in a context of a

  while import growth should slow.

      It would also have to achieve a better balance between
  investment and domestic savings if it wants to be able to

  The United States has appealed for

      The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith
  at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows
  a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by
  the 93-nation body to promote fair trade.
      Today's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round
  launched by ministers last September. The round, which covers
  13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods and
  services will take four years to negotiate.
      Smith called for boosting GATT's links with financial
  institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World
  Bank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to
  ensure the success of the Uruguay Round.
      ""The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to
  assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the
  world trading system and the global economy,"" Smith said.
      ""Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak,
  or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy.""
      He also also urged that member states be accountable to
  each other for their trade policies.
      Smith, who flies to Brussels today for talks with European
  Community (EC) officials, told Reuters the committee wanted to
  stress GATT's importance and did not discuss specifics.
      ""We are interested in more periodic ministerial
  involvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings,"" he said.
      GATT's ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the
  12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord on
  semiconductors. The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade
  rules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese
  chips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute
  panel be set up to review the agreement.
      President Reagan, who strongly supported the Uruguay trade
  round to promote freer trade, has said Washington will impose

      The Bundesbank confirmed the German trade surplus widened
  to 10.45 billion marks in February from January's 7.20 billion.
      Taking the two months together the seasonally adjusted
  surplus was slightly below the figure for the previous two. In
  terms of current as well as constant prices, the narrowing of
  the surplus was progressing, the bank said.
      Germany's current account surplus widened to 6.63 billion
  marks in February from 4.79 billion in January, but was down on
  the 7.26 billion figure for February 1986. Seasonally adjusted,
  the February current account surplus narrowed against January.
      While exports in February fell a half pct against the same
  month last year, imports fell 10-1/2 pct largely due to the
  drop in prices. Exports grew three pct in volume and imports
  two pct.
      In the balance of services, a fall in net investment income
  led to a 300 mln mark deficit in February after a 300 mln mark
  surplus in January.
      The deficit in transfer payments widened to 3.70 billion
  marks from 2.69 billion, largely due to a sharp jump to 2.3
  billion marks from 200 mln in payments to the European
  Community budget.

  Japan is attempting to cut back
  semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S.
  tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April
  17, industry analysts said.
      The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a
  possible shortage of the key computer components in the next
  few weeks, the analysts said.
      ""Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay of
  the Japanese semiconductor industry,"" analyst Drew Peck of
  Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said.
      But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far,
  and some questioned whether Japan would be successful in
  forcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run.
      Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence was
  already in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted
  sales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sell
  chips at below production costs.
      ""We've seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS, and
  it has virtually dried up for EPROMS,"" said Merrill Lynch
  analyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in
  computers.
      ""Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are
  stretching,"" Kurlack added.
      Industry analysts said Japan's Ministry of International
  Trade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs in
  production to meet the terms of last year's semiconductor
  accord with the U.S.
      The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on
  Japanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed to
  live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer
  components in the U.S. market.
      But some analysts said Japan's attempt to mollify the U.S.
  was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form of
  trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S.
      As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, prices
  will rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductor
  manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long
  ago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makers
  that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured.
      ""The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade
  pressures from Washington, but at the same time they're
  demonstating their muscle,"" analyst Peck said.
      The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to
  benefit U.S. chip makers.
      ""I think this could be a very important factor for U.S.
  semiconductor manufacturers,"" industry analyst Elliot Levine of
  Ladenburg Thalmann Co said.
      But analyst Peck said, ""it will take a few weeks to see
  whether Japan has genuinely cut production.""
      He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI's
  request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and
  production cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in
  plant and equipment.

  Kuwait has asked at least four

  Reagan Administration officials said.
      The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait
  wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Soviet
  registration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new
  ""Silkworm"" missiles at superpower flags.
      The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to

      The official said both surplus countries, like West Germany

      He reaffirmed the U.S. would press ahead with efforts to

  OPEC may be forced to meet before a
  scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting
  agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide
  in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.
      ""The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy
  as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out
  the problems,"" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy
  Research Associates, CERA.
      Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC
  faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.
      ""OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production
  issue and must be addressed in that way,"" said Paul Mlotok, oil
  analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
      He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its
  ability to keep production under control have given way to a
  pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if
  it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.
      But some other analysts were uncertain that even an
  emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production
  above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.
      ""OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have
  deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,"" said the

      David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC
  to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is
  not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.
      ""They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the
  winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April
  when demand slackens,"" Mizrahi said.
      But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more
  than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.""
      Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for
  OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.

  Petroleum futures rallied today in a
  market that was expecting declines in domestic supplies and
  became further unsettled by escalated Mideast fighting.
      Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on the
  New York Mercantile Exchange, with crude oil prices matching
  life-of-contract highs. Crude for delivery in May closed 17
  cents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel.
      ""Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will
  not remain there long if products are not strong,"" Robert
  Murphy, account executive at E.F. Hutton, said.
      Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that the
  American Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domestic
  inventories of petroleum products in a weekly report.
      Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation in
  the Iran-Iraq war, with the Iranians reportedly launching a new
  offensive against Iraqi positions, and Iraq attacking offshore
  oil fields and an oil export depot.
      Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold and
  silver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
      Gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before the
  close with support from the silver market, which was
  approaching two-year highs, traders said.
      Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of
  Trade, while corn and wheat were mostly higher.
      Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, and
  the soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, which
  is limiting supplies.
      In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projected
  a substantial drop in soybean acreage this year.     Monday's
  report that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for
  export last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lack
  of farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traders
  said.
      Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago
  Mercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower.
      Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many
  farmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather
  than marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash sales
  have been lighter than expected this week.
      The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, but
  prices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as
  speculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said.
      Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength
  related to tight supplies.
      Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gains
  past three-year peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meat
  packers to bid aggressively for available animals.
      However, some traders sold contracts to take profits after
  the extended rally, which has seen the April delivery contract
  soar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start
  of the year.
      New York coffee futures closed higher on trade talk Brazil
  would not be an aggressive seller near term, analysts said.

  A group of Canadian lawmakers from
  Ontario today asked their U.S. counterparts to exempt Canada
  from the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a major
  trade bill being considered by the U.S. Congress.
      At a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition, an
  organization of U.S. legislators, David Cooke, chairman of the
  Ontario Parliament's Select Committee on Economic Affairs, said
  the exemption would help trade relations.
      The trade legislation to be considered by the full House in
  late April would require President Reagan to retaliate against
  foreign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would
  harm the U.S. economy.
      Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on any
  grounds.
      Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S.
  congressmen, ""I can understand (the trade bill). I think it has
  to do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world.""
      ""I would suggest to you that we are your best friends. You
  do not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerely
  consider exempting our country from that bill,"" he added.
      Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, with
  two-way trade more than 113 billion dlrs in 1985, according to

  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
  said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation
  of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German
  economic growth.
      In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs
  here, Poehl said ""It would be an extremely risky policy to aim
  for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to
  correct the trade deficit.""
      He said the United States could face a vicious circle of
  depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that
  route.
      Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet
  U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,
  accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating
  above-target money supply growth.
      He said he would have been happy to have brought forward
  five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to
  the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced
  political constraints getting such measures through the upper
  house of the West German parliament.
      But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could
  accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.
      Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about
  one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial
  erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing
  demand at home.
      ""A further appreciation of the mark could even be an
  obstacle to further growth,"" he said.
      Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply
  growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and
  because external factors, including low oil prices and
  favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.
      But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma
  over monetary policy.
      The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the
  reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany
  was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.
      ""For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more
  on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary
  money supply. But we must be very careful,"" he said.
      He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's
  trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as
  the United States.
      Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary
  officials of major industrialized countries, saying the
  importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange
  rates had been underestimated.
      All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the
  right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he
  said.
      ""This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the
  part of our American colleagues,"" he said.
      But he said there was still a danger that the correction of
  the dollar's value could overshoot.

  Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta plan
  this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European
  Community levels, director-general of the INFE export
  institute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said.
      ""The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic
  Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now,"" he
  said.
       ""This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there
  is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy,
  which have a similar productive structure,"" he said.
      The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and other
  fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence in
  international trade fairs.
      Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well as
  traditional industrial exports will be promoted.
      Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20
  billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while the
  government's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special
  25 billion peseta grant.
      The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in
  real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year.
      Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in
  developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand,
  which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985.
      He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went to
  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
  countries.
      The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the
  Community rose seven pct last year. The government plans to
  concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S.
      ""The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are
  vital to survival in the context of EC competition,"" he said.
      He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the
  domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, while
  turning their backs on foreign markets.
      ""They have to realise their share of the home market is
  going to shrink with growing deregulation,"" he said. ""Foreign

  The cost of living in West Germany will
  likely be about 0.5 pct higher on average in 1987 than in 1986,
  when the cost of living actually fell by an average 0.2 pct in
  the first recurrence of ""negative inflation"" since the 1950s, the
  HWWA economic research institute said.
      The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the
  fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986
  cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the
  value of the dollar, the institute said in a report.
      The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the
  course of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a
  whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the
  first part of 1987.
      Provisional inflation figures for February released last
  week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower
  than in February 1986. In January prices had fallen 0.8 pct
  against the same month a year earlier.

  Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments
  deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking
  steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali
  Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning
  Organisation said.
      He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of
  economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985,
  which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.
      Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a
  drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury
  wholesale index last year.
      This year's target of 20 pct ""might be attainable but the
  economic management will have to be careful,"" he said.
      Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme
  which is central to the government's economic planning, said
  Turkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account
  shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.
      ""We must alleviate the current account substantially to
  sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure
  over the last five years,"" he added.
      His comment echoed last October's Organisation for Economic
  Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said
  Ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms
  would look better if inflation were lower and the current
  account deficit cut or turned into a surplus.
      ""In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector
  investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a
  percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible
  improvement in the current account deficit,"" he said.
      Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was
  also to blame for the high deficits.
      Appropriations to government departments had been cut by
  eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign
  borrowing by municipalities had been restrained.
      ""We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the
  investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations,"" he
  said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing
  requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated
  5.6 pct in 1986.
      More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also
  targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage
  exports, and production incentives were being considered.
      ""We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected
  into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion
  policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and
  local private capital come more into play as far as
  manufacturing capacity is concerned,"" Tigrel said.
      He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish
  economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under
  way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate
  policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done
  in a country where the state still dominates industry and the
  currency is only partially convertible.

  Drilling for oil in California is
  likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels
  despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts
  said.
      Because much of the crude oil in California fields is
  thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to
  increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery
  is seen in drilling, they said.
      ""Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,""
  said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.
      Few new wells now are being drilled.
      Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,
  were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared
  to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil
  Information Services, which tracks California drilling
  activity.
      ""It's in the dregs right now,"" said Bolster of the state's
  drilling activity.
      Current prices are not enough to justify increased
  drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent
  Producers Association.
      While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact
  to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices
  eventually fell.
      Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have
  slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high
  of about 17 dlrs.
      More than half of California's oil comes from stripper
  wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that
  much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to
  extract, Malmgreen said.
      ""It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,""
  Malmgreen said.
      Many stripper wells along the southern California coast
  produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland
  wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur
  extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.
      The outlook for future production in California is clouded
  by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.
      In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which
  produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory
  drilling has slowed to a crawl.
      Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in
  1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of
  the state energy commission. So far this year only five
  exploratory wells have been drilled.
      ""I don't think they'll even get to what they did last
  year,"" Mitchell said.
      No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of
  the decade, Mitchell said.
      Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the
  number of producing wells and overall production.
      Between February and October of 1986, the number of
  producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from
  more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy
  Commission.
      In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output
  fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is
  expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.
      Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil
  production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels
  per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.
      Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986
  was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405
  mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of
  Conservation.
      ""Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,""
  Guerard said.

  Texas Railroad Commissioner James
  Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for
  Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt
  incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance
  taxes on oil produced from stripper wells.
      Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of
  representatives that the state must take the initiative in
  molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist
  troubled oil producers.
      His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt
  stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day
  from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the
  majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well
  category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be
  crucial in determining if the well remains in production.
      Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new
  wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years
  as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.
      Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of
  production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover
  oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent
  said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary
  wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day
  for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a
  barrel.
      ""We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal
  administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the
  nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough,"" Nugent
  said. ""In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead,

  Liquefied natural gas imports from
  Algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its
  economically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said.
      Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian
  state petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in
  Algiers that such imports would be made this year.
      ""Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and
  the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay
  the import until 1988/1989,"" Daniel Tulis, a natural gas
  analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said.
      Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former
  customers, Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary
  of Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials
  told Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington
  Northern &lt;BNI>, has expressed no interest.
      Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were
  feasible. ""On a marginal cost basis, the companies that have
  made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate
  profitably even in the current price environment,""  Frank
  Spadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said.
     Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports
  on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend
  higher by the end of 1987.
      A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of
  Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm
  prices, Shearson's Tulis said.
     In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source of
  supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added.
      Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree,
  saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand.
      Company sources also said that any negotiations with

  Switzerland's economy, combining low
  unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments
  surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory
  future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
  Development, OECD, said.
      This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight
  fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it
  said.
      The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out
  some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in
  inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.
      The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product
  growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986
  and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after
  last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.
      But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest
  increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate
  unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial
  nation OECD area.
      Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to
  the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986,
  the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct
  rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct
  respectively in 1986.
      The faster growth of imports compared with exports this
  year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant
  that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP
  would shrink in both years.
      But ""given Switzerland's large external surplus, there
  should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than
  GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to
  improving international balances,"" the OECD said.
      Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually
  buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several
  years of relative weakness, it noted.
      In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat
  to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall
  GDP, it added.
      The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained
  bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels
  last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation
  in both the industry and service sectors, it said.
      As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment
  investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year
  after vigorous growth in 1986.
      But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for
  tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector
  earners of foreign exchange.
      The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the
  accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could
  lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.
      Particularly for the banks, ""recent developments in
  international financial markets give rise to the question
  whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial
  flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed
  required ... To preserve its competitive position,"" it said.

  A senior British official said that
  protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger
  retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the
  global trading system.
      Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if
  Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which
  would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian
  textile producers, ""the community would have to retaliate.""
      His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade
  Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the
  community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.
      Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two
  days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members
  of Congress.
      De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.
      Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in
  Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the
  Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade
  deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.
      Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to
  force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.
      Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone
  problems - its surplus with the United States last year was
  51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.
      ""The more united pressure there could be, the better,"" he
  said.
      Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to
  avoid trade disputes.
      He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation
  earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and
  Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports
  regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.
      ""But if both sides drew back from the brink that time,"" he
  said, """"it does not mean that they would do so on another
  occasion.""
      Channon added that ""There is increasing reesentment in
  Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure
  of unilaterally imposed deadlines.""
      He said other potential conflicts are already in sight -
  alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and
  taxes on fats and oils - and ""the commuity and the United States
  must therefore learn to manage their relations better.""
      He said another bill to let the United States retaliate
  against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S.
  goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on
  Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.
      He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not

  came mainly from the bank's purchases of more than one billion

  The outlook for the West
  German economy is relatively bright, with gross national
  product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel
  University's Institute for World Economy said.
      The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading
  economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic
  than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently
  reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.
      In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export
  outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's
  strength against the dollar and other major currencies.
      ""The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in
  all, limited,"" the report said. ""On the contrary, a slight rise
  in exports can be expected.""
      The institute said past experience has shown West German
  exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by
  cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting
  their product ranges.
      They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in
  economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the
  decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow
  this year.
      West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed
  advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both
  of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary
  policy, the institute said.
      However, it said the labour market would see only a slight
  improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire
  additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by
  agreed reductions in working hours.
      The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of
  monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked
  acceleration of inflation.
      It also warned that what it called the worldwide
  synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new
  global recession. It said central banks in industrialized
  countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal
  Reserve Board's expansionary course.
      The institute said this in turn was bound to lead
  eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.
  Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks
  were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could
  aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as
  increase protectionism around the world.
      Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the
  negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary
  policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of
  growth at home.
      The institute said this could be done by ensuring that
  fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes
  should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and
  wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than
  in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary
  pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply
  to about four pct.

  Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its
  economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington
  to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining
  restrictions two weeks ago.
      Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown
  of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of
  hypothetical losses. Some of them are ""too sophisticated to
  convert into financial terms,"" one banking source said.
      But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is
  impossible to calculate.
      They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's
  economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.
      ""Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-
  achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only
  contributed to largely internal, economic problems,"" one said.
      The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured
  Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation
  for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under
  martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was
  originally devised several years ago by the Institute of
  National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning
  commission.
      According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish
  economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth
  trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in
  credits from Western commercial and government lenders.
      But the calculations were based on a time when trade was
  booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing
  the estimate as ""a theoretical projection based on a high point,
  which has no real scientific evaluation.""
      A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to
  the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs
  annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were
  imposed.
      Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to
  200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade
  surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs
  against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.
      Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important
  U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,
  chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits
  dried up for economic not political reasons.  ""Poland is
  accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for
  political reasons,"" said one expert. ""It's an illusion based on a
  misunderstanding of Western economy.""
      ""There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone
  who has no hope of repaying it,"" another said, adding that
  Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits
  in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.
      Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as ""nebulous,"" one
  diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders
  and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of
  scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the
  lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact
  on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs
  and lacks the means to modernise its industry.
      ""MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not
  be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to
  regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are
  in play now,"" said one Western envoy.
      He said Polish products were not competitive, and their
  quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist
  measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper
  Poland's efforts to regain entry.
      Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised
  this fact recently.
      Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, ""Making
  up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly
  difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of
  two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of
  exports by only about 100 mln dlrs.""
      While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it
  has a ""moral right"" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says
  imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said
  ""The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing
  of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will
  just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing
  Solidarity.""
      Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in
  talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary
  Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was
  looking for a lead from the United States.
      He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its
  financial obligations to the United States, ""but not in a short
  time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its
  foreign economic partners.""
      He stressed that the U.S. ""had a particular opportunity to
  play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners
  interested in the settlement of Polish debt.""
      Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed
  Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and

  Britain had a visible trade deficit of
  2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised
  deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official
  statistics show.
      Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central
  Statistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in
  deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third
  quarter shortfall of 930 mln.
      For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3
  billion stg, sharply up from 1985's 2.2. Billion shortfall and
  a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984.
      Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the
  fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an
  estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. The fourth quarter
  figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday.
      The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to
  1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion.
      In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg.
      The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter
  was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and
  a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSO
  said.
      However, 1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg
  lower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil trade
  increased by 2.1 billion.
      The figures were broadly in line with market expectations.
      The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions,
  particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to
  substantial revisions as later information becomes available.

  OPEC crude oil output in the first few
  days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16
  mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd
  ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows.
      The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil
  traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle
  East, Africa, Latin America and Asia.
      They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the
  group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to
  a fixed price system, which came into effect last month.
      OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd
  above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the
  United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show.
      The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador,
  was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the
  survey reveals.
      But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall
  in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran""s inability to
  export as much as its quota allows.
      Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced
  1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed.
      Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to
  3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February,
  against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a
  200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production.
      Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was
  estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in
  early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share
  of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.
      Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some
  OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria,
  both substantially under quota in February and early March.
      Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to
  180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.
      Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar""s
  prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any
  shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.
      Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, down
  from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd.
      Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonny
  grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes
  from the U.K. North Sea.

  Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> earnings
  for 1986 from the U.S. Fell sharply because of difficult market
  conditions, lower crude and gas prices and also due to
  different accounting methods, Shell chairman Peter Holmes said.
      The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year,
  while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the
  contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg.
      The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the
  year to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously, with
  lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by
  volume.
      Although the figures were lower, they were nonetheless at
  the top end of market forecasts. Shell Transport and Trading
  Plc &lt;SC.L> shares, the U.K. Arm of the group, rose to 11.39 stg
  from a close last night of 11.06 stg. Analysts noted that a
  general collapse in exploration and production volumes was
  partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln
  stg from 205 mln in 1985.
      Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expected
  currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter
  results, which was the main reason for the figures exceeding
  forecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete
  Wedd noted.
      However, he added there could well be a sharp fall in
  performance in the first quarter of 1987, due to the
  improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high
  refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986.
      The impact of recovering oil prices would come through
  faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a
  high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, which
  typically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year
  lag, analysts said.
      Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third
  quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all.
      Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in
  the period, with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease in
  U.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group
  had increased share to become volume market leader, Holmes
  added.
      Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue
  U.S. Exploration activity. ""Exploration is currently pretty
  flat. We are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no
  massive upturn,"" he said.
      A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North
  Sea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel.
      Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports. ""If
  you are not exploring you are not going to find anything,"" he
  noted.
      U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day
  (bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed
  below 20 dlrs a barrel.
      This favored OPEC's attempts to stabilise prices, as the
  lower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC
  marginal production shutting down. ""OPEC has done pretty
  extraordinarily well...Everything is moving in (its) direction,""
  he added.

"training/209";"International_Trade";"3";"FRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES
  France's right wing government is facing
  growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising
  down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation
  forecasts for this year.
      Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector
  forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation
  estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its
  economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a
  2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last
  september.
      Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures
  would not push the government off its chosen mix of price
  deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.
      But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would
  push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising
  the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.
      And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed
  Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth
  and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year,
  perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential
  elections due by April 1988.
      ""The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,""
  said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. ""We have the
  impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth
  this year.""
      ""The big question is whether the government's policy of wage
  moderation will be maintained,"" he added.
      The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout
  1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises
  justified by increased productivity.
      But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond
  Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already
  rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built
  into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher
  prices.
      Calling the government's policies ""unbalanced and unjust,"" he
  also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He
  announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the
  government would spend two billion francs on a series of
  measures to boost employment and training
      Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate
  Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac
  earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of
  France's unions, declared the defence of its members earnings
  its top priority.
      But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and
  still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts
  said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.
      ""Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist
  government and I dont think this administration is going to
  reverse that,"" commented Michel Develle, economist at
  recently-privatised Banque Paribas.
      Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas
  and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher
  inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he
  said.
      Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more
  than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7
  per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.
      ""But that would still be an exceptional achievement
  considering that for the first time since the Second World War
  all french prices have been freed,"" he commented.
      Finance Ministry officials said that the governments
  abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible
  for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living
  costs.
      But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should
  have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.
      Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long
  as the government kept wages under control.
      Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of
  1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more
  than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,
  INSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better,
  he added.
      Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to
  help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget
  deficit, several analysts said.
      So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value
  Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a
  loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than
  expected growth, they said.

  French official reserves fell 45.06
  billion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from
  421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministry
  said in a statement.
      It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign
  currency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the
  European Monetary System (EMS).
      Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francs
  during the month, the ministry said.
      This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs through
  operations of the French exchange stabilisation fund,
  counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting from
  the quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held
  with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).
      But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion franc
  deficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a
  result of using very short-term financing instruments.
      The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank and
  other central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchange
  markets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, in
  an attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flight
  of funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up the
  franc.
      On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct against
  the French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency.
      The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reserves
  to 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74
  billion at end December.
      Gold reserves were unchanged at 218.45 billion francs.
      Reserves of European Currency Units fell to 73.25 billion

      The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the
  result ""of member countries' firm determination to defend the

  refrain from selling any quantity below that price.""
      The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no

  planned to start on June 25.
      The official gave no figure for February output. The
  statement said only that ""the reduction in total supplies,
  namely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local
  deliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as
  those supplies fell very noticeably during that month.""
      ""No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters
  to align the official selling price to the ongoing market
  price, member countries are, without exception, strictly
  adhering to the official selling price in spite of the
  financial hardship this may entail,"" the statement said.
      ""The very recent improvement in the price structure is an
  indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to
  the official selling price,"" the statement said.
      Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a
  barrel in early December last year to near OPEC's official
  levels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact.
      There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might

  June session to discuss reports of overproduction by some
  states and strains on the differential matrix, which prices
  each OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main

  reflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutch
  economic growth was now seen around one pct.
      Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset the
  decline in export growth caused by slowing growth in West
  Germany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar,
  Pierson said in its February economic outlook.
      The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pct
  growth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of
  2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September.
      The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and the
  government has already admitted it will not meet its goal of
  reducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990.
      Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central
  bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if
  necessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder.
      Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticised
  the guilder's revaluation in line with the West German mark in
  last January's European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and
  expressed concern over its effect on competitiveness.
      But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economy
  had become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of the
  dollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment.
      Some analysts also question the central bank's decision not
  to copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and instead
  lower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge.
      Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the move
  saying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on
  the money market, noting ""the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at the
  moment not the most important Dutch rate because it is already
  far below the market rates.""
      Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of
  the Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interest
  rate policies serve that goal.
      Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlands
  recently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being sold
  to take profits.
      Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark would
  reduce international confidence in the guilder and make it more
  dificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutch
  interest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revalued
  completely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment.
      Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decision
  not to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Pierson
  warned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder.
      Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministry
  and the central bank, with Finance Minister Onno Ruding having
  said before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lower
  Dutch rates but that the Germans should move first.
      One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates down
  to reduce the government debt burden.
      A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates were
  needed but denied any suggestion of conflicting views between
  the ministry and the central bank. ""The cabinet's policy is
  steady, the guilder has to stay with the mark,"" he said.

  U.S. retailers posted stronger than
  expected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analysts
  to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the
  first half of 1987.
       ""My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of the
  business we normally see later in the quarter and the real
  strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second
  half of 1987,"" said Bear Stearns and Co analyst Monroe
  Greenstein.
      ""I don't think March will be as strong because Easter falls
  in April this year,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb.
     Analysts generally average the sales results of March and
  April to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence.
      Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said
  sales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a
  3.6 pct increase last year.
       Analysts noted that February is considered a small,
  transitory month between winter and spring.
      In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by an
  especially soft February last year which was adversely affected
  by severe weather.
      Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales,
  according to retailers and analysts.
      ""February's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh
  merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to
  tax reductions,"" said Greenstein of Bear Stearns.
      Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of
  durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing
  high levels of consumer debt.
       May Department Stores Co &lt;MAY> and K Mart Corp &lt;KM> were
  among the strong performers, posting comparable store sales
  gains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. May had an overall
  sales gain of 15.0 pct and K Mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain 
  last month.
      ""Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programs
  continued to positively impact our sales comparisons. IN
  addition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores, all our
  specialty retailing companies had excellent February sales,""
  said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber.
      Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> posted a 4.9 pct increase.
  ""Domestic sales were led by better than average increases in
  apparel, home fashions and hardware and especially strong
  catalog sales,"" said Sears chairman Edward Brennan.
      Analysts were a little disappointed by J.C. Penney Co Inc
  &lt;JCP> which started out with especially strong sales early in
  the month. Penney posted a 5.5 pct increase on a comparitive
  store basis and a 5.3 pct gain in overall sales.
      Penney chairman William Howell said, ""store sales were
  strongest during the early part of the month, while catalog
  demand was consistently strong throughout the period.
      Store sales activity varied throughout the country, ranging
  from good in the East to weak in the depressed southwest.
      Analysts also said gross profit margins were high as
  retailers were not overly promotional due to leaner inventories
  than a year ago.
      ""February is not a big month seasonally but these numbers
  suggest a fairly good trend for consumer spending,"" said Drexel

  Domestic demand is now expected to make
  no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal
  1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all
  of the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here.
      However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic
  Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise
  in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised.
      But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this
  financial year and net export growth will provide the total
  source of gdp growth.
      The August budget had forecast domestic demand would
  contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5
  pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.
      Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic
  parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a
  slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit
  than first anticipated.
      ""The government initially forecast a current account deficit
  for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that
  the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion,"" he said.
      Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC
  in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is
  broadly on track, Keating said.
      ""They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more
  sluggish than was expected at budget time,"" he said.
      ""On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more
  than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth
  in domestic production and employment.""
      Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation
  rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.
      ""Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in
  inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary
  effects wane,"" he said.
      Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick
  up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in
  net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from
  private domestic demand.
      He said domestic demand growth will be due to a
  strengthening in real household disposable income.
      The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year
  should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level
  broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.
      ""The current account deficit will continue to show
  improvement in 1987/88,"" Keating said.
      ""As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent
  years recede further, and given continued effective wage
  restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88,"" he
  said.

  Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman
  Manuel Johnson said that maintaining price stability was
  critical to achieving non-inflationary economic growth in the
  world and said that progress was being made.
      ""It is worth reiterating that the Federal Reserve's
  promotion of price stability is critical to the successful
  implementation of virtually all of the important ingredients
  for growth,"" he told the Eastern Economic Association.
      Johnson said initial progress has been made on a variety of
  fronts. ""Federal Reserve monetary policy, the
  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation, the G-6 agreement, and the
  Baker debt initiative for example all have moved us in the
  right direction,"" he said. G-6 is comprised of U.S., Britain,
  France, Japan, West Germany and Canada.
      On the budget deficit, Johnson said meeting precise
  numerical goals was less important than a continuing commitment
  toward slowing the growth of federal spending.
      There was evidence deficits as a pct of Gross National
  Product were declining and would continue to drop, he said.
      But Johnson warned against reliance on inflow of foreign
  capital to finance investment and the budget deficit and keep
  interest rates stable.
      ""This situation, however, cannot continue indefinitely.
  Sooner or later progress must be made in controlling excessive
  federal spending,"" he said.
      A disinflationary monetary policy should continue to be the
  main objective of the Fed, Johnson said.
      He also said a more stable and sustainable alignment of
  exchange rates was needed for long-term growth.
      On the trade deficit, Johnson warned against ""quick fix""
  solutions, which he identified as excessive dollar depreciation
  or protectionist trade legislation.
      ""What is important is that we attempt to maintain healthy
  returns to capital and adopt policies encouraging genuine
  economic growth,"" he said.
      Such an approach would finance the trade deficit but allow
  for its gradual resolution over time.

"training/2352";"International_Trade";"3";"YEUTTER SAYS BUDGET CUT KEY TO BETTER U.S. TRADE
  A reduction of the U.S. federal budget
  deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation's huge
  trade deficit, U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter said.
      Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
  Yeutter said ""Capital and trade flows are clearly
  inter-releated now.
      ""Unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get the
  trade deficit down.""
      He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between
  the two deficits.
      Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S.
  budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas
  investors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and, to a lesser
  extent, other U.S. securities as well.
      ""We'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr
  trade deficit in 1987, but there's still a long way to go,""
  Yeutter said.
      He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and
  focus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetary
  policies to foster economic growth, U.S. competitiveness and
  the establishment of a ""level playing field"" for trade.
      The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserve
  under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the
  trade situation by getting interest rates down.
      On the fiscal side, Yeutter said ""the budget deficit is
  still our biggest problem"" and there has not been enough
  progress toward reducing that deficit.
      In the international area, he said that ""our major trading
  partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth.""
  Commenting on Japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlr
  trade surplus with the United States, Yeutter said ""Japan is
  just not doing the job on the import side.""
      Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the
  dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of
  Economic Affairs Robert Ortner.
      In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored
  meeting, Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels
  was fairly priced against most European currencies, but that
  the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued.
      ""The market will determine the dollar's proper value in the
  end,"" Yeutter said. However, he added that, if the U.S. and
  other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S.
  trade deficit, ""the dollar will be the equalizer.""
      Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and
  any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation
  or trade restrictions poses real dangers.
      He said ""there's relatively little that Congress can do to
  legislate a solution to the trade problem.""
      Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by
  U.S. trading partners, Yeutter said.
      ""There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our
  trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade
  legislation,"" Yeutter said, adding that policy flexibility is
  essential in solving international trade problems.

  Australia accused the U.S. of increasing
  protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to
  Washington's special 32-year exemption from certain GATT rules
  on agricultural trade.
      Robert Arnott, Australia's delegate to the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), made the appeal at a
  special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver.
      ""Australia today said the United States' goals of reducing
  U.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by
  actions which in fact increased protection in trade in
  agriculture,"" the Australian delegation said in a statement.
      ""The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic
  flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture,"" Arnott told the
  meeting.
      Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a
  justification for ""dubious protective measures"" by the U.S. He
  listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to
  close the U.S. sugar market to imports.
      He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington to
  impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic
  support programs. This covered imports of dairy products,
  peanuts, cotton and sugar.
      Asked to comment, Michael Samuels, U.S. ambassador to the
  GATT, told Reuters: ""These charges have been made since the very
  beginning. The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agricultural
  policy, part of our law when we joined the GATT"".
      ""We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the
  Uruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with
  their programs. We can negotiate them all,"" Samuels added.
      Ninety-two nations are taking part in the four-year Uruguay
  round of talks launched in Punta del Este last September.
  Bargaining in agricultural goods and services (banking,
  tourism, insurance) is included for the first time as well as
  manufactured goods.

  Kuwait""s Oil Minister, in remarks
  published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC
  meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world
  oil prices.
      Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local
  daily al-Qabas as saying: ""None of the OPEC members has asked
  for such a meeting.""
      He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000
  barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production
  limits of the 13-nation organisation.
      Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate
  OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln
  bpd agreed in Geneva last December.
      They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with
  the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above
  quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.
      ""This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said
  Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that
  because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,"" the minister
  said.
      Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to
  produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.
      ""If we can sell more than our quota at official prices,
  while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their
  share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,"" he said.
      He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar,
  which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd
  of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting
  official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker
  of 18 dlrs per barrel.
      Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels
  this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of
  19 dollars a barrel.
      Sheikh Ali also delivered ""a challenge to any international
  oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.""
      Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a
  barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.
      However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because
  of its local and international refining facilities and its own
  distribution network abroad, he added.
      He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC""s
  differentials committee has been postponed until the start of
  April at the request of certain of the body""s members.
      Ecuador""s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said
  last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign
  a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at
  talks this month of opec""s pricing committee.
      Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in
  apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: ""We
  expected such pressure. It will continue through March and
  April."" But he expected the situation would later improve.

  Indonesia appears to be nearing a
  political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected
  economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.
      To counter falling oil revenues, the government has
  launched a series of measures over the past nine months to
  boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new
  investment.
      Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading
  primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year""s
  fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its
  currency by 31 pct in September.
      But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto""s
  government appears to be divided over what direction to lead
  the economy.
      ""(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to
  deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,""
  the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia""s agricultural
  sector, but also reviews the country""s general economic
  performance.
      It says that while many government officials and advisers
  are recommending further relaxation, ""there are equally strong
  pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.""
      ""This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,""
  the report says.
      Indonesia""s economic changes have been welcomed by the World
  Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction,
  though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and
  steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.
      Three sets of measures have been announced since last May,
  which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade
  restrictions and liberalised imports.
      The report says Indonesia""s economic growth in calendar 1986
  was probably about zero, and the economy may even have
  contracted a bit. ""This is the lowest rate of growth since the
  mid-1960s,"" the report notes.
      Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a
  population of 168 million, is facing general elections in
  April.
      But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement
  in the economic outlook. ""For 1987 early indications point to a
  slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic
  activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export
  earnings from the petroleum industry.""
      ""Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak
  domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real
  declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of
  growth in agriculture,"" the report states.
      Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is
  crucial for the government to get the international lending its
  needs.
      A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance
  of payments support was given partly to help the government
  maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.

  Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman
  said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd
  ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been
  delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec
  prices.
      Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from
  Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in
  February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were
  strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they
  were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official
  prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
      ""We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,""
  he said. ""I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they
  are committed to making the accord work,"" he said.
      Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He
  said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these
  figures.
      Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated
  that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he
  said; ""That could well be correct.""
      Opec""s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying
  group output was ""well below"" its ceiling in February. But it
  gave no figures.
      But one source close to Opec indicated that February output
  may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd.
      The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around
  16 mln bpd.
      Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8
  mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1.
      Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all
  produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said
  it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December
  pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said.
      Lukman said that some industry reports ""may be correct"" that
  in February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238
  mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln
  allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota.
      He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his
  country were coming under price pressure because they were
  currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and
  the United States"" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude.
      However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that
  demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons
  and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.
      ""We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is
  now firming on actual fundamentals,"" he said, adding that he
  expected it to go ""up and up"" even beyond official prices after
  early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand
  for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria""s.
      The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela
  and Indonesia were having less problems with output than
  producers like his own country because they exported oil
  products.
      Also, some of Venezuela""s heavy grades were outside the Opec
  pricing system, he said.
      Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift
  some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks
  and ran them down to ""dangerous levels,"" they would eventually
  have to buy Opec oil.
      ""When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market)
  they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more
  later on,"" he said.
      Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being
  pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was
  important to know that terms with them were negotiable,
  flexible and under constant review, not only when the market
  seemed weak.
      He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation
  ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that
  such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority
  for Opec at the moment.
      ""At this time, we have to get our priorities right,"" he said.
  ""The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is
  working, not dealing with a differential of cents between

  Top U.S. and European farm trade and
  government representatives called for a sweeping reform of
  world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply
  imbalance.
      Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here
  demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for
  an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and
  production.
      ""It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and
  harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the
  disruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls of
  protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation
  become more harmful,"" U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy
  Administrator William Bailey said.
      Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, which
  ends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to
  adjust its policies to the changing market environment.
      The need for urgent reforms is justified by the ""imbalance
  and tensions of the world economy,"" the secretary general of the
  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
  Jean-Claude Paye said.
      And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on
  Tariffs and Trade, he noted.
      Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint
  reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures
  to help farmers in unprofitable areas.
      Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm
  prices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, and
  instead help farmers through income support and adjustment
  aids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president of
  Cargill (USA), one of the world's largest cereal houses.
      Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West German
  Chancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must take
  greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices.
      However, ""differentiated policy treatment is required"" to
  take account of large disparities in the situation around the
  EC, he said.
      ""Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy
  and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the
  Community,"" he said.

  The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering
  slightly from last year's decline in world oil prices,
  announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a
  deficit of 5.472 billion riyals.
      The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals
  in the last published budget for 1985/86.
      In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year
  1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh
  Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to
  spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.
      Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6
  billion riyals.
      Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about
  6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86
  projected revenue of 9.7 billion.
      The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to
  uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.
      Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government
  decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to
  one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15
  pct.
      He urged heads of government departments and public
  institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He
  did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.
      Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in
  1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on
  the country's foreign reserves.
      He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been
  allocated for major projects including housing and public
  buildings, social services, health, education, transport and
  communications, electricity and water, industry and
  agriculture.
      No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and
  security. There was also no projection for oil revenue.
      Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000
  barrels per day.
      Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: ""Our expectations of positive signs
  regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's
  determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its
  wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming
  year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota.""

  Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
  reiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC
  accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market, the
  official Saudi Press Agency SPA said.
      Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market
  oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia ""is fully adhering by the
  ... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the
  pronounced prices under any circumstance.""
      Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market
  prices ""may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere)
  winter season and the glut in the market.""
      Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord,
  under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by
  7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed
  prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
      The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets,
  which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in
  mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices
  are currently just over 16 dlrs.
      Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's
  adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market.
      He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all
  wanted to stick to the accord.
      In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also
  Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the
  pricing agreement.
      ""We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate
  the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the
  fundamentals exist for stable market conditions,"" he said.
      Kuwait's Oil Minister, Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said
  in remarks published in the emirate's daily Al-Qabas there were
  no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices.
      Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate
  OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling.
      They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with
  the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above
  quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing.

  Brazil's recent announcement of a
  suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign
  debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views
  among many international economists and commodities analysts
  that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987.
      The developing world's most indebted nation is also its
  most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as
  coffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchange
  revenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said.
      ""That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is no
  way they can trade their way out of this situation,"" Aldo
  Roldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase
  Econometrics, said.
      Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the
  problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted
  world markets, but also had to work to make its position on
  foreign exchange markets more profitable.
      ""Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and
  exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange
  rates,"" Roldan said.
      The Chase economist also said commodities markets were
  depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a
  country like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50
  pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23
  billion dlrs.
      But he added: ""They are always pretty aggressive and they
  have good foreign marketing channels.""
      Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be
  coffee, and even without background pressure from foreign
  creditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the
  market this year with a vengeance.
      Negotiations between International Coffee Organization
  (ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up
  earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing
  each other of intransigence.
      ""Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,
  which others wanted changed,"" one senior coffee dealer said.
      The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to
  preserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said
  Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others
  would suffer.
      Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but
  as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the
  dealer said.
      ""If they do come into the market at this level it will go
  lower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,""
  he said.
      New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents
  lower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant
  deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.
      President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster
  told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has
  no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of
  the ICO talks on export quotas.
      Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the
  focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. ""They
  will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,""
  according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache
  Securities Inc.
      Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus
  difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the
  Brazil soybean crop. ""Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and
  they can't afford to store the crops,"" he said.
      The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time
  about large South American crops developing under near ideal
  conditions towards record yields.
      ""We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than
  usual, this year in our (U.S.) exports,"" Loewy said.
      Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean
  Association (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest
  could total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.
      Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices
  are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the
  vulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.
      Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a
  reduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to
  farmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.
      He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the
  soybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices
  by keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can
  forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the
  loan.
      ""We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are
  starting to harvest and starting to export,"" Eshleman said. But
  he added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below
  10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.
      Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel
  Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much
  as it can this year because of its economic situation.
      He said the debt situation was a major consideration. ""The
  Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for
  storage,"" he added.
      Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil
  would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said
  it would not make a big difference.
      On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may be
  muted no matter its need to generate capital.
      Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which
  could limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The
  country may have oversold and be unable to honor export
  commitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by
  consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will
  give it little room to stretch exports, they said.
      Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of
  surplus. ""Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it
  fell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and
  find many more markets for it,"" one analyst said.
      ""If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would
  collapse and they can't afford to do that,"" she added.

  Momentum in th U.S. economy may be
  picking up given solid across-the board increases in the
  February U.S. employment report, economists said.
      U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February,
  twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a
  319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously
  reported 448,000 increase.
      ""Even if you look at January and February together, this is
  still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in
  the market,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation.
      Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much
  larger gains in February U.S. production and income than
  previously forecast.
      The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from
  34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose
  0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since
  November 1966, the Commerce Department said.
      ""The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very
  large increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7
  pct,"" said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4
  pct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.
      Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc
  noted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour
  in February from 8.83 dlrs in January.
      ""Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means
  we'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis
  the wage and salary disbursement,"" he said.
      Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should
  rise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.
      He said the February employment gains are consistent with
  his firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national product
  growth forecast of 3.7 pct.
      Economists agreed that the employment data were negative
  for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy
  and no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. But
  most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.
      ""This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider
  easing,"" said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.  
    ""It gives them more room to address the dollar situation,"" he
  said. ""If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so,
  but it's most likely they'll sit and wait.""
      ""The data have not been uniform,"" Stone added. ""Durable
  goods were weak in January and now employment is strong.""
      In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct,
  followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S.
  retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap
  widened to 14.8 billion dlrs.
      ""Things just aren't adding up,"" said Steve Slifer of Lehman
  Goverment Securities Inc. ""Consumer spending, capital spending,
  goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first
  quarter GNP growth of one pct,"" he said.
      ""The employment and production data point to a big
  inventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourth
  quarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth.""
      Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000
  in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was
  accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery
  industries returning to work.
      Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains
  have resulted from an improving trade outlook.
      Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S.
  trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports
  grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in
  imports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve
  in the first quarter.
      ""Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter,
  but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper
  products, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show
  that trade is improving,"" Benderley said.
      ""The economy is moving between extremes,"" he said. ""Some
  reports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter
  GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct.""
      A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater
  part of February's employment gain. Retail services employment
  rose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in
  January, previously reported at 166,000.
      Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But
  this follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down
  from a previously reported 142,000 gain.
      The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in
  February at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at
  6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since
  March 1980, the Commerce Department noted.
      ""The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,""
  Carson said. ""This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease,
  but there's no reason to tighten. It's way too early for that.""

  The Belgian government, which
  introduced large-scale public spending reductions last year,
  has been told by an International Monetary Fund team there is
  scope for further cuts in 1988.
      The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions
  of the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economic
  policy, a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the
  weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet.
      The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interest
  rate policy, with a particular emphasis on long-term rates.
      The team's report to the government praises last year's
  spending cuts, which are due to reduce 1987 government spending
  by 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy
  perform ""better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far in
  the 1980s.""
      However, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisation
  of the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much
  lower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the
  government has set itself for 1989.
      The government's net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of
  GNP in 1986.
      The report says ""The most that can be afforded over the next
  few years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of
  general Government.""
      It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian tax
  system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax
  burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the
  debt to GNP ratio before this is possible.
      ""Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure
  growth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions,
  we feel that your position would be stronger if you could
  decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988,"" the
  report adds.
      The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the
  government's determination to keep its currency strong and to
  curb inflation.
      It says firmer long-term rates would slow private net
  long-term capital outflows, which increased strongly in 1986.
      It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and
  an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the
  subscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues in

  Saudi crude oil output last month fell
  to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd
  in January, Gulf oil sources said.
      They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah
  terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month
  from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some
  customers.
      But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf
  exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd
  from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.
      The production figures include neutral zone output but not
  sales from floating storage, which are generally considered
  part of a country's output for Opec purposes.
      Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a
  production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group
  last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs
  a barrel.
      The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week
  appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February
  entitlements before the month-end.
      Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued
  support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude
  customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said.
      The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Texaco Inc
  &lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement
  last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.
      However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's
  ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will
  come this month, when demand for petroleum products
  traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent
  weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels.
      Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday
  reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord
  and said it would never sell below official prices.
      The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell
  slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in
  January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export
  refineries.
      They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd
  last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at
  Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady
  at around 200,000 bpd each.

  U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 
  dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price
  could rise another dollar as inventories fall.
      ""OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market
  there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time
  to major refining centers,"" said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst
  with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. ""That could send prices
  50 cts to a dollar higher,"" he added.
      The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to
  18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.
      The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in
  February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a
  barrel.
      ""Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that
  oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its
  15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come
  under question,"" McKinley said.
      Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly
  report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in
  industrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during
  the first quarter of this year.
      IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first
  quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose
  inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln
  tonnes, or about 74 days consumption.
      Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd
  draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday
  fed speculation that other major companies were destocking.
      Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a
  so-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying
  officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization
  to offer discounts to the official price.
      ""This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the
  ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively
  soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),""
  the general trading manager of an international oil company
  told Reuters in a telephone interview.
      For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting
  excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own
  output, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to
  be 14.7 mln bpd this week.
      Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend
  oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.
      ""This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000
  bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues,
  the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting
  it to be there,"" McKinley said.
      International oil traders said that other short-haul
  crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian
  refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily
  available Mideast crudes earlier this week.
      If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up
  the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading
  managers at several companies told Reuters.
      But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long
  OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.
      Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity
  Management, said OPEC production was lower ""because of the
  Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it
  gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.""
       He added, ""The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other
  members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the
  Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low
  as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price,"" he added.
      There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the
  spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.
      Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery
  into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which
  traded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of
  18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.
      Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far
  East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.
      ""There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government
  deals, which are below official prices and this is probably
  being resold,"" one international trader said.

  expected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S.
  interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive
  chart outlook, financial analysts said.
      The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment
  during February was above market expectations for a rise of
  170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond
  futures that drove the June contract through key technical
  support at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted.
      ""I don't like that fact that we had a close below 101,""
  said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. The 101-2/32 level
  in the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month
  trading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday
  led to bullish forecasts by chartists.
      But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly
  charts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday.
      Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32
  may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep
  losses.
      ""I tend to go along with the double top scenario,"" said
  Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico.
      Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the fact
  that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has
  occurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals.
      Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leiner
  remains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should find
  support between 100 and 99-16/32 next week.
      The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiner's expectation
  that the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based on
  an improving inflation outlook.
      With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal
  Reserve little room to ease monetary policy, ""the inflation
  outlook is improving,"" Leiner said, and that should lead to
  relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar
  prices.
      Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices
  remains a concern for the inflation outlook.
      Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were
  maintaining production quotas and official prices, and got an
  extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from
  Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday.
      ""The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon,""
  said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer.
      The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely
  ""media induced,"" Singer said. He noted that even though OPEC
  production may be within quotas, ""oil stocks are at
  tremendously high levels.""
      Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay, oil
  prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February, he
  said, and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices.

  The Treasury proposed allowing 
  temporary imports of South African uranium ore and uranium
  oxide until July 1 under certain conditions pending
  clarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by Congress last
  fall.
      The proposal to be published in the Federal Register next
  week requests written congressional and public comment within
  60 days and deals with uranium ore and oxide that is imported
  for U.S. processing and exporting to third countries.
      The Treasury said it proposed allowing the temporary

  passed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall
  -- overriding President Reagan's veto -- to hurt U.S. industry.
      ""The domestic uranium conversion industry and the federal
  government's enrichment industry could be seriously injured in
  a manner not intended by Congress if the . . . import ban on
  uranium ore and oxide were implemented to bar imports for
  processing and export through a mistaken interpretation of the
  act,"" the Treasury brief said.
      The Treasury said an outright U.S. ban of uranium ore and
  oxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert their
  South African origin ore and oxide to other countries including
  the Soviet Union for processing.
      Treasury said it would allow imports of the South African
  ore and oxide until July 1 for processing and re-export
  ""provided that the imported ore or oxide is accompanies by a

  under bond,"" the brief said.
      The South African sanctions law, enacted by the United

  OPEC member Ecuador adopted austerity
  measures to conserve fuel after oil production was paralyzed by
  a strong earthquake.
      Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa announced on
  television the country would cut domestic fuel sales by 30 pct.
  A ministry statement had earlier announced indefinite
  suspension of crude oil exports, declaring force majeure.
      Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a

  oil fields to the Pacific Ocean coast.
      The quake on Thursday, which registered six on the 12-point

  the Reventador volcano about 90 km (50 miles) east of Quito.
      Ecuador had recently been pumping 260,000 barrels per day.
      The government's austerity measures ban the sale of
  aviation fuel to foreign airliners on international routes and
  no fuel will be available for ships owned by foreign lines.

  Senior officials in the West German
  coalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would
  be increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made
  by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month's
  international monetary conference in Paris.
      Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social
  Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also
  attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and
  Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion
  mark reduction would represent net tax relief.
      An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned.
      The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts
  already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks.
      Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief
  would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal
  increase in income tax.
      An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers
  1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose
  children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the
  tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by
  increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and
  medium-sized companies.
      The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of
  a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect
  in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this
  reform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would
  be introduced next year, ahead of schedule.
      The West German government had come under pressure from the
  United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But
  Stoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, while
  the economy would continue to expand this year, the rate of
  growth was uncertain.
      The government said in January it was aiming for real
  growth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but some
  economists have revised their predictions down to two or below.
      Stoltenberg said: ""We remain on a course of expansion.
  Whether (this will be) under two pct, as some people believe,
  or around 2.5 pct as some others expect, or even closer to
  three pct, as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a few
  days ago, remains open at the moment.""

  The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil
  shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at
  least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.
      The official said Ecuador could resume exports after
  repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links
  jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.
  It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,
  the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
  Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35
  days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.
      The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the
  12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the
  pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil
  accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as
  60 pct of government revenues.
      Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation
  of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping
  about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd
  above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy
  Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of
  173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.
      However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,
  costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian
  pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take
  about 60 days to build.
      Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,
  had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end
  of January, about equal to one month's imports.
      It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion
  dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's
  total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in
  Latin America.
      In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would
  loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three
  months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.
      Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies
  and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in
  repayment in May, Lusinchi said.
      A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister
  Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior
  and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de
  Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and
  co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

  Japanese customers have bought nearly six
  mln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company
  (NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, and
  Western traders have received even larger discounts, Japanese
  traders involved in the transactions told Reuters.
      NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese
  customers with different formulas. One company has bought
  800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of
  30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said.
      Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and
  Dubai spot prices less a discount, they said.
  
      Iran's discounted sales have not, however, managed to
  reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot
  markets, oil traders said.
      Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder
  weather in Europe, and reports that OPEC's February output was
  below its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day.
      Firmer gas oil on the London futures, and more bullish
  sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market
  are supporting spot price levels, they said.
  
      Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price
  but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a
  discount, the sources said. ""It's just disguised cheating,"" one
  Japanese trader said.
      The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the
  official price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.5 mln
  barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in
  Singapore. They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude have
  been sold to Western traders with pricing based 60 pct on the

  The 24 nations of the Organisation for
  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by
  sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic
  growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into
  deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.
      The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD
  economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a
  2.8 pct growth forecast in December.
      It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the
  smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest
  hit by currency appreciation this year.
      The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth
  rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in
  December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.
      It said it expected the OECD to post a current account
  deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in
  large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.
      It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to
  fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in
  1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.
      It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr
  payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.
      The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50
  dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18
  dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes
  increasingly ragged.
      It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in
  foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its
  trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last
  year's 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at
  1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate
  is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an
  average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.
      ""This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper
  angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball
  rather than a three-point landing,"" the EIU said.
      ""Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the
  February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and
  Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to
  more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter
  U.S. Fsical policy,"" it said.
      It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the
  willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government
  assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.
      ""Thus far they have been willing,"" the EIC said, adding
  that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollar
  would collapse.
      To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates
  would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt
  crisis, it said.
      On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look
  ""increasingly sick.""
      Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen
  slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to
  4.2 pct in 1988, it said.
      The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest
  single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a
  sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in
  December, the EIU said.
      On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West
  Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while
  Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.
  Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more
  competitively-priced dollar.
      It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and
  oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.

  Dutch economic growth is slowing as a
  firming guilder cuts competitiveness abroad and industries
  reduce the pace of investment, the Dutch official planning
  agency CPB said.
      The Centraal Planbureau, publishing its 1987 economic
  outlook, said Dutch Net National Income (NNI) was expected to
  grow by one pct this year, down from two pct growth recorded in
  1986 and 2.5 pct in 1985 and 1984.
      Dutch Gross National Product is expected to rise to 432.20
  billion guilders in 1987 in constant prices, a two pct increase
  from last year's 423.95 billion.
      The CPB, forecasting an 8.5 pct increase in the value of
  the guilder on a trade-weighted basis compared with 10.0 pct
  last year, said the dollar was expected to trade at an average
  of 2.0 guilders in 1987 compared with 2.45 guilders in 1986.
      ""The higher guilder is causing a substantial fall in unit
  labour costs abroad, when measured in guilder terms, while
  these are rising slightly in the Netherlands,"" the CPB said.
      More of economic growth now depended on domestic
  consumption, the CPB said, but noting that higher margins set
  by domestic producers and importers mitigated the effect on
  purchasing power of lower import costs and deflation.
      Consumer prices were set to fall by 1.5 pct this year, the
  CPB said. Inflation was zero last year.
      Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by five
  pct this year, a slowdown compared with 11.5 pct growth last
  year, the CPB said.
      Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue to
  condition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recent
  years, the CPB said, noting a continued depressing impact of
  these factors on Dutch competitiveness.
      In addition, it noted a slight rise in taxation and social
  security costs to employers.
      The CPB, forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 7.2
  pct of Net National Income in 1987 from 6.3 pct last year,
  urged the government to cut expenditure further to bring down
  the deficit and reduce tax and social security payments in
  future.
      Dutch government revenue is being depressed further by
  falling income from natural gas sales in 1987, the CPB said.
      It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675,000 this
  year from 710,000 last year.
      While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB is
  within its latest forecast, issued last month, of 1.5 to two
  pct growth, the figure is well above recent market estimates.
      Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson said in
  its February economic outlook that GDP growth at constant
  prices was expected to be 1.1 pct this year and market analysts
  had expected the CPB's final forecast to be below its own
  latest estimate.
      ""It is too early to comment because I haven't seen the whole
  document yet, but it would seem we are more pessimistic in some
  of our estimates,"" a Pierson economist said.
      The CPB forecast 2.5 pct export growth in volume terms in
  1987, after four pct growth last year. Excluding energy
  exports, the 1987 figure would be two pct, it said.
      Imports were set to rise by 4.5 pct this year compared with
  four pct in 1986 in volume terms, the CPB said.
      The balance of payments would see a sharp decline in the
  surplus, to six billion guilders in 1987 compared with 12.1
  billion last year, the CPB forecast.

  West Germany takes ""very seriously"" the
  recent undertaking by major industrial countries to promote
  exchange rate stability around current levels, Finance Ministry
  State Secretary Hans Tietmeyer said.
      Talking to journalists before a meeting of European
  Community Economy and Finance Ministers here, Tietmeyer
  declined to say whether the February 22 Paris accord by the
  Group of Five countries plus Canada included secret agreements
  for stabilising currencies.
      But he noted the official communique said the participants
  agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange
  rates around current levels. ""We're taking this sentence very
  seriously,"" he said.
      Tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved against
  the mark since the meeting.
      He said a slowdown in West German economic growth had been
  caused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the Paris
  agreement should help in this respect.
      Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said the
  Bonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster the
  economy but was paying close attention to the slower growth and
  had not ruled out ""appropriate and timely"" action if necessary.
      Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussion
  by the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on the
  economic situation in the 12-nation bloc.
      The Commission has sharply revised down expected German
  gross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pct
  predicted last autumn and says Bonn has the most room of any EC
  country to stimulate economic activity.
      Schlecht said the upturn in West Germany's economy slowed
  in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of
  1987. But he said there was no cumulative downwards trend in
  view that would make quick remedial action necessary.
      He said a number of favourable indicators such as high
  level of investment and a good climate for consumption meant a
  recovery could be expected, while exports would pick up
  slightly during the course of the year.

  The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil
  shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at
  least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.
      The official said Ecuador could resume exports after
  repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links
  jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.
  It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,
  the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
  Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35
  days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.
      The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the
  12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the
  pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil
  accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as
  60 pct of government revenues.
      Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation
  of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping
  about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd
  above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy
  Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of
  173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.
      However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,
  costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian
  pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take
  about 60 days to build.
      Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,
  had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end
  of January, about equal to one month's imports.
      It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion
  dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's
  total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in
  Latin America.
      In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would
  loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three
  months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.
      Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies
  and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in
  repayment in May, Lusinchi said.
      A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister
  Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior
  and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de
  Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and
  co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

  The 24 nations of the Organisation for
  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by
  sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic
  growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into
  deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.
      The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD
  economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a
  2.8 pct growth forecast in December.
      It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the
  smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest
  hit by currency appreciation this year.
      The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth
  rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in
  December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.
      It said it expected the OECD to post a current account
  deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in
  large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.
      It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to
  fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in
  1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.
      It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr
  payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.
      The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50
  dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18
  dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes
  increasingly ragged.
      It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in
  foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its
  trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last
  year's 18.4 pct drop.
      The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year
  and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break
  through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in
  1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.
      ""This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle
  of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather
  than a three-point landing,"" the EIU said.
      ""Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the
  February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and
  Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to
  more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter
  U.S. Fiscal policy,"" it said.
      It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the
  willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government
  assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.
      ""Thus far they have been willing,"" the EIC said, adding that
  if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would
  collapse.
      To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates
  would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt
  crisis, it said.
      On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look ""increasingly
  sick.""
      Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen
  slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to
  4.2 pct in 1988, it said.
      The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest
  single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a
  sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in
  December, the EIU said.
      On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West
  Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while
  Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.
  Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more
  competitively-priced dollar.
      It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and
  oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.
      However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over
  the current OECD average of three pct. Non-oil commodity prices
  will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first
  time since 1984, the EIU said.
      After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price of
  internationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in
  1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said.
      It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6
  pct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986.

"training/3078";"International_Trade";"3";"STUDY SAYS U.S., CANADA PACT WOULD SPUR ECONOMIES
  A free trade pact between the United
  States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides
  substantially, according to a study released by the Institute
  for International Economics.
      The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusion
  to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada's
  gross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S.
  export's by about seven pct.
      He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of
  government subsidies, end curbs on trade in services and
  investments and pave the way for new global talks under the 
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
      The United States and Canada - the world's two biggest
  trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150
  billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. They
  are aiming for a pact by next October.
      Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity of
  Maryland, said an agreement should include:
      - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phased
  in over a five to 10-year period;
      - Equal access to federal government procurement in the two
  countries, replacing current ""Buy America"" and ""Buy Canada""
  provisions with a ""Buy North America"" provision;
      - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly finance
  and transportation;
      - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor
  domestic producers;
      - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes.
       Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, the
  two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to
  2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties.
      The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct.
      He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset
  subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for
  resolution at an early stage.
      Wonnacott said ""bilateral free trade would contribute to the
  efficiency of the North American economies and to their
  competitiveness in facing overseas producers.
      He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadian
  goods and enable them to benefit from the economies of mass
  production.
      Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those to
  Canada proportionately, he said, because of the already large
  U.S. gross national product.
      Wonnacott said also that a U.S.-Canada pact in such areas
  as export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commission
  could set an example for the current attempt by GATT to write
  new and more liberal global trading regulations.

  Petro-Canada, Canada's
  state-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineation
  wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore
  Newfoundland.
      Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work
  should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development
  plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said.
      Depending on time required for regulatory approvals,
  construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as
  early as 1991, Petro-Canada said.
      ""We have a high degree of confidence that the western
  portion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mln
  cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels,
  and that we could produce it economicly using a floating
  production system,"" Petro-Canada said.
      The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St.
  John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was
  discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984.
      ""We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion of
  the field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove up
  additional reserves there,"" the company said.
      Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial
  prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources
  towards development so it can start generating a return on
  investments, Petro-Canada said.
      Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells,
  has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of
  the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's East
  Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field
  participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd,
  Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium
  Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX.
      Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field's
  Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil,
  company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada's Calgary
  office.
      Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field's East
  Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels,
  he added.
      Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs
  to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the
  development budget could double if the company builds a
  production system combining both blocks in the field, he said.
      Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block
  would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily
  production, with a production system that would have maximum
  capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in
  answer to a query.
      The company estimates a production system combining both
  Graven and East Flank blocks in the Terra Nova field could
  produce about 45,000 bpd average daily production, he said.

  This year will see a pickup in U.S.

  said in its semi-annual policy statement.
      The SOMC, a group of basically ""monetarist"" private
  economists, said that ""economic growth will accelerate in 1987
  in response to powerful stimulative actions by the Federal
  Reserve.""
      The group said the Fed's actions have been excessive. As a
  result, it said that ""inflation and ultimately another
  recession now loom on the horizon.""
      The SOMC said that central bank policies that rely on
  progressively larger swings in monetary expansion will not lead
  to sustainable economic growth and stable prices.
      The group made no specific nominal forecasts of economic or
  inflation growth in its policy statement. However, the
  Committee at its Sunday policy-making meeting said it was
  basically in accord with projections by Jerry Jordan, who is a
  member of the SOMC and economist at First Interestate Bancorp.
      Jordan expects real GNP growth to be about one percentage
  point higher than in the past two years. He expects consumer
  prices to rise about 4-1/2 pct this year.
      The SOMC said in recent months rapid money growth has been

  its inflationary policy and set the growth rate of the monetary
  base on the path toward sustained lower inflation.""

  fall to six billion guilders during 1987.
      The visible goods surplus excluding energy fell by 5.6

  spending and investment increased.
      While the energy trade balance surplus rose by 5.4 billion

  improvements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delay

  uncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable,
  lengthy and steep world recession.""
      Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 the
  dollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major
  industrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broader
  group of currencies of nearly all developing nations.
      At the end of 1986, he said, the value of foreign assets in
  the U.S. exceeded the value of U.S. assets abroad by 240
  billion dlrs, compared to five years ago when the U.S. had a
  surplus in assets of 141 billion. A company spokesman said the
  data were provided by economic consultants to USX.
      The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct
  rise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985, although other
  factors were involved, Roderick said. But it is wrong, he said,
  ""to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental
  deterioration of U.S. productivity or of American product
  quality.""
      These areas need to be improved but they are not the root
  cause of the trade gap problem, Roderick said. He urged
  American manufacturers to become more competitive so they can
  compete in global markets.
      In the speech, the USX chairman also called for changes in
  securities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate
  raiders and speculators.
      Among his proposals, which he presented to the Senate
  Banking Committee in testimony last week, were a requirement
  that raiders give 24-hour notice for every one pct of stock
  they acquire in a company.
      Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all
  cash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be
  required to have financing in place before a tender is made.
      Further, raiders should be required to make an all-cash
  tender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target company's
  stock, he said. And payment of greenmail, or a preferential
  price by a target company to buy back a raider's stake, should
  be prohibited under the revised laws.
      Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but
  that he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets
  or discourage ""fair price to all"" takeovers.

  The dollar will decline over the next

  Anthony Solomon, chairman of S.G. Warburg (USA) Inc and former
  president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
      In a presentation to the Japan Society, Solomon said
  without elaboration that he expects a ""significant decline in

      ""The dollar will fall more, but the current account deficit
  will stop being reduced when it reaches its structural core,""

      Solomon described the structural core as about one-half of
  the current 150 billion dlr annual deficit. He cited several
  factors which will prevent an elimination of the deficit.
      For one thing, it is unlikely that there will be any new
  investment in those manufacturing industries that shrank when
  the dollar was at uncompetitive levels, he said.
      In addition, he said that the U.S. has an increased
  propensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes.
      Solomon forecast inflation at 4.5 pct by year-end, but said
  it could be kept below five pct in the medium-term if oil

  European Community finance ministers
  discussed the economic outlook for the 12-nation bloc and many

      The Commission, the EC's executive authority, two weeks ago
  cut its forecast for economic growth in the Community to 2.3
  per cent for this year from 2.8 per cent predicted last autumn.
      It said economic prospects had been less promising over the

  restrain Community exports.
      But diplomats said several member states, led by West
  Germany, Britain and France, felt the forecast was too gloomy,
  especially since it was drafted before a recent agreement
  between the leading Western economic powers to stabilise
  currencies around current levels.
      ""Many delegations feel the (Commission's) report is rather

  Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level
  trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are
  growing increasingly irritated with each other.
      The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the
  whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way
  for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day
  stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China.
      Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure,
  the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to
  reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.
      ""We appreciate their frustration,"" a senior Japanese
  government official said. ""But we are also frustrated.""
      The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last
  18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash
  spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad.
  That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade,
  but it will, he said.
      He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress
  that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that
  remain when it talks with Congress.
      ""It would only take five minutes to list their
  accomplishments,"" a senior U.S. Official replied.
      The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the
  economic structures of both countries and how they affect the
  bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48
  billion dlrs in Japan's favour.
      On the following two days, the topics will range from
  multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade
  problems as super computers.
      The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling
  discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include
  savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and
  housing, and the implications of government budget deficits.
      These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the
  Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic
  pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and
  stimulate the sagging economy by spending more.
      Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of
  boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.
      Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge
  U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade
  imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is
  buying more imports.
      Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft
  trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial
  trade practices. ""It condemns Japan without due process,"" one
  Japanese official said.
      That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out
  bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.
      Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's
  trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal
  access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade
  action by the U.S., Officials said.
      Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak
  bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill
  overhanging them.
      ""We have no leverage,"" one official admitted.
      As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints
  about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including
  super computers.
      The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese
  super computer market.
      The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to
  public institutions like universities which buy the
  sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up
  informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential
  sellers, officials said.

  Japanese microchip makers are being
  strong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on
  semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's
  market to foreign chips, industry analysts said.
      But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuring
  the firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether
  the U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any
  breathing space, they said.
      U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September
  have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese
  chipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said.
      ""MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry
  to get things done,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) associate
  vice president Peter Wolffe.
      Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the
  January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive
  chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject
  to the pact's price controls.
      The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide
  distributors with certificates designating them as authorised
  exporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey
  marketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said.
      U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in
  jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets
  and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan.
      But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the
  production cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp
  said it would cut production in line with MITI's request.
      ""NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI's
  demands,"" said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. ""Once
  NEC cuts production, it means they all have.""
      Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese
  firms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that
  the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact.
      ""The best way to lower cost is to produce more,"" said Salomon
  Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec.
      Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also
  spur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst Matt
  Aizawa said.
      Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new
  restrictions, some industry officials said.
      ""It's like tax avoidance schemes,"" said Steve Donovan, head
  of MMI Japan K.K. ""As soon as you close one route, another
  opens.""
      MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earlier
  shrugged off MITI guidance.
      ""It's getting to be like communism,"" said one.
      But analysts said output cuts could help by making it
  easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing
  firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss.
      ""They're going to have to start running their businesses
  like businesses,"" Bache's Wolffe said.
      MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign
  urging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industry
  officials said response has been mixed at best.
      ""There has been some change, but it's not across the board,""
  said one U.S. Spokesman. ""The companies have a varying degree of
  urgency.""
      The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the
  troubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added.
      Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamic
  random access memory) chips could merely speed the transition
  to one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said.
      Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory
  chips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, they
  said.
      Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S.
  Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the
  most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing.
      Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S.
  Commitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said.
      ""The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn't
  even have an office here,"" a source close to the industry said.
  ""You could question just how committed they are.""
      In addition, some industry analysts question the
  effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third
  country chipmakers such as those in South Korea.
      ""(South) Korea's gaining market share,"" said one analyst.
  ""They're the real winners from the agreement.""

      His plea, in an interview with Reuters and the television
  news agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will make

      King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared
  to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln
  barrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price
  agreed to by OPEC last December.

      Non-OPEC countries ""must help us in a framework of common

      Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first

  for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such
  issues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher
  benchmark.
      In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure,

  The European Community Commission said
  it has opened an enquiry into allegations that the Soviet Union
  is dumping mercury on the European market at below-cost prices.
      The Commission said its decision follows a complaint from
  EC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Soviet
  mercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in the
  European industry.
      According to the complaint, Soviet mercury sales in the EC
  had risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes between
  August and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of
  the EC market if they continue at the same pace.
      The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than
  40 pct below prices charged by EC producers, forcing them to
  cut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. The
  imports had caused producers heavy financial losses, it said.
      The Commission said the industry would probably be unable
  to hold prices at current levels and that any increase would
  result in loss of sales and jobs.
      The so-called anti-dumping procedure opened by the
  Commission will allow all interested parties to state their
  cases to the authority.

  China's foreign debt reached 27 billion
  dlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure to
  short-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains very
  creditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreign
  bankers and Chinese officials told Reuters.
      Foreign bankers said China's total debt rose sharply from
  an estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increased
  import commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low,
  between eight and 10 pct.
      China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said.
      Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relations
  and Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loan
  agreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on
  1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct.
      Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs in
  the 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers said
  they estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion.
      A Western banker said China's portfolio contains too much
  short-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as a
  result of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractive
  low interest rates in the Japanese market.
      The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and is
  likely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said.
      A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of the
  country's total debt at about 30 pct.
      The Peking representative of a Japanese securities house
  said the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares.
      ""Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China,
  which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to go
  elsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread,"" he
  said.
      The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans is
  in part a result of China's inexperience in the foreign capital
  markets, which it entered only in the early 1980s.
      ""Officials do not think of China but of their own department
  or firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have the
  full backing of the People's Republic of China,"" he said.
      ""The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in other
  areas, is to balance central control with giving reasonable
  autonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms to
  exercise indirect controls,"" he said.
      The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over the
  past six weeks that China's foreign borrowing will not be
  affected by a drive against ""bourgeois liberalism,"" a phrase
  meaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal of
  Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16.
      A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China's
  foreign exchange reserves have fallen below the officially
  stated figure of 10 billion dlrs.
      ""The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in the
  market, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily in
  advance of an announcement the reserves were down,"" he said.
      The banker said such buying has not been going on. ""Things
  are normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in
  1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development.""
      Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9
  billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985.
      A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade official
  said this year's outlook for exports, which account for more
  than 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthier
  than a year ago.
      The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. It
  was quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago.
      The official said China has taken measures to improve its
  export performance, including incentive offers to exporters and
  the establishment of export production bases.
      ""We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year,"" he
  added.
      Official estimates put China's 1986 export losses from the
  drop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs.
      A Western diplomat said China's foreign debt needs careful
  management but its debt service ratio remains very low at six
  to eight pct.
      ""We base our assessment not on China's foreign exchange
  reserves but on its export performance, just as you assess a
  company on its performance, not its bank account,"" he said.
      He said China performed very well in the export field last
  year and remains a very creditworthy country which will have
  few difficulties in increasing its borrowing.

  South Korea will further open its market
  to help cut its trade surplus with the U.S. And to fight off
  pressure to revalue the won against the dollar, a government
  spokesman said.
      The spokesman said Korean trade minister Rha Woong-Bae's
  stand in Washington yesterday against pressure from industrial
  nations to revalue the won underlined the government's
  determination to stand firm.
      Rha told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ""Demands that Korea
  carry out a drastic and sudden currency revaluation of five or
  10 pct are, I believe, extremely ill-advised.""
      Deputy prime minister Kim Mahn-Je told a meeting of local
  businessmen ""The government's policy on the question of
  revaluing the won is to maintain a steadfast position.""
      Kim said South Korea was ready to move slowly to raise the
  won's value because of its heavy foreign debt which stood at
  44.5 billion dlrs at the end of 1986.
      Six industrialised nations agreed in Paris last month that
  newly industrialising countries, such as South Korea and
  Taiwan, should allow their currencies to appreciate.
      But local businessmen have said won/dollar parity has
  already reached ""a crisis level.""
      An official of the Korea Traders' Association (KTA) said if
  the won strengthened another five pct, this would mean the loss
  of profitability for nearly half of all South Korean exporters.
      ""We are determined not to go the way of Latin American
  debtor nations which have suspended interest payments of their
  debts,"" the spokesman said. ""The only way to keep our good record
  is to maintain our exports.+
      The trade minister said yesterday should Seoul revalue the
  won suddenly Korea would run ""a tremendous trade deficit and
  could degenerate into a country, like many other developing
  countries, which is reneging on its international obligations.""
      The spokesman said South Korea had been gradually
  appreciating its currency, ruling out a major revaluation. So
  far this year, the won has gone up by 0.8 pct against the
  dollar after a 3.34 pct revaluation in 1986.
      He said South Korea was selecting ""many"" of 122 items on
  which Washington recently asked Seoul to lower tariffs to help
  narrow its trade surplus with the U.S. No further details were
  given.
      Seoul announced in January the lifting of bans on 158
  items, including sensitive agricultural products and large
  cars, effective from July.
      South Korea posted its first ever current account surplus
  last year, due largely to a trade surplus with the U.S. Of 7.1
  billion dlrs, against a 4.3 billion deficit in 1985. It earlier
  forecast that its current account surplus could reach eight
  billion dlrs this year.
      But the government official said the surplus would be held
  at around five billion dlrs to avoid further pressure by
  industrialised nations to push up the value of its currency.

      Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and

  too selective.
       Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6

  The oil services industry is on the

      The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some

  second half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the
  first half, and continue into the next decade.
       ""People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go
  up to start buying,"" said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research

  Halliburton Co &lt;HAL>, Dresser Industries &lt;DI>, Baker
  International &lt;BKO>, and McDermott International Inc &lt;MDR>,
  which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a
  Dallas-based investor.
      Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing
  exploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in
  oil services will begin in the U.S.
      ""Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up
  faster,"" said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs.
      The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766
  last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co

      The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is

  vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. ""The
  first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the
  second half of 1988,"" Kerridge said.
      Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar
  pattern, Kerridge said.
      ""Halliburton is the best value,"" said Jeffrey Freedman,

  the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common
  stock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess,
  and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash
  flow including debt.
      Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil service
  stock.
      ""Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant
  technical leader in the industry,"" Freedman said.
      ""Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring,
  including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its
  considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to
  maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on
  the project upturn in exploration and development activity,""

  OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed
  prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs.
      Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but
  fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more
  than the agreed level.
      ""The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would not
  hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of
  OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs,"" Lukman
  said.
      He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based
  on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, adding
  that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000
  bpd.
      Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement,
  while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab
  Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said.
      ""If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement
  succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level
  of 18 dlrs,"" the group's president said.
      He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting
  formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely.
      ""Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is
  at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in
  December are being adhered to,"" he said.
      Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow
  the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in
  relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied ""We consider
  the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials.""
      Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn
  on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well
  below this time last year and soon they would return to the
  market in search of crude.
      ""We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in
  maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,""
  Lukman said.
      The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he
  said had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise
  prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held
  view not to do anything to help the market.
      ""We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with
  two-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future is
  ours. We will use that advantage responsibly,"" he said.
      Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's output
  following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the
  South American country would be allowed a higher output quota
  when it recovered from the disaster.

  National Bank of Hungary first
  vice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct
  devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last
  year's severe trade deficit with the West.
      Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve at
  least equilibrium on its hard currency trade.
      ""It is useful to have a devaluation,"" he said. ""There is now a
  real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports.""
      The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would
  devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be
  announced later today. Fekete said the rates would come into
  effect tomorrow.
      He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had
  a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its
  main partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and
  5.5 pct in 1986).
      This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to
  prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of
  the 1970s, he added.
      Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by
  between three and four pct early last year.
      But the country's hard currency trade balance nevertheless
  fell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3
  mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985.
      Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade
  surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that a
  more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total
  hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs.
      One Western commercial attache here said: ""Devaluation of
  itself will not change anything. It will only be useful if they
  also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the
  quality of their export goods.""
      Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this
  year to invest in restructuring industry.
      It would be his role to persuade international banks to
  cooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given an
  AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai
  bond market.
      Hungary's net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion
  dlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of a
  current account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because
  the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt
  denominated in marks or yen.
      He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this
  year, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of
  modernisation.
      ""I am for credits to invest for that purpose,"" he said. ""I am
  against credits for consumption."" He forecast gross domestic
  product growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986.
     Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt
  profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term
  loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking
  more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where he
  considered rates to be low.
      Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at
  around 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, which
  tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after
  quadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry was
  working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for
  this year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion
  forints.

  Ecuador's deputy energy minister
  Fernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on
  further Venezuelan assistance to his country's oil industry
  following last week's earthquake, officials said.
      Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an
  expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of
  pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of
  Balao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports.
      Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend
  Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after
  180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs.
      The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports that
  Venezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador's entire OPEC quota,
  set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987.
      ""All options are open at this moment in the context of
  cooperation on oil production,"" a Venezuelan energy and mines
  ministry source said.
      Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to
  compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the
  pipeline is repaired, officials said.
      Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines
  minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks at
  technical level, officials said.
      Industry sources said that among the options are for
  Venezuela to produce Ecuador's entire quota, or for Venezuela
  and non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supply
  Ecuador's Far Eastern clients.
      But the ministry source said that no decision has yet been
  reached on the matter, and that an announcement would be made
  in due course.
      Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would have
  to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its
  needs until the line was repaired.
      Ecuador energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran
  said last night his country needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the
  damage to the export pipeline caused by the earthquake.

"training/3615";"International_Trade";"3";"U.S. TRADE DEFICIT 38.37 BILLION DLRS IN 4TH QTR
  The U.S. merchandise trade deficit
  on a balance of payments basis was a record 38.37 billion dlrs
  in the October to December fourth quarter, the Commerce
  Department said.
      The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15
  billion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previously
  reported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs.
      For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was a
  record 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985,
  the department said.
      During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78
  billion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs, while exports
  rose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs.
      The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes
  such factors as military sales and the costs of shipping and
  insurance.
      The Commerce Department said non-petroleum imports in the
  quarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion
  dlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose
  1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars
  from Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each.
      Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct
  because of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department
  said. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18
  pct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported cars
  and a nine pct decrease from Japan.
      On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs
  or nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct
  or 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports.
      Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because
  supplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were
  limited by drought.
      Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin America
  rose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs, with Japan increased 700
  mln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200
  mln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter.
      The deficit with newly industrialized Far East countries,
  including Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, fell
  500 mln dlrs to eight billion dlrs and with Canada the deficit
  decreased 200 mln dlrs to 3.3 billion dlrs in the quarter.
      In the full year 1986, imports rose 30.6 billion dlrs or
  nine pct to 369.5 billion dlrs. Exports increased by only 7.3
  billion dlrs or three pct to 221.8 billion dlrs.
      Commerce said petroleum imports during 1986 fell 16.6
  billion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lower
  prices. The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrs
  from 26.41 dlrs.
      Agricultural exports fell by 2.6 billion dlrs or nine pct
  to 26.9 billion during the year. The average price of rice fell
  27 pct, cotton was down 22 pct, corn 18 pct, wheat 16 pct and
  soybeans nine pct.
      The trade deficit with Japan for all of 1986 rose 11.1
  billion dlrs to 54.6 billion dlrs and with Western Europe
  increased 7.2 billion dlrs to 28.6 billion dlrs.

  Lured by the weakening dollar and the
  conviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, European
  energy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reserves
  to replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said.
      They said owning oil reserves in a politically stable
  United States is good insurance against future shortages.
  However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated up
  competition among European firms, well-heeled U.S.
  institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choice
  domestic oil properties.
      Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil and
  gas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyers
  had helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. All
  buyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs a
  barrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 for
  acquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and five
  dlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm's research.
      ""Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, but
  we're seeing new names and smaller companies coming in,"" said
  Arthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist and
  president of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn.
      ""Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil and
  gas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of the
  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,"" he added.
      Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believe
  the trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 because
  of the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception that
  oil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper to
  buy new reserves than to explore for them.
      Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks to
  the need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments and
  general restructuring throughout the oilpatch.
      In two of the biggest transactions of recent months,
  French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of &lt;Total Compagnie
  Francaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs to
  separately acquire oil assets of Texas International &lt;TEICC>
  and Lear Petroleum Partners &lt;LPP>. A spokesman for Minatome
  said the company is searching for additional acquisitions.
      A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, &lt;Petrofina S.A.>
  and &lt;Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buy
  virtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos &lt;WMB>,
  the Oklahoma pipeline firm.
      But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventures
  with experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan's
  &lt;Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc's &lt;TX> Texaco USA in a
  100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined with
  Dupont's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal.
      Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, its
  geographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil are
  more important factors in evaluating potential acquisitions
  than relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula.
      Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representing
  International Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of &lt;Preussag
  Corp> and &lt;C. Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm had
  earmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves in
  Texas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months.
      But he called that a small amount compared to the amount
  other investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebber's Geodyne
  Energy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend up
  to 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties.
      ""The competition is stiff, not only from other foreign
  investors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oil
  companies,"" he said. ""Our company is shopping around because we
  feel it's substantially less risky than pure exploration. If
  you're going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you need
  prices higher than the current market,"" he added.
      In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokerage
  houses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were also
  competing for prime properties.
      Houston-based Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group
  &lt;RD>, has been one of the most active companies in buying and
  selling reserves, Smith said. Since 1982, Shell has acquired
  two billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels of
  oil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said.
      ""Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of these
  companies,"" Smith said. ""Domestic production has dropped by one
  mln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it may
  drop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988.""

  With troops in place in Brazil's
  ports and oil installations, the government of Prersident Jose
  Sarney today sought to end a wave of labour unrest by a show of
  force.
      Yesterday the government sent thousands of troops supported
  in some instances by tanks to occupy nine oil refineries and
  six areas of oil production.
      The state-oil company Petrobras requested the intervention
  because of a threatened strike by 55,000 oil industry
  employees.
      The government had already dispatched more than 1,000
  marines to occupy the country's main ports after a national
  seamen's strike was ruled illegal last Friday.
      The strike by 40,000 seamen, now in its 13th day,
  represents a stern challenge to the government.
      The stoppage has delayed exports at a time when Brazil
  desperately needs foreign exchange.
      It was a deterioration in the country's trade balance which
  precipitated Brazil's current debt crisis and the decision on
  February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
  commercial debt.
      There was no sign today of an early end to the seamen's
  strike, which has badly hit the port of Santos -- the most
  important in South America -- and the country's other main
  ports.
      Small groups of marines armed with submachineguns stand on
  the quays near the strike-bound ships, but the military
  presence here is generally discreet.
      A total of 800 marines are inside the docks but most are
  out of sight.
      Yesterday marines and police occupied one ship, the
  Docemarte, seamen's leaders said. After explaining to the
  captain that the strikers faced up to one year in jail because
  the strike was illegal, the men returned to work.
      One of the strike leaders, Elmano Barbosa, said ""it is a
  psychological war. They are using force and we are using
  peaceful methods.""
      Port sources said only two Brazilian ships in Santos, the
  Docemarte and the Henrique Leal, were working.
      At the seamen's national strike headquarters in Rio de
  Janeiro, spokesmen say a total of about 190 ships are
  strike-bound in Brazil and in foreign ports.
      Contradicting earlier reports from strike headquarters in
  Rio de Janeiro, seamen in Santos said the strikers on board
  ships here were not running out of food.
      The current labour unrest is the worst faced by Sarney's
  civilian government since it came to power two years ago.
      Yesterday, in a separate protest, hundreds of thousands of
  farmers held rallies directed largely against high bank
  interest rates.
      The current rash of labour unrest in industry and
  agriculture stems from the failure of the government's
  now-collapsed Cruzado Plan price freeze.

      The cabinet authorized energy and mines minister arturo
  hernandez grisanti to approve the purchase in the shareholders
  assembly of the state oil company petroleos de venezuela
  (pdvsa).
      Pdvsa last april 14 signed a letter of intent to buy a half

  U.S. economic data this week could be
  the key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break
  out of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said.
      Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail
  sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy
  gains, figures within or slightly below expectations would be
  positive for the market, the analysts said.
      ""You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds
  right now,"" said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig
  Sloane.
      Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which
  traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a
  rise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interest
  to break below chart support in the June contract failed to
  materialize, participants who had sold bond futures early
  quickly covered short positions, they said.
      ""Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in
  as expected it won't be that bad for the market,"" Sloane said.
      Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector
  of retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct.
      Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure
  below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and
  she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up
  0.8 to 1.2 pct.
      Industrial production and the producer price index Friday
  both are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she
  added.
      Retail sales ""will tell us whether or not we will be able
  to fill the gap,"" Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June
  bonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bonds
  closed at 100-4/32 today.
      Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the
  federal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said
  Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer.
      ""A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the
  market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the
  market approached the top of the range,"" Singer said.
      In order for bonds to break above the top of the range,
  which is just below 102 in the June contract, ""the crude oil
  rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,""
  Singer said. ""Fed funds are already easing back down toward the
  six pct level.""
      The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to
  Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally
  may be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said.
      Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to
  ease to 99-6/32 and find support.
      ""I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet.
  The jury is still out this week,"" Rozich said.

  USX Corp said proved reserves of oil
  and natural gas liquids fell 28 pct to 802.8 mln barrels at the
  end of 1986 from 1.12 billion barrels at year-end 1985.
      The figures, in USX's just-released 1986 annual report,
  indicate much of the drop resulted from the exclusion of 293.7
  mln barrels of Libyan reserves, after the U.S. government last
  June directed U.S. oil companies to end Libyan operations.
      USX, which owns Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp,
  had 60 pct of its 1986 sales of 14.94 billion dlrs from its oil
  and gas operations.
      About 24 pct of total sales came from USX's USS steel unit
  and 16 pct from diversified businesses, which include oilfield
  services, raw materials, minerals, chemicals and real estate.
      According to the report, domestic liquids reserves fell
  slightly to 628.5 mln barrels from 628.9 mln and foreign
  reserves fell to 174.3 mln from 486.4 mln barrels. The large
  drop in foreign reserves was in the Middle East and Africa,
  where they fell to about 9.3 mln barrels from 316.7 mln,
  reflecting the exclusion of Libya.
      Total natural gas reserves fell to 4.82 trillion cubic feet
  at year-end 1986 from 5.18 trillion at the end of 1985.
      Again, most of the drop came from the Middle East and
  Africa, where reserves fell to zero from 71.9 billion cubic
  feet, excluding Libyan reserves.
      U.S. natural gas reserves fell to 3.44 trillion cubic feet
  from 3.65 trillion and foreign reserves fell to 1.38 trillion
  from 1.53 trillion.
      In other areas, USX said total capital spending fell to 962
  mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.78 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986
  audited figure is eight mln dlrs higher than the unaudited
  figure the company reported on Jan 27.
      USX also said it expects to record a gain of 150 mln dlrs
  in 1988, representing 50 pct of previously existing investment
  tax credits allowable under the new tax law. The loss of the
  other half of the credits was reflected in the fourth quarter.
      In a discussion of steel results, USX said plants that were
  shut down last month and some previously idled plants may be
  permanently closed. USX took a fourth quarter charge of 1.03
  billion dlrs to restructure its steel operations. The charge
  included the ""indefinite idling"" last month of four plants in
  Utah, Pennsylvania and Texas.
      Other plants or parts of plants in Pennsylvania, Indiana,
  Alabama, Ohio and Chicago had been previously idled.
      ""These operations are not permanently shut down. Improved
  market conditions for the products from these plants may make
  it feasible to reopen some of them,"" USX said in the report.
      ""On the other hand, a lack of any future market improvement
  may necessitate their permanent closing,"" it added.

  House trade lawmakers took their
  first votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but
  held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on
  controversial plans to protect American industries.
      Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Trade
  Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues
  in the bill--whether they will force major foreign trading
  partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United
  States.
      The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version of
  Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to open
  foreign markets but which drops last year's effort to force
  President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs.
      Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the
  lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will
  consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting
  specific trade penalties.
      The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and
  Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it.
      Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seeking
  his party's 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer an
  amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of
  those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods.
      This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to
  force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus
  with the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, West
  Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances.
      ""My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for
  getting the trade deficit down,"" he told reporters.
      The trade law changes are to become part of a major
  congressional and administration effort to turn around the
  record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by
  opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more
  competitive.
      House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said again
  today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by
  May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill.
      ""I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and Means
  Committee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effective
  bill,"" he told reporters.
      The comprehensive trade bill will include work by other
  committees to ease export controls on high technology, to aid
  U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulate
  research and development, to remove foreign trade barriers and
  to improve education and worker training.
      The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S.
  industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition
  if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining,
  safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the
  country's economic development.
      They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether to
  retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and
  whether an injured industry deserves import relief.
      They agreed to make it easier for a company to get
  temporary relief from import competition but agreed the
  industry should provide a plan to become competitive.
      The administration has not announced its support but
  Yeutter said yesterday, ""I am cautiously optimistic,"" that the
  Democratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill.

  Soviet first deputy prime minister
  Vsevolod Murakhovsky said at the end of a brief visit here his
  country wanted to boost joint business with France, but that a
  reduction of France's trade deficit with the Soviet Union
  depended on the French.
      Murakhovsky, who is also chairman of the State
  Agro-Industrial Committee (GOSAGROPROM), told a news conference
  he had discussed a variety of possible deals with French
  companies Rhone-Poulenc, Pechiney and Imec.
      Declining to put figures on possible contracts he said he
  had discussed plant protection and the processing of highly
  sulphuric gas with Rhone-Poulenc, packaging technology for
  agricultural products with Pechiney, and fruit and vegetable
  juice processing with Imec.
      An official for Pechiney said an agreement of intent on
  packaging could be signed soon, but could not give any other
  details. The other two companies were not immediately available
  for comment.
      Asked whether he foresaw a reduction this year of France's
  trade shortfall, at 7.6 billion francs in the first 11 months
  of 1986 against 5.1 billion for the whole of 1985, Murakhovsky
  told Reuters: ""It all depends on France.""
      At a meeting in Paris last January French and Soviet
  foreign trade ministers said they were committed to increased
  efforts to reduce the deficit. Estimates at the time showed a
  French 190 mln franc surplus for December 1986.
      Murakhovsky said the Soviet Union was prepared to talk with
  anybody with ""interesting"" proposals offering latest technology
  and assuring ""a mutual advantage.""
      He said the Soviet Union had many tasks ahead of it and
  would deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting.
      He encouraged companies to take advantage of new laws
  guaranteeing ""the interests of foreign partners"" in joint
  ventures.
      But he said no agreements had yet been finalised under the
  new joint venture laws.
      He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a
  result of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow last
  month with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng.
      He said Doumeng's Interagra company was preparing proposals
  for further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last month
  said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of
  goods.
      Murakhovsky said the agreement was one of intent, and
  designed primarily to renew and increase the Soviet Union's
  food production capacity.

  Ecuador will ask OPEC to raise its oil

  China has closed the second round of

  foreign firms for blocks in the Pearl River mouth and south
  Yellow Sea covering a total area of 44,913 sq km.
      Second round bidding began at the end of 1984 and only one
  well has so far produced results -- Lufeng 13-1-1, 250 km
  south-east of Shenzhen, with an output of 6,770 barrels a day.
  The well was drilled by a group of Japanese companies.

  The net inflow of foreign investment
  into Australia jumped to 7.3 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter
  of 1986 from 4.32 billion in the third quarter and 4.55 billion
  a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said.
      The Bureau attributed the increase to a turnaround of 2.08
  billion dlrs in official sector transactions and a 1.09 billion
  turnaround in direct investment.
      The turnaround in official transactions to a 1.52 billion
  inflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter, against a
  520 mln inflow a year earlier, was largely on account of
  government foreign currency borrowings, it said.
      Direct investment recorded a turnaround to a 1.04 billion
  dlr inflow in the fourth quarter from a 57 mln withdrawal in
  the third quarter, against a 546 mln inflow in the fourth
  quarter of 1985, the Bureau said.
      It said the major part of the turnaround reflected an
  injection of funds, estimated at around 700 mln dlrs,
  associated with the previously reported restructuring of the
  Australian operations of General Motors Corp &lt;GM>.
      GM used the funds to pay out or take over certain
  Australian liabilities of its local unit &lt;General

  inflow, accounting for 6.16 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter
  against 3.88 billion in the third quarter and 4.03 billion a
  year earlier, the Bureau said.
      Net official borrowings comprised 1.52 billion dlrs against
  a net outflow of 548 mln in the third quarter and a 516 mln

  Taiwan said it would soon relax import

      Taiwan announced the easing of import curbs on some 600

      He said the new move was intended to balance trade between
  Taiwan and its trading partners. The island's trade surplus

  10.62 billion in 1985.

  Taiwan's new controls on currency
  inflows, implemented today, are a desperate bid to stem a flood
  of speculative money prompted by the local currency surge
  against the U.S. Dollar, local and foreign bankers said.
      The central bank now has to clear remittances exceeding one
  mln U.S. Dlrs earned from exports, shipping and insurance and
  bank lending plus remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any
  other source.
      Petitioners have to show their remittances relate to
  genuine commercial transactions.
      Meanwhile, traders are no longer required to report all
  outward payments concerning invisible trade, including freight,
  insurance and royalties, to the central bank.
      But bankers said they believed the new controls would be
  ineffective since businessmen could split up remittances into
  smaller units or simply remit money through Taiwan's
  flourishing currency black market.
      The bankers said the controls, announced on March 6, are a
  panic reaction to U.S. Pressure, which has intensified over the
  past week, for a faster appreciation of the Taiwan dollar to
  slow the growth of Taiwan's exports to the U.S.
      The government has denied local press reports Washington is
  pressing for an exchange rate of up to 28 dlrs.
      The Taiwan dollar opened four cents up today at 34.70.
      ""I don't think the central bank has a final target,"" said an
  executive with a U.S. Bank. Other bankers and economists said
  they are wary of making any firm predictions about how far the
  Taiwan dollar will rise.
      Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. Hit 13.6 billion U.S.
  Dlrs last year against 10.2 billion in 1985. The surplus
  widened in the first two months of the year to 2.35 billion
  dlrs from 1.87 billion in the same period last year.
      Economists estimate up to five billion dlrs in speculative
  money flowed into Taiwan in 1986.
      This inflow helped boost foreign exchange reserves to more
  than 51 billion dlrs from just under 25 billion this time last
  year and provided further upward pressure on the currency.
      The Taiwan dollar has appreciated by almost 15 pct against
  the U.S. Currency since September 1985, further encouraging
  speculators.
      Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng said last week
  Washington's pressure plus rising foreign exchange reserves
  meant a further strengthening in the currency is inevitable.
      Many local bankers argue the only effective solution to the
  currency problem is to drop foreign exchange controls and allow
  the local dollar to find its own level.
      ""Lifting exchange controls is the final answer, but the
  central bank is not prepared to do it. It simply does not want
  to take the risk,"" said one local banker.
      He said he believed the new restrictions are a temporary
  measure designed to buy time as the central bank grapples with
  the exchange rate problem.
      The restrictions are a bureaucratic imposition and skirt
  around the real issue, he said.
      Taiwan needs a fundamental restructuring of foreign
  exchange controls, said an executive with a western bank.
      ""The controls will create more paperwork, but the extra bank
  charges will not outweigh the profits of speculation,"" said the
  manager of a European bank.
      Economists criticised the controls, saying they could
  antagonise Washington, which is pushing for further economic
  liberalisation in Taiwan.
      ""Instead of liberalising outflows, the government has
  restricted inflows,"" said Kate Newman, an economist with Vickers
  da Costa.
      A local banker, who declined to be named, said, ""It's
  basically ridiculous. It's a backward movement and goes against
  the government's liberalisation programme.""
      Taiwan last year eased some of its financial regulations to
  enable Taiwan nationals to invest in foreign government bonds,
  treasury bills and certificates of deposit and to allow
  individuals to take 5,000 U.S. Dlrs in cash out of the country
  each year.

  a vigorous recovery anytime soon. Japanese bank economists
  polled by Reuters said the economy's 18 month-old slowdown is
  likely to end in the first half of this year, helped by rising
  exports, stepped-up government spending and falling prices. ""The

      Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And
  West Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise
  currencies around current levels.
      The yen's 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two
  years has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing its
  companies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market.
      ""The important thing is the exchange rate,"" Taketomi said.
      If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise
  investment in plant and equipment, although there are no signs
  of that yet, economists said.
      A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their
  competitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting to
  recover, economists said.
      Domestically, the economy may get a boost from some
  loosening of the government's tight fiscal policy said Haruo
  Muto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.
      The next reading of the economy's health should come early
  next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter,
  1986.
      Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct from
  the previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct.
      But a senior government official said the fourth quarter
  figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point
  quarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statistical
  aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity.
      To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, the
  economy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourth
  quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong.
       The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a
  statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of
  1986, the official said.
      Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also
  distorted by the government's sale of gold coins in the second
  half of 1986.
      Because the coins were classified as legal tender, their
  purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer
  expenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in December
  because of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year
  bonuses, they said.
      As the government had to buy back some of the coins from
  retailers because they were unsold, the government's
  contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been
  boosted, economists said.
      Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from
  government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last
  year was good.
      The senior government official said the fourth quarter
  performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than
  generally expected, while that of the external sector was
  better.

  Most Japanese companies have decided not
  to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot
  prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels,
  industry sources said.
      They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai
  traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its
  official price of 17.42 dlrs.
      Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for
  Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said.
      The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a
  total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude
  under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in
  the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd.
      They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts
  on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts
  depended largely on the levels of spot prices.
      ""If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would
  probably buy Iranian crude at the official price,"" one Japanese
  refiner said.
      ""We don't intend to put pressure on them,"" he added.
      Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil
  at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are
  considerably lower, oil traders said.
      They said if spot prices move higher there will be no
  problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices.
  Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after
  finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is
  likely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus.
      The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from
  OPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to the
  fixed prices.
      But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to
  its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand
  would be balanced by the end of the second quarter.
      They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure
  based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations
  should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and
  a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend.
      One Japanese refiner said, ""At the moment there's a lot of
  pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out
  there will be no problem, and I'm beginning to trust their
  ability.""
      Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman
  told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, ""Nigeria and all
  member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the
  December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas
  and official selling prices.""
      He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks
  of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels
  well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon
  return to the market in search of crude.
      A Japanese refiner said, ""The European and U.S. Markets are
  beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky.""

  Phillips Petroleum Co will emphasize
  improving its short-term cash flow this year to pare its debt,
  C.J. ""Pete"" Silas, chairman, told Reuters in an interview.
      ""Our priority is to get cash flow increased from the assets
  already installed,"" he said, but he declined to estimate annual
  cash flow for 1987.
      Analysts estimate Phillips"" cash flow at over one billion
  dlrs for 1987, while long term debt, which resulted from
  restructuring to find off corporate raiders in 1985, hovers
  about 5.9 billion dlrs as of December 1986.
       Silas said Phillips hope to achieve its goal by raising
  the capital expenditures budget to develop its oil and gas
  properties.
      ""We plan to develop the properties with short-term high cash
  flow prospects,"" he said. He projected a capital expenditure
  budget of 730 mln dlrs, up from the 1986 expenditure of 655 mln
  dlrs.
      Nearly half of that will be spent on exploration and
  production, and most of that will be spend overseas, Silas
  said.
      ""Phillips' top priority in 1987 will be to get the
  waterflooding in Norway and jack up the (Ekofisk) oil fields to
  improve our ability to extract oil and increase earnings,"" Silas
  said.
       Phillips estimates that the project, which is expected to
  cost 1.5 billion dlrs, will increase recovery by 170 mln gross
  barrels of oil over a period of 24 years.
      Phillips is also pursue opportunities in China where Silas
  said he was seeking ""a modification of terms with the Chinese
  government to make oil discoveries (in the offshore Xijang
  fields) commercially viable.""
      In the U.S. Silas said Phillips hopes to get the Point
  Arguello, Calif., field started up by the fourth quarter. ""We
  expect to start up the first platform then,"" Silas said.
      But emphasis on short-term cash flow has also forced the
  company to part with several oil and gas assets.
      Phillips sold its interests in the T-Block in the U.K.
  North Sea and U.S. reserves totaling about 1.3 billion dlrs in
  1986 as part of a two billion dlrs asset sales program that is
  now completed, Silas said.
       ""We sold high cost producing assets. They were not good
  value for us but possibly so for someone else,"" Silas said.
      Silas said the 1986 assets sales will not affect earnings
  for the company.
      ""Everything we are doing is to manage our cash flow and we
  are using that to manage our debt. Even the asset sales, while
  regrettable, were necessary to reduce debt,"" Silas said.
      He said no asset sales are planned this year as long as oil
  prices don't fall sharply lower and stay at lower levels  for
  several months. ""Then, everyone would be looking at sales (of
  assets), and we're no different from the others,"" Silas said.
      In other areas, Silas looks for improved earnings from
  Phillips chemical operations, which provided 299 mln dlrs in
  earnings for 1986, up from 219 mln dlrs in 1985.
      ""This was our second best year pushed by a good supply and
  demand balance for products, low feedstocks and energy costs
  for our operations,"" Silas said, ""In 1987 we think the market's
  supply and demand balance will be just as good but feedstock
  and energy costs will rise due to price recovery.""

  Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen to
  its lowest level in more than a year, giving fresh evidence of
  the kingdom's determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a
  barrel, as agreed by Opec last December, oil industry sources
  said.
      They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March
  averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from the
  neutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February average
  of 3.5 mln bpd.
      They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude
  oil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must be
  counted towards a member's production quota. Saudi Arabia's
  quota is 4.133 mln bpd.
      The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, the
  world""s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opec
  official prices, even at the cost of lower production, the
  sources said.
      King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview with
  Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudi
  commitment to OPEC's December pact to boost oil prices to an
  average 18 dlrs.
      ""Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions,"" he
  said.
      The sources said the kingdom's exports from Gulf ports
  averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday,
  down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd.
      They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate
  with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain
  artificially high levels by putting oil into storage.
      The kingdom's main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms with
  past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon,
  Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the
  timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay
  official prices, the sources said.
      Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but
  still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed
  liftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said.
      They expected low early March output to pick up towards the
  end of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractual
  obligations.

  U.S. retail sales rose sharply in
  February but many economists said the underlying consumer
  spending trend remains weak.
      February retail sales jumped 4.1 pct, more than the 2.5-3.0
  pct rise the financial markets had anticipated. But January's
  sales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previously
  reported 5.8 pct decline.
      ""The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a
  much more sluggish pace,"" said Don Maude of Midland Montagu
  Capital Markets Inc.
      Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data
  over past four months to show that the pace of consumer
  spending is slowing.
      Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in November
  and a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gain
  over the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4
  pct rise for year-over-year sales through February.
      ""You can see a pattern developing,"" Maude said. ""I wouldn't
  be surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since sales
  probably won't be boosted by auto sales as they were in
  February.""
      Despite the weak underlying trend, economists were
  impressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding
  autos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct decline
  in January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline.
      ""The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gains
  in durable goods as well as non-durables,"" noted Ward McCarthy
  of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. ""It was a pretty healthy
  report.""
      He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in February
  after falling 1.7 pct in January. General merchandise store
  sales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in January.
      ""There are signs of life in the economy,"" McCarthy said.
  ""But it's jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report
  into the future."" 
      A 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in January
  which may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost
  spending in February, he said.
      ""A lot of people may be inadvertently under-withholding
  taxes from their paychecks,"" he said. ""When people in this
  country get an increase in disposable income, the inclination
  is to go out and spend it,"" he said.
      Economists said tomorrow's release of U.S. auto sales for
  the first 10 days of March will be an important indicator of
  how much this sector will add to first quarter spending.
       Auto sales accounted for the lion's share of total
  February sales, rising 14.4 pct. This followed a 27.7 pct drop
  in January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largely
  to the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws
  January 1, the Commerce Department noted.
      Some economists argued that the because the gain in total
  sales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, the
  strength in the February report is less than impressive.
      ""There is strength in the February data, but that's because
  they were compared to low sales levels in January,"" said said
  Beth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ""We don't see it as a
  precursor of continued strength.""
      Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling
  17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained
  1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January.
      Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February,
  following a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higher
  oil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales
  probably accounted for these gains.
      Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending
  is weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billion
  dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, they
  fell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and in
  February rose to 122.29 billion dlrs.
      ""On average, it looks like they'll total 120 to 121 mln
  dlrs in the first quartrer,"" she said. ""We don't look at this
  as indication that the economy is barrelling along.""
      ""The number is not really that problematic for those of us
  who are constructive on the bond market,"" agreed Elliot Platt
  of Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.
      Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary
  policy on the basis of the latest retail sales report.
      ""The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so
  confusing,"" he said.
      ""Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payroll
  employment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut in
  March,"" he said. ""But now Fed officials will have to wait for
  the first quarter real U.S. gross national product data in
  April to sort things out.""

      The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution

      One PDVSA official said the company was looking for

  The National Wildlife Federation 
  rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wilderness

      The federation, the nation's largest conservation group,
  said further study was needed to assess any possible damage
  that development might have on the wildlife in the area, the
  coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
      Jay Hair, the federation's executive vice president, called
  the Interior's research into the effects of development ""so
  fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on
  which to make a public policy decision.""
      Hair called the department's proposal a ""reflection of a
  largely political decision,"" adding ""we have no confidence in
  Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area.""
      Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain
  to oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough 
  safeguards to protect the area's caribou and musk-oxen.
      It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold
  billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as
  an energy resource would never be known without exploration.
      Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10
  billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain.
      Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas
  exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a
  wildlife refuge protected from commercial development.
      Hair said Interior's report failed to stress the
  probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct.
      He said Interior's study also failed to weigh oil, gas,
  fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered
  nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection
  Agency on the possible effects of exploration.
      The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a
  nine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the
  issue and report back to Congress in about two years.
      Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible
  exploration of oil, only that Interior's study was inadquate to
  make a sound judgement.
      Congressional observers said that at present there was
  little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for
  commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the

  over Solv-Ex's 25 pct working interest in the construction of
  the oil facility, relieving it of its obligation to raise about
  62.5 mln Canadian dlrs for plant construction.
      It said 30 pct of that loan was guaranteed by the
  Government of Alberta.
      In exchange for Shell's participation, Solv-Ex said Shell
  is obligated to pay it an up-front royalty and a running
  royalty based on the operating profits of the oil sands
  facility. It said the Shell Canada 7,500 barrel per day oil
  sands project will be built on Shell's oil sand lease about 40
  miles north of Fort McMurray in the Athabasca region of
  northern Alberta.
      Solv-Ex said the project will cost about 260 mln Canadian
  dlrs. It said that following a final feasibility study the
  plant should open in the early 1990s when oil prices are
  expected to exceed 20 U.S. dlrs per barrel.

      PDVSA and Union Pacific will each contribute half the
  capital required by the venture and arrange a revolving credit
  facility with U.S. and foreign banks to finance inventories and
  receivables, Union Pacific said.
      Petroles de Venezuela also signed a 25-year agreement to
  supply at least 140,000 bpd of Venezulean crude oil and naphtha
  to the refinery at market related prices.
      Under various options the in the agreement PDVSA could

  said.
     The statement said the agreement with PDVSA will enable the

  140-150,000 bpd, although total capacity is nearer 200,000 bpd.
      Several other Mediterranean refineries are currently

  Bolivia is to make a formal offer during
  the next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt from
  commercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct, central bank
  president Jier Nogales said.
       Nogales told Reuters in an interview the steering
  committee of Bolivia's creditor banks had agreed to consider
  the offer at a meeting in New York last month.
       He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivian
  paper on the international secondary debt market, where it now
  trades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value.
      Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy back
  its commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid the
  discounted rate in full.
      Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to
  30 years at interest rates below those fixed in the
  international markets, he added.
      Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loans
  to commercial banks since March, 1984, and Nogales said there
  would be no money available to restart traditional debt
  servicing to them for some time.
       Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes to
  cancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy-backs,
  but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make a
  formal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt at
  discounted rates.
      Nogales said practical and strategic considerations would
  determine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made in
  the next few months.
       He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks over
  the price to paid for the debt paper they hold, and would make
  a single non-negotiable offer.
      He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendly
  creditor countries, let alone commercial banks. The only
  traditional way forward was to capitalise interest, which would
  mean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater loss
  provisions, he added.
      ""We are confident that the banks are going to be
  reasonable,"" Nogales said. ""Now they can resolve their problems
  for once and for all.""
      ""The most conservative ones who want a little more will
  wait a year, but I don't know if the window of opportunity will
  be open all the time,"" he added.
      Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivia's four
  billion dlr foreign debt, 2.5 billion of which is owed to
  governments and the rest to international agencies, Nogales
  said negotiators had achieved considerable success in recent
  discussions with the Paris Club.
       He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to reschedule
  Bolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace, while
  accepting that interest would not be paid until 1989. Interest
  rates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under Paris
  Club rules, he added.
       He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregard
  penalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing with
  Argentina and Brazil, who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt.
      He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans from
  international agencies, and it expected to receive up to 400
  mln dlrs in disbursements this year.
      The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changed
  from a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow
  of 130 mln dlrs last year, he added.
      Nogales said that Bolivia's net international reserves now
  stood at around 250 mln dlrs, compared to one mln dlrs in
  disposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssoro
  took office in August, 1985.
      Nogales said inflation, which soared to over 20,000 pct a
  year in the government's first month in office, was now down to
  10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months, and the
  plan was that it should continue at this level.
      He said the government was also expecting at least three
  pct growth in gdp this year after several years of negative
  rates.

      The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means
  Committee next week, but major changes are not expected,

      ""This product could very well be toughening our trade policy
  and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this
  frightening word 'protectionism',"" Ways and Means chairman Dan
  Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said.
      The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific
  retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade
  practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year.
      But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee
  debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to
  mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by
  countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
      Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exact
  form of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the House
  approved his idea to force an annual ten pct trade surplus cut
  by those countries. 
      The trade bill will be wrapped in with legislation from
  other committees dealing with relaxation of export controls,
  incentives for research, expanded worker training and education
  and other efforts to increase U.S. competitiveness.
      The comprehensive trade bill is to be considered by the
  full House in late April and then will be considered by Senate
  committees.
      It requires President Reagan to retaliate against foreign
  unfair trade practices but do not mandate quotas or tariffs and
  allow an exemption if U.S. economic security would be harmed by
  U.S. actions against other countries.
      The bill would make it easier for U.S. industries to win
  relief from surges of imports of competitive products.
      It extends until January 1993, the administration's
  authority to negotiate trade agreements as part of the new
  round of multilateral talks under the General Agreements on

  Brazil's state-oil company,
  Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi
  Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees
  from the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said.
      Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the
  Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such
  conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of
  its commercial debts last month.
      The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oil
  consumption in Brazil.
      But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and
  decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras
  will lift the order to cancel the shipment.
      Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms by
  Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere.
      ""Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since
  1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much
  better for us, because with the market prices more or less the
  same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage,"" he said.
      Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing
  Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing
  from Brazil, he said.
      Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry
  workers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras
  oil stocks are ""reasonably balanced."" 
      Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, with
  an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000
  bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd.
      ""If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship, fine, I

      He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a

      Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline

  was put out of action.
      Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuador's
  is 210,000 bpd. Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to
  allow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the
  pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses.

      The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by

  Senior U.S. Economic officials
  disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget
  deficit reduction targets.
      Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic
  Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition to
  a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting
  spending and fostering economic growth.
      By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional
  Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the
  deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987.
      Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University
  that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the
  desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility
  for local projects to state governments.
      He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the
  President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to
  limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should
  be linked more closely.
      Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct
  growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and
  3.5 pct in 1988.
      Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of
  economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, ""It looks pretty
  good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports.""
      He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,
  ""It looks like they're on track.""
      While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,
  Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.
      The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax
  reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will
  greatly increase private production incentives, he said.
      ""Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest
  national net output of goods and services will permanently
  increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run
  consequences of tax reform,"" Sprinkel said. ""In 1986, this would
  have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the
  income of the average American family.""
      Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible
  for the large increase in the budget deficit.
      In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted
  to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of
  GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.
      Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986
  federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points
  higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.
      ""Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981
  tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget
  deficits of the past few years,"" Sprinkel said.
      ""This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax
  increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,"" he added.
      However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner
  argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.
      ""Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes
  enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the
  Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence
  spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit)
  are unpleasant,"" he said.
      Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological
  turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the ""biggest sustained inflation
  in our nation's history,"" which helped foster widespread
  distrust of government.
      ""The American people turned on the government with tax
  revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at
  the national level,"" Penner said.
      ""But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike
  of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake
  demands that the system change a lot.""
      Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget
  deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will
  remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.
      He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is
  not likely to succeed.
      ""I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to
  dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply
  because there's no ... Way to enforce it,"" Penner said.
      Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget
  deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated
  by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes
  related to tax reform and sales of government assets.
      ""Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative
  timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last
  day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved
  more than two billion dlrs,"" Penner said.

  the Federal Reserve Board said.
      The Fed previously said industrial production rose 0.4 pct
  in January.
      The Fed said the February gain was dominated by a sharp
  rise in motor vehicle production, which boosted output of both
  consumer goods and business equipment. Industrial production
  stood at 127.3 pct of the 1977 average in February and was up
  1.7 pct from a year ago, the Fed said.
      The Fed also revised the December industrial production
  figure to a gain of 0.5 pct from 0.3 pct originally reported.
      Manufacturing output rose 0.5 pct in February after a 0.1
  pct increase in January and included gains of 0.8 pct in
  durables and 0.1 pct in non-durables, the Fed said.
      Manufacturing was 2.4 pct above the year ago level.
      Production of auto assemblies rose to an annual rate of 8.3

      Output of consumer goods rose 0.6 pct after falling 0.3 pct
  in January and output of consumer durables was up 2.1 pct in
  February after falling by 2.0 pct in January.
      Business equipment production rose 1.0 pct in February,
  reflecting more output of autos and trucks for business use and
  a recovery from strikes in farm equipment industries, the Fed
  said.
      Mining output rose 0.1 pct after a 1.6 pct increase in
  January, but was still six pct lower than a year ago.
      Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after a 1.2 pct
  rise in January.
      Output of defense and space equipment was up 0.4 pct, the
  same as in January, and 6.2 pct higher than a year ago.
      Output of construction supplies rose 0.2 pct in February
  after a 1.5 pct January rise.
      Materials output increased by 0.2 pct last month, the
  fourth consecutive monthly increase after declining throughout
  much of 1986. The recent strength in materials has been
  concentrated in textiles, paper and chemicals, the Fed said.
      Output of home goods was up 0.3 pct in February and the Fed

  U.S. February reports reflecting slim
  gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures
  reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue
  to follow a stable course of monetary policy, economists said.
      ""If you're the Fed, there's no reason to do anything,"" said
  Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc.
      ""There are hints that GNP is picking up. On the inflation
  front, all is well,"" he said. ""Money supply is well under
  control. It's an absolutely ideal situation.""
      February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightly
  less than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected.
  This compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January's production
  number, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase.
      The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct,
  less than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise. This followed a 0.6 pct
  rise in the PPI in January.
      ""The Fed is going to look at this positively,"" said Allan
  Leslie of Discount Corporation. ""Certainly inflation is not as
  bad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately. Industrial
  production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants.""
      The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct in
  February, after a 9.8 pct increase in January.
      ""This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation
  is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per
  barrel,"" said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ""The
  trend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year.""
      In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pct
  decline in the PPI.
      Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected,
  but a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car prices
  fell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct.
      Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that
  a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both
  the financial markets and the Federal Reserve.
      ""The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations
  today,"" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International.
      While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier
  monetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise this
  could necessitate a weaker dollar.
      ""The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air,"" he
  said. ""We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete with
  foreign producers.""
      Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pct
  in February's PPI. With many electronic goods produced
  overseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raising
  prices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said.
      If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminish
  overseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which might
  necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices.
      By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8
  pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to
  a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value
  of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987.
      Slifer said import prices may rise further as
  manufacturers' contracts put in place before the dollar dropped
  to current levels expire, and new contracts are made that
  reflect a weaker dollar.
      David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported
  manufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the
  second half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S.
  industrial output.
      ""It's the other side of the lower dollar,"" Wyss said.
  ""Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive
  and they are increasing output.""
      Wyss said that the latest data point to an average
  industrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter.
  ""It's an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is
  beginning to revive.""
      But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not 
  convinced that the February reports portend economic gains. He
  said much of the strength came from factors that do not point
  to a sustained rise in industrial output.
      Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm
  equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in
  February business equipment production.
      Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2
  pct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy
  was produced, not that manufacturing activity gained.
      Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted for
  half of the industrial production gain as production of auto
  assemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5
  million units.
      ""In the first quarter, it looks like automakers are
  producing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling at
  roughly a seven mln unit rate,"" Roach said. ""The disparity
  between output and sales is showing up in inventories.""
      Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. business
  inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping
  demand in the first quarter of 1987.
      January business inventories rose 0.9 pct, the largest gain
  since July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct, the Commerce
  Department said. Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January, the
  largest monthly sales drop on record.
      Nonetheless, economists do not expect the Fed to react to
  month-to-month changes. ""The Fed has been standing pat for the
  last seven months,"" Ramirez said. ""They will continue to stand
  pat for at least the next couple of months.""

  Mobil Corp chairman Allen E. Murray

      ""Overall capital and exploration expenditures will fall
  slightly below the level for 1986 although we'll be ready to
  increase spending whenever the outlook becomes more promising,""
  Murray said.
      Mobil data in the annual report shows capital expenditures
  have been cut every year since 1984's 3.6 billion dlrs to 3.5
  billion dlrs in 1985.
      Murray told shareholders that despite the cuts ""the company
  has promising acreage to explore as well as major oil and gas
  reserves to develop in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Africa and
  Indonesia.
      Over the past two weeks Mobil has announced restructuring
  of its domestic exploration and development organization and
  this week a restructuring of its oil services units, which
  support the new affiliate.
      ""Mobil's chairman has explained this change by saying we
  need a leaner organization to get more efficient usage from our
  assets,"" said John Lord, a Mobil Corp spokesman.
      Murray said in announcing the first reorganization, which
  will combine its current three exploration and producing
  affiliates into one organization, Mobil Exploration and
  Production U.S. Inc, that it is more effective than the present
  organization and will improve the company's upstream
  competitive position.
      Yesterday the company said that it will restructure its
  Mobil Exploration and Producing Services Inc, MEPSI, to enhance
  the development and transfer of technology supporting critical
  areas of exploration, drilling, resevoir management and
  computer systems.
      Earnings from Mobil's upstream operations in 1986 were 827
  mln dlrs, down 54 pct from the previous year's 1.8 billion dlrs
  in earnings.
      Mobil's strategy in the exploration and production sector
  will be to give most attention to exploration possibilities
  with the greatest long term potential, the company said.
      In its annual report, Mobil said that this will include
  greater emphasis on ""frontier plays that, although riskier, fit
  our strengths of technology and size...This probably also means

  Brazil's labour troubles eased a
  little today as the authorities announced they were withdrawing
  troops from the country's main oil installations occupied three
  days ago.
      The troops went in at the request of the state-oil company
  Petrobras because of the threat of a strike by 55,000 oil
  industry employees.
      Petrobras said in a statement today it had requested the
  withdrawal of the troops. The situation in the refineries was
  calm, it said, and the employees had indicated their
  willingness to negotiate a pay deal.
      A national seamen's strike, however, continued and marines
  remained in the country's main ports. The marines were
  despatched to the ports after the seamen's strike, now two
  weeks old, was ruled illegal last Friday.
      A spokesman at the national strike headquarters in Rio de
  Janeiro said today a total of l63 ships were strike-bound, 135
  in Brazil and 28 in foreign ports.
      Yesterday two small companies specialised in the transport
  of chemicals, Global and Flumar, struck a pay accord with their
  seamen who have secured a 120 pct increase.
      Brazilian newspapers today hailed these agreements as a
  sign that the national strike could soon come to an end.
      Both companies employ fewer than 200 seamen and union
  leaders said the vast majority of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were
  still on strike.
      The threat of a stoppage by oil industry employees appeared
  today to be receding. Petrobras said in its statement that the
  company would meet union leaders for pay talks in Rio de
  Janeiro next Wednesday.
      Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto would act as a mediator.
      Besides industrial troubles, there has also been
  considerable unrest this week in the agricultural sector.
      On Tuesday hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies
  throughout the country to protest against high interest rates.
      Television reports showed some of these protests still
  continuing today, with farmers blockading banks with their
  vehicles in several towns in the states of Sao Paulo and
  Parana.
      The strikes in Brazil come as the government is trying to
  extricate itself from a serious debt crisis brought on by a
  deterioration in its trade balance.
      On February 20 President Jose Sarney announced that Brazil
  was suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt to
  private banks.
      Because of the seamen strike exports are being delayed and
  the country is losing badly needed foreign exchange.

  The House Ways and Means Committee
  is moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said was
  intended to help open foreign markets to U.S. agricultural
  goods and to modify some U.S. agricultural trade laws.
      The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan to
  take into account the potential harm to U.S. agricultural
  exports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreign
  unfair trade practices against other domestic industries.
      The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seek
  government monitoring of imports if there is a reasonable
  chance the industry would be harmed by an import surge.
      The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the bill
  next week and congressional sources said they expect it will be
  approved.
       In investigations involving a processed agricultural
  product, trade associations of processors or producers would
  have to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfair
  duties.
       The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives for
  the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on
  Tariffs and Trade. It would seek fair trade in agriculture,
  seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and
  export practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas and
  non-tariff barriers.
       President Reagan's authority to negotiate a new GATT
  agreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority
  to negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended
  through January 3, 1991.
      The bill extends Reagan's authority to negotiate an
  international coffee agreement through October 31, 1989.
      It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugar
  imported from November 1, 1977 to March 31, 1985 for production
  of sugar or products containing sugar and destined for
  re-export. The export of the sugar or products must occur
  before Octoer 1, 1991.
      Presently, to qualify for the refund the sugar must be
  processed within three years after import and exported within
  five years.
      Agriculture would also benefit from more rapid decisions in
  complaints of unfair foreign trade practices or injury from
  imports.

  Venezuela will lend Ecuador up to 12.5

  Minister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement.
      Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline
  connecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port of
  Balao was damaged last week by an earthquake.
      Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for a

  and provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador, he said.
       Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed its
  exports after repairing its pipeline to Balao, a task that
  would take an estimated five  months.
      Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude for

  repay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired.
      Both countries are the only Latin American members of the

      Under the deal Petro Chemie supplies oil to Ina refineries
  in Sisak and Rijeka and ships parts to 12 Yugoslav firms in the
  petrochemical, chemical, textile and plastics industries. The
  Yugoslav firms, in turn, will export oil products to France.

"training/5167";"Energy_Resources";"2";"SAUDI OIL MINISTER SEES NO NEED TO ALTER OPEC PACT
  Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
  said OPEC's December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18
  dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there
  was no immediate need to change it.
      Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news
  agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three
  mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC
  quota.
      Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will
  continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members
  adhere to the pact, Nazer said.
      The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production
  ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices
  averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.
      Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki
  Yamani last October, said: ""I do not foresee any need for new
  measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting
  will take place as scheduled.""
      Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all
  members were abiding by its agreements.
      ""We've heard news every now and then of violations but they
  were not at all verified,"" he said.
      OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a
  13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near
  18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.
      Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but
  have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as
  traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.
      Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its
  4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.
      ""As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as
  devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to
  the agreement,"" he said.
      Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the
  Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating
  storage, Nazer said.
      King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and
  Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price
  stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful
  competition with OPEC.
      ""Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly
  desires price stability,"" he said.
      Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had
  returned to a role of ""swing producer"" within OPEC.
      Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln
  bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and
  over-production by some OPEC states.
      ""Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played
  by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8
  mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other
  members of OPEC,"" Nazer said.
      Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third
  quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.
      But he said if circumstances changed ""I am sure then the
  OPEC members will consult with each other and take the
  necessary measures.""
      Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when
  demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern
  hemisphere spring and summer.
      Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation
  from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union
  agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after
  he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.
      ""We did not ask any country to do anything. These were
  programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market
  conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing
  conditions,"" Nazer said.
      He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate
  -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if
  they saw fit.

  Tense trade relations with the U.S.
  And Japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposed
  European Community (EC) tax on edible oils and fats are
  expected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers here
  tomorrow.
      EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on the
  EC Executive Commission's proposal to impose a hefty tax on
  domestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off a
  proposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations.
      The proposal was the most controversial part of a reform
  package, due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later this
  month, of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen as
  the root cause of the EC's persistent financial problems and of
  tensions with major trading partners.
      The proposal is described by its promoters as a
  stabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going
  into massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut
  cereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forward
  tax.
      They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats
  production and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by
  a fall in EC output, but would also save the EC some two
  billion European Currency Units, over two billion dlrs, in farm
  costs.
      It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as
  well as foreign exporters, led by the United States.
      The diplomats said the protests had been received from most
  corners of the developing and developed world, ranging from
  Senegal, Malaysia and Indonesia, to Brazil, Argentina, Canada,
  Iceland and Norway.
      The proposal had little chance of approval by EC
  governments, with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as
  Britain, and Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal also
  unconvinced of its political or economic wisdom.
      Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France and
  Greece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did not
  seem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to
  the list of products affected.
      But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U.S.
  And elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promote
  anti-EC action, and the foreign ministers' debate should
  demonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal within
  the EC and deprive its oponents of this argument.
      The ministers were also due to discuss proposals in the
  U.S. Congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as a
  bill that would curb EC textile exports.
      The diplomats said the ministers were expected to strongly
  back a Commission warning to Washington that such a bill, if
  enacted, would provoke swift EC retaliation.

  Saudi Arabian business
  leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out
  problems facing the private sector of the kingdom's
  oil-dependent economy.
      The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi
  Arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and
  commerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices.
      The four-day conference in this resort town, high in the
  mountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea,
  has been organised by Saudi Arabia's chambers of commerce.
      Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce
  Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day.
      Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air
  problems facing commerce and industry after last year's slide
  in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in
  a private sector sorely short of finance.
      Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia,
  the world's largest crude exporter, needs to foster private
  enterprise to diversify its oil-based economy.
      The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle
  East recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing
  and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans.
      Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord
  reached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost
  prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel.
      With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at the
  turn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a
  52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down
  foreign reserves.
      The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of
  confidence to the business community.
      Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last
  November, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the
  number of new non-performing loans.
      But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporate
  finance manager in Riyadh said: ""Banks are still reluctant to
  lend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I am
  not sure if it is firmly based.""
      Some businessmen and bankers point out that government
  spending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy
  may still be contracting.
      Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply.
  A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the

  The Soviet economy recovered slightly
  last month after a poor performance in January, but major
  industries, including oil and machinery, are still short of
  production targets, official figures show.
      Central Statistical Board data published in the weekly
  Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta yesterday showed that industrial output
  was only up 0.8 pct in the first two months of 1987 over the
  same period of last year.
      However, the figure for January alone showed a fall in
  output of 0.1 pct from a year earlier. Production is targetted
  to increase 4.4 pct for all of 1987.
      The figures showed that only 77 pct of enterprises met
  their supply obligations in January and February.
      Production of oil, the country's main export to Western
  nations, hit 100 mln tonnes in January and February, up from
  97.3 mln a year earlier, and exceeded its target by 0.5 pct.
      Economists said this reflected the huge investments poured
  into the oil sector in recent months in an effort to reverse
  the stagnation in production which began in November 1983.
      Falling world oil prices last year helped cause a decline
  in Soviet trade with the West to 130 billion roubles from 141.6
  billion in 1985.
      Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta said labour productivity targets
  were also not fulfilled, but did not give figures.
      Economists said the overall data reflected exceptionally
  bad weather at the start of the year and stricter quality
  controls imposed on enterprises.
      Production in the machine-building sector, a priority in
  Moscow's plans for economic renewal, recovered slightly in
  February but was still 3.6 pct lower in the first two months of
  the year compared with the same period of 1986.
      The figures showed that five republics produced less than
  in the first two months of 1986.

  Peru will put into effect Monday a foreign
  exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide
  in the country's international reserves, a government decree in
  the Official Gazette said.
      Under the system, importers will be required to present a
  bill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a license
  for foreign exchange. The central bank will have 10 days to
  decide whether to issue the required foreign exchange.
      Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs
  compared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago.
      The system will be effective until the end of 1988.
      A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by
  a council with members from the central bank, the economy
  ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes. The
  central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in
  accordance with guidelines set by the council.
      Peru's reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade
  surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in
  1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates.
     Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against
  2.97 billion in 1985.
     Imports last year rose sharply as gross domestic product
  grew by about 8.5 pct, the highest economic growth level
  registered in 12 years. Imports were about 2.49 billion dlrs in
  1986 against 1.87 billion in 1985, according to preliminary
  estimates.
      The cushion of reserves allowed Peru to take a hard-line
  debt stance last year and suspend most payments due on its 14.3
  billion dlr foreign debt.

  Australia's current account deficit for
  February is expected to narrow to a range of between 700 mln
  and one billion dlrs, from the unrevised January level of 1.29
  billion, market economists polled by Reuters said.
      Statistics Bureau February figures are out tomorrow.
      The economists said a key element in the narrowing would be
  a reversal of the drop in exports which took place in January,
  after a sharp rise in December when the deficit was only 598
  mln dlrs.
      As an example they quoted wheat export volume, which rose
  about 30 pct in February after dropping as much in January.
      A lack of aircraft imports in February should also
  contribute on the trade account although it is still likely to
  remain in deficit, the economists said.
      Other positive influences on the current account balance
  should be a decline in the invisibles deficit following a
  seasonal fall in interest payments and the dropping out of
  certain official aid payments, they said.
      They said the Australian dollar, which last week touched an
  eight-month high of 0.6900 U.S. Dlrs but is now around the
  0.6800 level, should not react adversely to the figures unless
  the current account shortfall tops one billion dlrs.

  The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the
  yen around its current range, a senior central bank official
  told reporters.
      He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris
  last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current
  ranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar
  rise.
      Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency
  stability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other
  policies and with other central banks, he said.
      The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability
  will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but
  declined to be more specific.
      Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday
  the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily
  satisfactory for the Japanese economy.
      Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the
  official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a
  completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S.
  Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by government
  officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down.
      The senior bank official said he expects Japan's gross
  national product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in
  the fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little
  changed from the performance expected this year.
      Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but
  the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of
  nearly one percentage point, he said.
      He said there was virtually no room for further monetary
  policy action to boost the economy. The economy's performance
  in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added.
      The central bank's monetary policy has already done its
  part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said.
  The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the
  last year and a half.
      Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of
  inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said.
  ""We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may
  still be wet,"" he added.
      Liquidity among private households and especially the
  corporate sector has increased substantially, he said.
      The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock
  exchange prices, the bank official said. This inflow of funds
  into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may
  continue, he said.
      The senior official said the Bank of Japan is hoping
  Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker will be re-appointed when
  his current term expires later this year.
      ""He's a great man,"" the official said, adding that more and
  more people expect his reappointment.
      Turning to exchange rates, the official said the
  substantial drop in the dollar is beginning to have an effect
  on reducing the imbalance in world trade, even though the
  impact has taken longer than expected to show through. Even the
  U.S. Trade position has begun to feel the impact, although so
  far it has not been very strong, he said.

  OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd of

  ceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and
  Ecuador, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated.
      A landslide breached Iraq's one mln bpd pipeline through
  Turkey on March 6 for a week, and earthquakes in Ecuador have
  shut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuador
  has an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd.

  week of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second, in addition to
  output from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
      MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of
  its total production into floating storage.
      Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the
  television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output,
  including Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd.
      The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan
  oil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared with
  its 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lower
  than that.
      It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially
  stopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for March
  because Libya was insisting on official prices, but is still
  lifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a
  further 25,000 bpd of ""purchase crude.""
      It said small equity producers, with entitlements of only
  2,000 to 3,000 bpd, had also told Tripoli they could not lift
  at official prices.
      MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member
  countries calling for the formation of a committee to study
  what it said were inequalities in marketing potential among
  various members.
      The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was

  Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make

  to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments.
      Ecuador said on Friday that last week's earthquake was
  forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the
  slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to
  private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16
  billion dlr foreign debt.
      ""All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour,"" the

      He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17

  a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.

  Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220

      But the French bank's plan, which would effectively
  postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several
  months, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52
  members of the loan syndicate.
      The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports was
  ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months
  to repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair.
      President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total
  damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that
  Ecuador as a result would maintain January's suspension of
  interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt.
      Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the
  price of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador's
  export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue.
      Although sympathetic to Ecuador's plight, many banks in the
  Paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job
  for international financial organizations and not for
  commercial banks, bankers said.
      The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last
  October 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a

      Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel strongly
  that the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, they
  fear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions
  for Latin borrowers will be set back.
      ""There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feel
  it's a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of a
  restructuring would look bad,"" one banker commented.

  Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by government
  officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down.
      The senior bank official said he expects Japan's gross
  national product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in
  the fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little
  changed from the performance expected this year.
      Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but
  the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of
  nearly one percentage point, he said.
      He said there was virtually no room for further monetary
  policy action to boost the economy. The economy's performance
  in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added.
      The central bank's monetary policy has already done its
  part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said.
  The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the
  last year and a half.
      Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of
  inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said.
  ""We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may
  still be wet,"" he added.
      Liquidity among private households and especially the
  corporate sector has increased substantially, he said.
      The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock
  exchange prices, the bank official said. This inflow of funds
  into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may
  continue, he said.

  Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
  said OPEC's December agreement to stabilize oil prices at 18
  dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there
  was no immediate need to change it.
      Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news
  agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three
  mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC
  quota.
      Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will
  continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members
  adhere to the pact, Nazer said.
      The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production
  ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices
  averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.
      Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki
  Yamani last October, said: ""I do not foresee any need for new
  measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting
  will take place as scheduled.""
      Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all
  members were abiding by its agreements.
      ""We've heard news every now and then of violations but they
  were not at all verified,"" he said.
      OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a
  13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near
  18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.
      Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but
  have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as
  traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.
      Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its
  4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.
      ""As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as
  devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to
  the agreement,"" he said.
      Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the
  Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating
  storage, Nazer said.
      King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and
  Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price
  stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful
  competition with OPEC.
      ""Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly
  desires price stability,"" he said.
      Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had
  returned to a role of ""swing producer"" within OPEC.
      Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln
  bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and
  over-production by some OPEC states.
      ""Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played
  by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8
  mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other
  members of OPEC,"" Nazer said.
      Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third
  quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.
      But he said if circumstances changed ""I am sure then the
  OPEC members will consult with each other and take the
  necessary measures.""
      Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when
  demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern
  hemisphere spring and summer.
      Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation
  from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union
  agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after
  he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.
      ""We did not ask any country to do anything. These were
  programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market
  conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing
  conditions,"" Nazer said.
      He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate
  -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if
  they saw fit.

  Egypt and the Soviet Union are expected
  to sign an agreement in Moscow next week settling Cairo's three
  billion dlr military debt, Egyptian officials said.
      One official, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters a
  draft agreement would reduce to zero from two pct future
  interest payable on the 10 year-old debt, and set a 25 year
  repayment term.
      Talks are due to begin in Moscow on Wednesday.
      Economy Minister Youssri Mustapha, who leaves for Moscow on
  Tuesday, met President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ambassador to
  Moscow Salah Bassiouni to discuss the issue.
      One official said Egypt would propose a new exchange rate
  for trade with the Soviet Union. Current commerce is based on a
  rate set in the 1960s of 0.38 Egyptian pounds to the dollar
  which Moscow sees as unreasonable. The fluctuating official
  rate is about 1.36 pounds to the dollar.
      The officials said part of the debt would be paid in
  exports of goods such as textiles, leather and furniture.
      Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open the
  door for new cooperation, mainly in modernising Soviet-built
  steel, aluminium and fertiliser plants under a five-year
  development plan ending June 30 1992.
      Egypt, which already imports Soviet coal, wood, newsprint
  and glass, also wanted a debt deal to allow purchases of
  currently blocked spare parts for its ageing Soviet military
  hardware, the officials said.
      An estimated 65 pct of Egypt's arsenal is still made up of
  Soviet-supplied equipment, one official said.
      Cairo stopped repaying Moscow for arms purchases in 1977
  when then-president Anwar Sadat broke with its long-standing

      Siew returned from Washington on Friday after the U.S

  Britain and West Germany told their
  European Community partners they would strongly oppose major
  elements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses.
      At a meeting of EC foreign ministers, Britain called for a
  full debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that has
  already angered EC consumer groups and unleashed Washington-led
  protests from exporters to the EC, diplomats said.
      West Germany, also opposed to the oils and fats tax, will
  advise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenance
  other proposals that could hit German farmers, they added.
      They said West Germany's objections were put in a letter
  this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors, the
  president of the EC's Executive Commission which had put
  forward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new EC
  cash crisis.
      Kohl reiterated German objections to proposed cereals
  production curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for a
  proposed dismantling of Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) -
  a system of cross-border subsidies and taxes which level out
  foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports.
      Kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit German
  farmers who, without MCAs, would find it much more difficult to
  export to weaker currency states, which means virtually all
  other 11 EC states, diplomats said.
      Britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to impose
  a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because it
  could seriously damage EC trade relations.
      The diplomats said the United States had been the most
  outspoken among foreign critics of the proposal, describing it
  as a breach of the EC's obligations under the world trade body
  GATT.
      But protests had also come from other exporters to the EC,
  such as Senegal, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina,
  Iceland and Norway, they added.
      Britain has often lined up against West Germany on the farm
  reform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures that
  could spark a damaging trade war with the U.S.
      Foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision on
  either the oils and fats tax or the MCA proposals today,
  diplomats said. But their discussion should make clear that
  neither has a chance of surviving when it comes up for
  substantive consideration by EC farm ministers later this
  month, they added.

  A year after squeezing to power with a
  narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques
  Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations
  choking the French economy.
      But France is still waiting for a promised industrial
  recovery the government says will follow from its free market
  policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But
  so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year
  and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct
  in 1986, is uncertain.
      Forced last month to cut the government's 1987 growth
  target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister
  Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But
  some government supporters say they fear time for an economic
  miracle may be running out.
      The political clock is ticking towards Presidential
  elections due by April next year.
      France's economic performance, led by a mixed cast of
  right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed
  reviews from non-partisan analysts.
      For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at
  newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government's outstanding
  achievement has been to launch ""a veritable intellectual
  revolution"" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of
  state control.
      ""The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad --
  but set in their context of structural reforms, they are
  excellent,"" Develle said.
      But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief
  architect of the government's free market policies, may be
  pursuing a mirage.
      ""The belief that economic liberalism will produce an
  explosion of economic forces is ideological"" said Indosuez chief
  economist Jean Cheval. ""Personally I think it's an illusion.
  Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system,
  from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible.""
      Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard.
  Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls
  have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been
  pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely
  popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks
  and industries to private investors.
      Since December, nearly five mln French investors have
  bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA> and glass
  maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA &lt;SGEP.PA>, the first two state
  companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion
  franc five-year privatisation plan.
      Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of
  capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has
  flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift
  the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since
  December.
      At the end of last year the government abolished price
  controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car
  repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small
  businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy.
      The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices
  in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the
  official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or
  less.
      ""But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you
  consider that prices are now free for the first time since
  1945,"" commented Develle of Paribas.
      Other achievements include a major reduction in the state's
  foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1
  billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and
  down from 153.3 billion in 1985.
      But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a
  gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French
  franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating
  three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second
  since Chirac took power.
      A recent report by the Organisation for Economic
  Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for
  failing to produce the goods that its potential customers
  wanted.
      Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology
  sectors, French industrial goods were ""increasingly ill-adapted
  to demand"" and over-priced, the report said.
      French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed
  with the report. ""One of the assumptions of the government is
  that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and
  modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like
  freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go,"" he said.
      And despite rising industrial investment and the
  introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment,
  the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7
  million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier.
      The problem for the government is that there may be little
  more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth.
      French producers failed more than most to take advantage of
  last year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the
  shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like
  West Germany and Japan, they say.

  U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a
  showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major
  trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the
  full House of Representatives in late April.
      In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key
  House subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of
  legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against
  foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices.
      This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts
  to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn
  around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.
      Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too
  many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back
  amendments to ""get tough"" with countries that violate trade
  agreements or keep out U.S. products.
       On the other hand, congressmen known for their allegiance
  to free trade, said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in
  trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating
  powers.
      Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee's
  bill was not one ""that a free trader like me could endorse in
  all respects,"" but he emphasized there was a consensus among
  trade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans
  would ultimately endorse.
      Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was, ""to make our
  trade policy stronger without violating our international trade
  agreements. You'll find a lot of people who think we have not
  done the former enough. You'll find poeple who think we haven't
  avoided violating agreements.""
      In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful
  chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the trade
  subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced
  Reagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports
  from countries that engage in unfair trade practices.
      It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would
  hurt the U.S. economy.
      Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois
  Democrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if
  the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law.
      Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a
  tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this
  year only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he
  saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill.
      As an indication of his success, White House spokesman
  Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still
  did not like some provisions. But he added, ""Generally we feel
  very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade
  legislation. I think we are progressing very well.""
      The first battle will take place next week when the full
  House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.
  Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries such
  as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses
  with the United States.
      The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only
  that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United
  States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,
  but would not automatically set off retaliation.
      Rep. Phil Crane, an Illinois Republican and staunch free
  trader, said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan.
      Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from
  imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.
  AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the
  administration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan would
  sign would not be worth passage in Congress.
      But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in a
  statement, ""I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane
  Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed
  by the president.""
      In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for
  trade relief for specific industries such as textiles.
      Rep. Ed Jenkins, a Democrat from Georgia, agreed to hold
  off his fight. He intends to push separately a bill to protect
  the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan
  vetoed a similar measure last year.
      House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, is one of the
  most influential proponents of aid for specific industries
  beset by low priced foreign competition.
      Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for the
  domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate
  plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports
  reach half of domestic consumption.
      For the most part, the trade bill's provisions toughen U.S.
  enforcement of trade laws. The bill forces the administration
  to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as
  dumping products in the United States at prices below the cost
  of production.
      It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an
  industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its
  existence. Congressmen said the change would have required the
  U.S. International Trade Commission to impose limits on car
  imports in 1981.

      The company said the lower rate results from a reduction in
  the average price the pipeline is paying for gas, adding this
  reflects contract reformation agreemats with producers.

  Norway's parliament has approved an
  extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a
  key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on
  Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said.
      The unilateral boycott, proposed by Norway's minority
  Labour government, gives domestic companies until late
  September to cut remaining trade ties with South Africa and
  Namibia.
      ""The legislation discussed today must not be seen as an
  isolated measure, but as a step in an international process,""
  Norway's foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg told parliament.
      Government officials said they hope the move will intensify
  international pressure against the Pretoria regime's apartheid
  policies. Sweden, in a similar move last week, promised to halt
  all trade with South Africa by October.
      Norway's boycott, although forbidding crude oil shipments
  to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, makes an important
  exception for ships whose final destination is decided while
  they are at sea.
      Oil cargoes are often resold by trades after loading,
  making it difficult for shipowners to know their ships' final
  port at the start of a voyage.
      Critics said the bill leaves the door open for continued
  oil shipments to South Africa. They called for stricter
  sanctions to stop all Norwegian shipping to South Africa.
      Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct
  of its crude imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has
  dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months,
  trade ministry officials said.
      The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South
  Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight
  months of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns
  from the year-ago figure.
      ""Many would say that the law has already had its effect
  because of the dramatic drop in trade between South African and
  Norway,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Per Paust told Reuters.
      ""Norwegian business at an early stage started restructuring
  its relations with South Africa in anticipation of the law.
      ""No one has said the boycott will have a profound effect on
  international trade with South Africa, but it is an important
  political statement by the Norwegian government,"" he said.
      The Oslo government said it will review the effects of the
  ban on Norwegian industry after two years and may propose
  amendments if industry can show it is hurt by the law.
      Norwegian imports from South Africa are limited mainly to
  high-grade manganese and coppernickle ores used in it
  ferro-alloys and light metals industries.
      Metals manufacturers estimate some 2,000 jobs could be
  affected by the boycott is suitable replacements for these ores
  are not found.
      The legislation now goes on to the upper house for formal
  ratification later this week, parliamentarians said.

  Coastal Corp said a federal bankruptcy
  court will hear its request today for a restraining order to
  stop a two billion dlr lawsuit against it by &lt;TransAmerican
  Natural Gas Corp>.
      TransAmerican, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy
  proceedings in 1983 to reorganise its debts, filed the lawsuit
  to block Coastal from taking control.
      Coastal spokesman Jim Bailey confirmed the company, which
  is an unsecured creditor of TransAmerican, would present its
  own reorganisation plan to the bankruptcy court.
      Under the plan, Coastal would buy the natural gas reserves
  and pipeline system owned by TransAmerican in Texas for an
  undisclosed amount.
      TransAmerican lawyer John Nabors said the company values
  its total assets, including an unused oil refinery, at about
  one billion dlrs.
      The company, the second-largest natural gas producer in
  Texas, said it has gas reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic feet and
  over 1,000 miles of pipeline and gas gathering lines.
      About 80 pct of TransAmerican's gas is available for spot
  market sales in Texas during peak demand, it said.
      Nabors said the TransAmerican reorganisation would repay
  its 770 mln dlr debt with profits from natural gas sales. The
  lawsuit seeks one billion dlrs in actual damages and one
  billion in punitive damages from Coastal.
      Coastal has been trying to break into the Texas gas market
  since 1979, when it was forced to sell &lt;Lo-Vaca Gas Gathering
  Co> to settle over 1.6 billion dlrs in lawsuits by Texas
  customers facing abrupt curtailment of supply.
      Coastal, a natural gas producer and pipeline company,
  earned 71.6 mln dlrs on sales of 6.7 billion in 1986, about
  half the its 1985 profits, due to slumping energy prices.

  A government study has concluded the
  U.S. Will be dependent on oil from the middle east into the
  next century and must take steps to reduce its vulnerability,
  the New York Times said.
      The newspaper said the inter-agency government study found
  a serious oil-dependency problem due to steadily falling
  domestic production and rising demand for imported oil.
      The study concluded that by 1995 the U.S. Will be relying
  on foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil, more than the peak
  of 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate during
  the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.
      The U.S. Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs, up from
  27 pct a year ago, the New York Times said.
      It said recommendations sent to the White House by Energy
  Secretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raise
  domestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from the
  current 8.4 mln barrels.
      The newspaper said the administration has placed increased
  emphasis on stockpiling oil reserves. It said the view now held
  is that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in times
  of shortages, should be increased by 100,000 barrels a day,
  rather than 35,000 as called for in the 1988 budget.
     The newspaper said Harrington may propose restoring the
  depletion allowance to major producers.
      ""The administration also plans to renew its efforts to
  ...Repeal the windfall profits tax, remove bars to drilling on
  the outer continental shelf and repeal the law that limits the
  use of natural gas in industrial and utility boilers,"" it added.
      The New York Times quoted Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma
  as saying the study greatly underestimated potential U.S.
  Demand for imported oil in the next decade and overestimated
  the amount of domestic oil which would be produced.

  Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oil
  producers, announced today, are aimed at encouraging
  developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost
  opportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the Inland
  Revenue said in a post-budget statement.
      Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced
  in his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companies
  will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying
  development expenditure on certain future oil fields against
  Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT).
      To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on an
  individual field itself, when its income stream began, but was
  not immediately available against other development
  expenditure, the statement said.
      The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern
  basin for which development
  consent is first given on or after today, and will improve the
  post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies
  to proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said.
      Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow
  certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at
  present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT
  liability.
      This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the
  U.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in a
  particular field within three years of being incurred, to be
  allowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the Inland
  Revenue said.
      This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more
  in line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned to
  encourage general research into ways of reducing field
  development costs, it said.
      In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mln
  stg a year, it calculated.
      The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical
  measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech.
      These included measures to allow companies to balance their
  shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two
  past periods of allowance utilisation.
      Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs
  were announced, while there were also ammendments on rules on
  corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the
  so-called ""ring fence"" of activities in the U.K. And its
  continental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions for
  the implementation of measures announced in November, it said.
      Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers
  Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs
  on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry.
      He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would
  favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields
  such Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward.
      Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields
  might also be encouraged, he said.
      Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore
  construction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs
  under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year.
      He pointed out that the relief only applies to the
  development of new fields outside the Southern Basin.
      This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the
  central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than
  in the south and thus have greater capital and labour
  requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south.
      He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure
  would help fundamental research in the oil industry, although
  the benefits of this research would not be seen for several
  year.

  ""although we have made gains in energy security in the last six

  consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.
      Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign
  oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.
      President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a
  determination that the country never again become captive to a

  supply with a modern refinery and access to markets.
      ""we are looking to a long-term relationship, and at a time
  of protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there are
  clear benefits to both sides,"" he said.
      Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even with
  an oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily over
  the years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelan
  heavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities and
  obtain a competitive product yield.
      ""therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been a
  consideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seen
  what such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impact
  on today's agreement,"" adams said.
      He said the refinery could run crude as heavy as
  venezuela's bolivar coastal field (bcf) 17 api without any
  difficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier diet
  to take advantage of bigger margins.
      The refinery has a capacity to process up to 110,000 bpd of

  caused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced to
  curtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC
  states could not be sustained in some cases.
      ""For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now
  considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its member
  countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing
  production,"" Al-Wattari said.
      ""Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,""
  Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures,
  some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use
  and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added.
      Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the
  organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in
  February, although this had meant sacrifices.
      The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability,
  though restored to a good level, was still under pressure,
  Al-Wattari said. ""A lasting stability in the world market
  requires a wider scope of international cooperation,"" he added.
      He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a
  political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC.
      But although cutbacks announced by these states were
  politically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they were
  insufficient in terms of volume, he added. ""The overall majority
  of non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC's
  calls for supply regulation,"" he said.
      Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it
  allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to
  continue, while not generating excessive cash flow for
  otherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a price
  would no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added.
      Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, also
  addressing the seminar, added that discipline was still needed
  to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market.
      Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous
  for both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperation
  would ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue.

  The U.K. Government forecasts that oil
  revenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year
  1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in
  1985/86.
      The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement and
  Budget Report issued after the Chancellor of the Exchequer
  Nigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament.
      The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15
  dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oil
  revenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remaining
  close to current levels, the Treasury document said.
      The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall will
  reflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporation
  tax is paid after a time lag.
      The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference
  in oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mln
  stg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a full
  year.
      Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987,
  according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes in
  production would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88
  and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added.
      Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are now
  estimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the
  1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts,
  despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts.
      Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billion
  stg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the
  overshoot.
      Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to
  168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items,
  besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of
  40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year.
      Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5
  billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in
  1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion,
  compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion this
  fiscal year.
      The general government expenditure for the coming fiscal
  year is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised
  164.9 billion in the current year.
      A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations' market and
  overseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total Public
  Sector Borrowing Requirement down to 3.9 billion stg in
  1987/88, from this year's revised 4.1 billion, the Treasury
  said.

  Malaysia's state oil company Petronas
  will cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) from
  May 1, trade sources said.
      Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last
  September to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latest
  cut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986's target level.
      Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its
  10 pct production cutback until mid-1987.
      However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual report
  that Malaysia's crude oil output was expected to rise to an
  average 510,000 bpd in 1987.
      The ministry's forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices
  at 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permit
  further production cutbacks, the sources said.
      Malaysia's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl

      Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to

      The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, as
  there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due

"training/6656";"Energy_Resources";"2";"ENERGY/DRILLING INDUSTRY
  The drastic cutbacks in U.S. drilling
  last year are rapidly deflating the United State's natural gas
  bubble, which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next
  winter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch, industry analysts
  said.
      Faltering deliverability of natural gas, a commodity that
  is difficult and costly to import in large quantities, could
  more than double the current U.S. rig count to near 2,000 by
  1990, some analysts said.
      The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities
  and big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of
  activity in the Gulf of Mexico's offshore waters where some of
  the nation's largest gas reserves are located.
      ""We think an upturn in U.S. drilling is imminent,"" said
  James Crandall, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. ""Many
  companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling
  because they're betting that the gas market will be back in
  balance in a year or two.""
      The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news
  for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely
  survived last year's plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs a
  barrel to less than half that. Today's relatively stable oil
  prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a
  return to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rig
  count soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfield
  roustabouts commanded premium wages.
      The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> rig count, a
  barometer of the oil industry's health, showed 761 U.S. rigs
  active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year.
      In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 but
  dived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oil
  prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times.
      Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said ""In 1986, the United
  States replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that
  replacement rate won't be any better this year.""
      He added, ""We don't have the options we do with oil.
  Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and
  importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible
  in the next 10 years because of the cost.""
      Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves
  were discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16
  trillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates.
      George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co
  agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a
  new cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling.
      ""We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to
  dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990
  supplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no later
  than mid-1988,"" Gaspar said.
      Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that
  could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count
  to peak near 2,000 in December of 1989.
      Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be
  conducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where
  federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the
  government unless drilling begins in the next two or three
  years. Some of the industry's biggest companies, such as Exxon
  Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum have
  already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later
  this year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said.
      For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont &lt;DD> subsidiary, will
  spend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico's deepest
  production platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of
  gas per day.
      But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas and
  Kansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership &lt;MLP> in
  recent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry is
  on the verge of a recovery.
      Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below
  600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do.
      ""The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets
  above 30 dlrs a barrel,"" said Pickens, 58, adding he did not
  expect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime.
      Tenneco Inc &lt;TGT>, one of the largest U.S. gas producers,
  is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists.
      Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect
  significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s
  when the U.S. gas reserves life will have declined to about
  seven years' supply. Current spot market prices of about 1.50
  dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three
  dlrs to spur reserve replacement, he said.

       The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil
  prices, which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to
  as low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Prices have since steadied to
  around 18 dlrs a barrel.
       At the same time, a number of company executives testified
  that the nation's domestic exploration and production segment
  was still hurting and in need of government help.
       Production costs are considerably higher in the United
  States than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell
  many domestic producers were forced to shut down their
  operations. Currently, there are only about 760 oil rigs
  operating in the United States compared with an average of
  nearly 2,000 in 1985.
       Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of
  Energy, many said the falling production of domestic oil
  coupled with increasing U.S. demand, was leading to a growing
  dependency on imports, particularly from the politically
  volatile Middle East.
       ""In the U.S., 1986 petroleum production responded to lower
  prices, increasing about 2.5 pct, or 400,000 barrels per day
  (bpd),"" said J.S. Simon, General Manager of the Supply
  Department at Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, the nation's largest oil
  company.
       At the same time, Simon said ""U.S. oil production declined
  by 300,000 bpd, the first decline in several years,"" and ""net
  petroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5.3 mln bpd.""
       Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain
  between 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel, depending on OPEC's ability to
  control production, Simon said demand is expected to remain at
  1986 levels, leading to ""a significant amount of spare
  worldwide production capacity, in excess of 10 mln bpd.""
       He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued
  volatility and called for ""governmental and regulatory policies
  in support of the domestic petroleum industry.""
       Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal
  government through the 1986 tax code changes and ""Superfund""
  legislation, Simon called for the repeal of the windfall
  profits tax, total decontrol of natural gas and improved access
  to federal lands for oil and gas exploration.
       Simon did not mention an oil import fee, which many in the
  industry have called for as a way of building up the nation's
  domestic operations before imports reach such a level that
  national security might be compromised.
       In yesterday's report, the Energy Department said imports
  could make up 50 pct of U.S. demand by 1995, adding that
  Persian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the
  free world's total oil consumption by that date.
       Arguing that ""oil is a political tool in every nation on
  earth,"" Frank Pitts, chairman of &lt;Pitts Oil Co>, today called
  for a variable oil import fee, among other measures, ""before
  the treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and
  our national security is compromised.""
       Royce Wisenbaker, Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co,
  agreed, saying that like many federal government programs that
  were set up with good intentions, it would probably turn into a
  ""shambles.""
       Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future.
  ""For those of us who have managed to hold on, the worst is
  over,"" he said.
       Roger Hemminghaus, President of Diamond Shamrock Refining
  and Marketing Co, said he was ""enthusiastic about the future,""
  adding that he expected ""an increase in profitability by
  midyear.""

  New England Electric System &lt;NES>
  expects its cash construction spending to reach 205 mln dlrs
  this year, up from 188 mln dlrs in 1986, the utility said in
  material distributed at an analysts meeting.
      It said spending is expected to advance to 215 mln dlrs in
  1988 and 220 mln dlrs in 1989.
      The utility said these totals exclude spending on New
  England Hydro-Transmission being built to import electricity
  from Quebec Hydro. New England Electric is the operator of this
  venture as well as owning 51 pct of the project.
      The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year, 105 mln
  dlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmission
  lines from northern Quebec into New England, the utility said.
      New England Electric said internally generated funds will
  cover all of its power plant construction costs this year and
  65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units plan
  to spend in 1987.
      The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs on
  its oil and gas activities this year, adding internally
  generated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total.
      New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrs
  worth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additional
  higher cost preferred stock. Its Granite State Electric unit
  plans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this year
  as well.
      The company said it does not plan to offer common shares
  this year or in the foreseeable future, but expects to raise
  about 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under its
  dividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans.
      President Samuel Huntington told the analysts the
  construction spending projection is based on the expectation
  that demand for electricity in the New England electric system
  will grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years.
      However, the utility cannot ignore the potential for
  sharper growth, he said, pointing out that demand was up 5.2
  pct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years.
      He attributed this growth to declining electricity prices
  and a strong New England economy.
      Huntington said New England Elecetric has ""all but rejected
  new coal fired plants"" to supply additional power.
      He said the most attractive new power supplies are those
  with short lead times which can be built in modules.
      Later, vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility is
  looking at gas-fired, combined cycle generating units to supply
  most of its new power needs, but has not rejected coal-fired
  fluidized bed units.
      He explained that fluidized bed technology is available in
  modular units, adding that Huntington was referring to the
  traditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal.

      Reserves were just 5.77 billion barrels in 1974, rose
  sharply to 40.19 billion in 1978 and flattened out at 72
  billion in both 1981 and 1982.
      In its annual report, pemex said average crude output in

  The U.S. Congress and the oil industry
  are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the
  industry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and the
  subsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said.
      ""The industry is deeply divided between those who support an
  oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,""
  said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research
  Associates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S.
  Congress on energy issues.
      Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax
  incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee.
      Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he will
  propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural
  gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for
  consideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
  proposal would be reviewed.
      Herrington said, ""I would like to shoot for one mln barrels
  a day (addition) to U.S. production."" U.S. oil output was off to
  8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from last
  year, the American Petroleum Institute said.
      Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average
  about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a
  move above that level will be unlikey for the near term.
      Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that
  ""even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we've
  only altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs for
  the year.""
      Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and
  exploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil output
  will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable
  prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration.
      John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry
  Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to
  Congress said ""The continuing decline in U.S. oil production is
  virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. But
  the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil
  prices and U.S. government policy.""
      Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil
  production but would only work over time.
      ""Lowering the producing industry's tax burden would probably
  be a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase but
  would not raise energy costs."" Lichtblau said.
      But the small independent oil companies who do much of the
  drilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate relief
  which could be brought on by an oil import fee.
      Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the International
  Association of Drilling Contractors, said, ""The members of our
  trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil
  import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our
  nation."" The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oil
  service companies.
      The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee
  will face a stiff uphill battle.
      Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by
  a former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oil
  import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a
  means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry.
       At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed
  opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would
  hurt consumers and some regional interests.
      But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow
  if production continued to fall and imports to rise.
      Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements
  ""is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move above
  that level, a fee may not be legislated but there will
  certainly be pressure for some form of action.""
       But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, ""a 50 pct
  rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990.
      In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energy
  requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added.

  Higher world oil prices, coupled with a
  new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia's
  economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget
  deficits, bankers and diplomats said.
      The months ahead will prove critical as the government
  attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices
  and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private
  sector.
      Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to
  about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could
  grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982.
      But the economists said this will be possible only if the
  Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds
  in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced
  to curtail output for too long.
      Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend
  OPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price.
      Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at
  about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi
  Arabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987.
      King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC's
  new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western
  diplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a
  stable source of income for its economy.
      Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is a
  hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining
  revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross
  domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985.
      Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10
  dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion
  dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981.
      ""Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not
  be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can
  afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst
  effects,"" a diplomat said.
      In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of
  lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on
  foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs.
      But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers
  and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in
  the longer term.
      It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a
  time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise
  to take over the lead role in the economy.
      Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of
  the risks attached to this policy but is determined to ""tough it
  out"" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion
  of reserves.
      The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion
  riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly
  recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign
  borrowing has been ruled out.
      Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi
  businessmen this week the government had carefully considered
  the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget
  plans late last year.
      ""It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50
  billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the
  economy,"" he said.
      Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early
  1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and
  tales of high spending became legendary.
      The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the
  fabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management
  had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom.
      Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced,
  markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut
  back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply.
      The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but
  Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate
  sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit.
      Government moves to encourage lending and investigate
  company complaints about late public sector contract payments
  could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's
  industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment.
      Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and
  more cash being placed on deposit.
      As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic
  development from the public to the private sector, one of the
  biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel
  personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom
  and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.

  The New York Mercantile Exchange set
  April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy

       On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not

  a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures
  market, according to an exchange spokeswoman.
      ""This will change the way oil is transacted in the real

      On the grounds of increasing production, he said, ""I would

  1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986
  levels.
      U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from
  184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from
  156 mln. Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in
  1985.
      Earlier, Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to
  134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985, before an extraordinary
  charge of 50 mln stg on the company's U.S. Assets. The results
  were slightly better than analysts forecast and the share
  firmed to 231p from 222p at last night's close. Chairman Sir
  Philip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986
  had made the period extremely difficult but the company had
  come through remarkably well.
      Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained, the
  conditions would be right for a substantially improved
  performance this year.
      He added that the firmness of oil prices in March, when
  they were normally weaker, made him ""a bit encouraged"" about the
  prospects for future levels.
      Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the price
  stayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel.
      Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcement
  of a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by the
  latter part of April.
      End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil compared
  with 503 mln previously. However, Walker noted that this
  included a revised definition of reserves.
      If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines, the
  reserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrels
  previously.
      Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from a
  restated 3,660 billion.

  The American Petroleum Institute
  said that U.S. crude oil production in February declined 9.8
  pct from year-ago levels to about 8.3 mln barrels a day.
      In its monthly report on U.S. oil supplies and stocks, API
  said that domestic demand for petroleum products, as measured
  by products supplied, continued to rise reaching 16.3 mln
  barrels a day in the month, up 1.5 pct from February 1986.
      API noted the drop in crude oil output coupled with a
  drop in natural gas liquids production, which was off 11 pct
  from February 1986 levels, represented a decline in U.S.
  production of more than one mln barrels a day.
      API said the decline in domestic production and the rise in
  demand brought petroleum imports to about six mln barrels a day
  in February, a 30.3 pct increase from last year's level.
      So far this year, API said growth in domestic demand, which
  was up 2.9 pct from last year's year-to-date level, has slowed
  in comparison to the accelerated growth in the last half of
  1986.
      It said crude oil production for the first two months of
  1987 was off 8.6 pct from the comparable year-ago period while
  crude imports were up 30.6 pct.

  The ""cross field allowance"" relief on
  Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the
  Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT
  paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co.
      The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of
  qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of
  other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments
  outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval.
      A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not
  paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly
  benefit in PRT saving on an existing field.
      ""The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators
  in those fields which have no PRT liability,"" the report said,
  adding that the timing of development of such fields may be
  advanced.
      The government would in effect be subsidising these
  developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before
  corporation tax, the report said.
      On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is
  of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will
  be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will
  rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said.
      In a study on probable fields, the report said that when
  the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying
  field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the
  U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a
  small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9
  pct.
      The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will
  be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only
  will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field's
  future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will
  be lost.
      Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts
  will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later
  time.

  Transco Exploration Partners Ltd said
  participation in 14 new discoveries increased its proved gas
  reserves to 558.1 billion cubic feet in 1986, up from 541.5
  billion cubic feet in the previous year.

  mln barrels, the company said in the 1986 annual just released
  by Transco Energy Co &lt;E>, the majority owner of the Transco
  Exploration partnership.
      Transco said that anticipated oil and gas prices during
  1987 would continue to exert pressure on the profitability of
  most energy companies.
      The Transco pipeline system reached permanent take-or-pay
  settlements on about half its committed gas deliverability and
  interim agreements for another 38 pct of its deliverability,
  the annual report said. The company said it paid a total of
  about 363 mln dlrs to producers through Februry one out of its
  550 mln dlr reserve to settle the take-or-pay disputes.
      Transco said its gas pipeline delivered more than 1.2

  an average of 1.6 billion cubic feet of gas per day.
      The company's exploration partnership received an average

  Amoco Corp's petroleum liquids reserves

  to 15.37 trillion cubic feet from 15.14 trillion, the company's
  annual report said.
      It said the drop in crude oil and natural gas liquid
  reserves reflected downward revisions of previous estimates
  caused by the sharp drop in oil prices last year. This
  accounted for 178 mln barrels of a worldwide downward revision
  of 188 mln barrels, with 158 mln barrels of the total revision
  occurring in the United States, the report said.
      Amoco said there were upward revisions in the size of its
  worldwide gas reserves totalling 404 billion cubic feet last
  year, while it discovered 568 billion cubic feet and purchased
  298 billion cubic feet of reserves.
      Production of one trillion cubic feet offset much of these
  gains, the report said.
      All of the gas reserve purchases, as well as all of the 14
  mln barrels of oil reserves bought in 1986, were in the United
  States, Amoco said, noting it has spent 1.1 billion dlrs to
  acquire U.S. producing properties over the past three years.
      Commenting on 1987, Amoco said acquisitions ""will be an
  integral part of our strategy, should reserves become available
  at attractive prices.""
      The company said it expects ""the marketing climate for
  natural gas to improve in 1987, which should provide the
  opportunity for Amoco to expand sales. As prices and demand
  improve, we are poised to accelerate capital spending on our
  inventory of attractive opportunities.""
      Amoco previously announced a 1987 capital spending budget
  of 3.2 billion dlrs. Such spending totaled 3.18 billion dlrs
  last year, down from 5.31 billion in 1985.

  First City Bancorporation's sale of 54
  mln dlrs in oil loans to Prudential-Bache should significantly
  reduce its energy problems, but the bank's losses are still
  virtually guaranteed to continue, analysts said.
      The package of energy loans was sold at book value, so
  First City did not to show a gain or loss, said bank spokesman
  James Day. He added it was possible First City would sell more
  of the bank's remaining 1.4 billion dlrs in oil-related loans
  to raise cash.
      The loans had been made by First City to oil producers and
  to oilfield service and supply companies. Day said some had
  already been classified as nonperforming, or charged off as a
  loss, but he could not identify how many were included in those
  categories.
      The loans were purchased by Prudential Bache's Energy
  Growth Fund, a limited partnership created last month with 90
  mln dlrs in funding to invest in oil and gas properties.
      First City, the big Texas bank hit hardest by the downturn
  in oil prices, lost a record 402 mln dlrs in fiscal year 1986
  and has said it is seeking a merger partner or some other
  capital assistance. The Houston-based bank's nonperforming
  assets totaled 897.1 mln dlrs at yearend, up from 563.1 mln
  dlrs at the end of 1985
      Analysts have said no buyer is likely to be interested in
  the troubled bank unless government assistance is available.
      ""Their problems are not just limited to energy. They have a
  substantial portfolio in real estate. This sale in and of
  itself won't make the company look better to a potential
  buyer,"" said Ray Archibold, a banking analyst with McCarthy,
  Crisanti and Maffei Inc.
      ""It does reduce the bank's exposure in energy loans and 54
  mln dlrs is a substantial amount,"" Archibold said, ""but the
  deal represents only about four pct of their energy loans.""
      Of First City's total loan portfolio of 9.9 mln dlrs, about
  14 pct or 1.4 billion dlrs were made to energy producers or
  suppliers, analysts said. Its record losses have been caused by
  its past status as one of the nation's top lenders to oil and
  gas producers and suppliers during the boom days of the late
  1970s and early 1980s.
      First City said about half of the loans sold to Prudential
  came from its Energy Finance Co., an entity formed in 1982 to
  loan money to ""more venturesome"" oil borrowers that promised a
  higher potential return. The other half of the loans were from
  First City's lead bank in Houston.
      Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co., said
  the sale of the package of energy loans was the first
  encouraging news from First City in months.
      ""It's not going to solve all of First City's problems but
  it's a good transaction for them. It may be possible for them
  to sell additional loans,"" Kotowski said. ""Prudential can fund
  these things more cheaply than First City and there's an
  incentive to invest in troubled energy companies right now as
  values are depressed""
      In a statement, First City chairman J.A. Elkins said the
  bank's strategy was to reduce the proportion of energy loans to
  total loans. ""This move, which we believe is the first
  transaction of its kind, helps us further, and we were able to
  make it without suffering a loss.""

  Higher crude oil prices will raise
  demand for natural gas, helping it to reclaim market share lost
  to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986, analysts said.
      The analysts said that these efforts will be most
  successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large
  and growing energy requirements.
      ""Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of
  oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual
  fuel industry last year,"" Michael Smolinski, an energy
  economist with Data Resources Inc, told Reuters.
      An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel went
  into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last
  year when world oil prices plunged, Smolinski said. 
      Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel, national
  average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected
  2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive,
  Michael German, vice president of economic analysis at American
  Gas Association said.
      The average delivered prices at the end of January were
  2.10 dlrs per mln Btu, compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago.
      ""We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic
  feet (of demand) in the overall energy market in the second and
  third quarter (1987),"" he said.
      In addition to price competitiveness, availability will be
  an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas,
  Frank Spadine, senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp.
  in New York noted.
      Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North
  American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and
  less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this
  spring freeing gas for spot sales.
      These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears
  that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices
  significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last
  year.
      AGA's German contended that despite the drilling decline,
  much of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to production
  quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which
  permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins.
      Citing recent EIA statistics, German said, the gas surplus
  was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986
  to two trillion cubic feet in 1987, but the surplus would not
  go away until 1990.
      Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would
  persist until 1990. While gas supplies may tighten in certain
  consuming areas, notably in California and in the Northeast
  U.S., an overall shortfall appeared remote.

      Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to
  the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31
  pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to
  bridge its deficit.
      Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto
  and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy
  change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost
  protected economy.
      ""Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call
  for major policy adjustments and external support,"" Conable said
  in his arrival statement.
      But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next
  month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that
  the Bank is demanding specific changes.
      ""We believe there has been wise leadership here and the
  economy is being very well managed,"" Conable told reporters at
  Jakarta airport.
      Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling
  37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the
  Third World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7
  billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968.
      Conable did not spell out what further changes he would
  like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes
  already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more.
      Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support,
  the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the
  government's trade reform measures, and supported its
  determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth.
      Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last
  May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage
  outside investment.
      Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look
  into which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be
  sold.
      But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the
  government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms.
      Western analysts say that in particular the government is
  unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost
  monopolies, which control core areas of the economy.
      Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that
  Indonesia faced very limited economic choices.
      It could not spend its way out of trouble because this
  would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic
  inflation.
       He said the main objective was to raise exports outside
  the oil and natural gas sector.
      Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the
  government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial
  year which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in
  1986/87.

  The government's
  over-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting
  Australia's economic performance, Australian Petroleum
  Exploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said.
      Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income is
  derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak
  crude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here.
      This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the
  country's economic performance directly by acting as a
  disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting
  trading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said.
      Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency
  position is posing a major economic threat, yet the
  government's response has been to load new tax burdens on the
  oil industry, Benbow said.
      Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to
  fall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from
  546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of the
  Bass Strait fields, he said.
      Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with the
  three largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said.
      By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just over
  half the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undeveloped
  fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from
  existing fields goes ahead, Benbow said.
      Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered
  fields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said.
      Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to
  680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying a
  crude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five years
  time, he said.
      At present world oil prices and the current value of the
  Australian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would cost
  between 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said.
      Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, the
  addition to reserves has been inadequate, he said.
      For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five
  years 1980-84 represent about two years' consumption, he said.
      He called on the government to review its tax policies to
  restore incentive to exploration.

  World governments
  should prepare for an inevitable significant increase in the
  price of oil as non-Middle East supplies diminish, Exxon Corp
  &lt;XON> director and senior vice-president Donald McIvor said.
      Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk
  of world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in a
  speech prepared for delivery to the Australian Petroleum
  Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference.
      It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere
  will not change this fact, he said.
      McIvor said 37 of the world's 30,000 oil fields contain
  about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered.
      Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside the
  Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the
  last 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said.
      He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming
  20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the
  rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year.
      More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the
  Middle East, he said.
      McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil
  outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a
  diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic
  stability.
      ""It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country
  discoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable
  taxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up of
  acreage for exploration,"" he said.
      Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost the
  incentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources of
  petroleum, he added.

  A 10 percentage
  point reduction in the Australian government's maximum crude
  oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output,
  resources analyst Ian Story said here.
      A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait
  output to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrels
  per day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000
  BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration
  Association annual conference.
      Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney
  stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd.
      Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer
  appropriate in the current economic climate, Story said.
      The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered
  before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co
  Ltd &lt;BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp &lt;XON> partnership to shut-in
  production, accelerating the decline in output and reducing
  government revenue, he said.
      He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30
  Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrs
  if the levy was cut to 70 pct.
      ""The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive
  at oil prices below 30 dlrs,"" Story said.
      Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher
  levels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boost
  exports and provide incentives for exploration and development,
  he said.
      The government is currently reviewing the oil tax
  structure.

      He said the rest of the 178,500 bpd refinery, including the
  19,000 bpd catalytic cracker, was undamaged. The whole refinery
  was closed pending enquiries but a decision when to reopen the
  main units will be taken in the next couple of days, he said.
      But there was extensive damage to the central part of the
  32,000 bpd hydrocracker, which upgrades heavy oil products to
  gasoline, and it will be out of operation for some months.
      The spokesman said BP will not suffer supply shortages as a
  result of the explosion as it will be able to bring in product
  from other sources. BP has a 437,000 bpd refinery in Rotterdam,
  a 181,900 bpd unit at Ingolstadt, West Germany, a 181,900 bpd
  plant at Lavera in France and a smaller Swedish plant.
      He said the explosion and fire, in which one worker was

  Iran said reports that it intended to
  threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless, and warned the

      Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign
  Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would
  be met by ""a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the
  world.""
       U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks
  apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do
  whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face
  of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf.
      The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been
  told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a
  threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf.
      U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made
  anti-ship ""Silkworm"" missiles, which pose a greater threat to
  merchant ships than missiles used before.
      The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended
  to attack ships were ""misleading propaganda.""
      He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main cause
  of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use ""all
  its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension.""
      Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. ""We

  going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very
  vital waterway.""
      ""We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of what

  The world's dependency on the Mideast
  as the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going
  to stop it, Donald K. McIvor, an Exxon Corp &lt;XON> Director and
  senior vice president told Reuters in an interview.
      ""Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap
  between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to
  increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is
  inevitable,"" McIvor said.
      Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are
  not likely to change a growing dependence, McIvor said.
      McIvor, Exxon's senior vice president responsible for oil
  and gas exploration and production said that dependence would
  result from the Mideast's large spare capacity at a time when
  the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding.
      ""Since 1970 we've been consuming oil at rates of 20-25
  billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only
  about 10-15 bilion barrels per year,"" McIvor said.
      ""The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the
  remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is
  producing at much less than current capacity,"" he added.
      McIvor said that of the some 30,000 oil fields discovered
  so far only 37 ""one-one thousandth of the total number contained
  about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered.""
      McIvor said, in response to a question, that he did not
  believe there were any more ""super giants"", or oil fields with
  reserves greater than five billion barrels, to be found which
  would change the conclusion of the world's growing dependency.
      ""Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle
  East. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20
  years and only two of these lie outside the middle east
  (Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska's North Slope)."" McIvor said.
      McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S.
  like Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a
  peak and would soon begin to decline.
      But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty
  of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the
  Middle east, particulartly in Canada, the North Sea, and
  Australia and Africa.
      McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those
  areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher
  price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the
  companies.
      ""The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a
  constant change in policies,"" McIvor said.
      McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to
  increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the
  economy at the expense of other parts of the economy.
      Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. Energy
  Secretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said he
  could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance
  now but ""the thrust of his (Herrington) report is valid. It has
  highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the
  need to increase U.S. production.""
      McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a
  greater role in the future in meeting energy needs.
      ""Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an
  increasingly important part of the worlkd's energy supply,""
  McIvor said.
      ""Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation
  fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat, as an
  industrial fuel,"" he added.

      ""We believe the Kuwaitis have also approached the Soviet

      The officials, who asked not to be identified, said Kuwait

  -- into the northern Indian Ocean in the past month.
      White House and defense officials said today that massing
  of the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the
  Iran-Iraq war or Iran's recent stationing of Chinese-made 
  anti-ship missiles near the mouth of the Gulf.
      The land-based missiles have increased concern in Kuwait

  Iraq said today its warplnes had
  attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to
  keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends.
      The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations
  broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action.
      It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad
  hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian
  year which ended on Saturday.
      A high command communique said warplanes hit the western
  jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and
  struck a supertanker nearby at the same time.
      The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August
  1985, was last raided in January.
      The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said
  columns of smoke were seen billowing from it.
      In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian
  tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier
  Gulf attack.
      But there has been no independent confirmation of today's
  supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by
  Baghdad in the past 24 hours.
      The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March eight,
  when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg.
      Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at
  Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50
  miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said.
      The three oilfields have been raided several times in the
  past three years. Oil sources said they were not crucially
  important to Iran's oil export trade.
      A second high command communique today said Iraqi warplanes
  flew 94 sorties against Iranan targets and positions at the war
  front.
      It also reported a clash between Iraqi naval units and
  several Iranian boats carrying men to attack an Iraqi oil
  terminal at the northen tip of the Gulf.
      Two Iranian boats wer destroyed and sunk with their

  Energy analyst Edward Krapels said
  the United States should consider an oil tariff to keep U.S.
  dependence on imports below 50 pct.
      ""On the supply side, the argument in favor of a contingent,
  variable import tariff is most persuasive,"" Krapels, president
  of Energy Security Analysis, Inc said in a statement at a House
  Energy and Power subcommittee hearing.
      ""An optimal tariff would be one implemented only if the
  international price of crude oil falls below, say, 15 dlrs a
  barrel. On the demand side, the obvious policy is an excise tax
  on transportation fuels,"" Krapels said.
      But William Johnson of the Jofree Corp disagreed with the
  oil tariff proposal, saying Congress should remove price
  controls on natural gas, repeal the windfall profits tax on oil
  companies, allow exports of Alaskan oil and provide tax
  incentives for U.S. oil production, or, at the least, preserve
  exisiting tax incentives for drilling. He also urging filling

      Richard Adkerson of Arthur Andersen and Co told the

  funds for exploration and development of domestic oil sources
  cannot now be economically justified due to low oil prices.

  Australia's crude
  oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a
  targeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resources
  and Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here.
      He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association
  (APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a
  package that would recognise the government's economic
  priorities while also meeting some of the industry's concerns.
      Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review
  of oil taxation.
      Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted
  approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results
  in recent years.
      These include the reduction in the top marginal crude
  excise rate on 'old' Bass Strait oil found before September
  1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshore
  oil announced last September, he said.
      The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for the
  elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost
  incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices
  and Australia's relatively low exploration levels.
      ""While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to
  an already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favour
  these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes,
  which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may still
  leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are
  going to do in major areas,"" Evans said.
      He said the government did not intend to change its
  resource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now before
  parliament, in response to industry calls to allow all
  exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible.
      As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to
  highly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after a
  certain rate of return has been achieved for individual
  projects.
      APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because
  exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects.
      Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more
  than anything on the government's desire to ensure the
  certainty and stability of the new regime, adding that major
  investments have already been planned on the existing ground
  rules.

  Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AMS> unit
  &lt;Shell Australia Ltd>, said its net profit fell to 45.79 mln
  dlrs in 1986 from 66.76 mln in 1985.
      Revenue fell to 4.55 billion dlrs from 4.91 billion, in an
  extremely competitive and over-regulated environment, chairman
  and chief executive Kevan Gosper said in a statement. A 26.25
  mln dlr annual dividend would be paid to the parent after a
  very disappointing year.
      ""A return of 2.2 pct on funds employed represents a very
  meagre return ... In an economy suffering from inflation of
  around 10 pct,"" he said.
      Gosper said the results reflected heavy reliance on
  downstream oil and chemicals, poor coal and metal returns and
  the financial burden of the North-West Shelf gas project.
      Duties, royalties and taxes rose to 1.37 billion dlrs
  against 852.72 mln in 1985 and Gosper urged the government to
  move quickly to lift costly and unnecessary regulation.
      ""It is just as important for Australia to maintain a
  financially healthy, technically advanced refining and
  marketing industry as it is to sustain oil exploration and
  production,"" he said.
      ""The Australian oil industry has the experience and the
  capacity to serve the nation and its shareholders well if the
  government would stop putting roadblocks in our way,"" he said.
      Shell invested 500 mln dlrs over the past five years to
  upgrade its oil refining and marketing business, but further
  investment required an appropriate rate of return, he said.
      Exploration and evaluation spending in 1986 fell to 18.77
  mln dlrs from 26.35 mln, while investment in property and plant
  rose to 374.25 mln from 353.94 mln a year earlier.
      Gosper said oil companies would be under intense pressure
  in 1987 because of forecast slow economic growth.

  World Bank president Barber Conable
  pledged the Bank's support to help Indonesia adjust to lower

  protected economy was needed.
      Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto,
  he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the
  economy and deregulate trade policy.
      Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which
  cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third
  World's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs
  from the World Bank in the past 20 years.
      Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300
  mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was
  prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to
  lower oil and primary commodity prices.
      ""We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are
  consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy,"" he
  said.
      He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after last
  year's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the
  difficulties now faced by other countries.
      Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the
  dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and
  has announced a series of measures since May intended to
  stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise
  the economy.
      However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics
  and high tariff barriers remain in place.
      Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met

  The council of the

  will press on with its campaign for major improvements to
  Australia's petroleum taxation structure.
      The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly
  disappointed by the Australian government's position on
  taxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy
  Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference.
      As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target
  any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to
  secondary taxation of petroleum.
      APEA had expected the government to make positive responses
  to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of
  existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and
  development, the council said.
      It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by
  Evans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed
  with the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation.
      Evans told the conference the government did not plan to
  accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow
  deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure.
      ""The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction of
  unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore
  area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is
  profit based,"" the APEA council said.
      The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil
  exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the
  industry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry's
  problems, the council said.
      The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory
  secondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major
  disincentives at a time of low oil prices.

  Leading Australian onshore oil and gas
  producer, Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>, said its 1986 results were hit
  by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate and
  liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
      The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net
  profit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985.
      Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement
  that increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, along
  with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil
  exploration and development outlays, were helping Santos deal
  with an adverse business climate.
      Santos said it remained financially strong with an
  injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985
  rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the
  end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier.
      It said it had also made significant progress in repaying
  debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders' funds
  had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54.
      Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid
  for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas
  company &lt;TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln
  dlrs.
      Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar
  denominated and significant currency purchases were made during
  the year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held
  145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments.
      Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program,
  finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil
  exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to
  reserves -- less than depletion during the year.
      Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme
  to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for
  oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct.
      Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and
  production volumes but with extra oil exploration and
  encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism.
      But it called on the goverment to continue fostering
  domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme.
      ""It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when
  exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when
  Australia's oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly,""
  Massy-Green said.

  The U.S. Has offered warships to

      The officials told Reuters yesterday the offer was made

      Reagan administration officials said later that Washington
  did not seek military confrontation with Tehran, but would not
  let Iran use Chinese-made ""Silkworm"" anti-ship missiles, capable
  of covering the narrow entrance to the Gulf, to choke oil
  shipments to the West.
      Defence officials said Kuwait had asked if protection for
  up to a dozen vessels, most of them tankers, could be provided
  by three U.S. Navy destroyers and two frigates now in the
  southern Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.
      In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy's small
  Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has
  moved 18 warships, including the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk,
  into the northern Arabian Sea in the past month.
      White House and defence officials said that massing the
  fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran-Iraq war
  or Iran's stationing of missiles near the mouth of the Gulf.
      The State Department said on Friday that Iran has been told

  Gulf. The communication was sent through Switzerland, which
  represents U.S. Interests in Iran.
      Iran denied as baseless reports that it intended to

  the region would meet a strong response, Tehran Radio said on
  Sunday.
      Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in the Gulf
  by Iran and Iraq since early 1984 in the so-called tanker war,

  John Herrington said he was ""optimistic"" about the chances of
  providing a more generous depletion allowance for oil and gas
  producers, but added that the plan faces strong opposition from
  some members of the Reagan administration.
      Herrington, speaking to Houston oil executives at a

  a 27.5 pct annual depletion allowance was ""heavy and strong""
  largely because of some fears that the U.S. oil industry could
  eventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as the
  agriculture industry.
      Herrington's proposed tax incentives for the oil industry
  were issued last week after the Department of Energy released a
  comprehensive report finding U.S. national security could be
  jeopardized by rising oil imports.
      In response to a question from Mitchell Energy and
