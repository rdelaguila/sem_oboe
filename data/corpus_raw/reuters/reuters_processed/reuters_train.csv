  Shares of Dome Petroleum Ltd posted
  their biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stock
  markets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for the
  debt-heavy company.
      Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange and
  gained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto Stock
  Exchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as high
  as 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Dome
  has normally moved by only a few cents per day.
      TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr
  Canadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, but
  Dome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also still
  talking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.
      Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed
  to be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterday
  stressed that its bid is ""a Canadian solution to the financial
  difficulties of Dome Petroleum.""
      ""The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont
  &lt;DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC>, which sold its Canadian
  interest in 1975 and could be getting back in,"" said Wilf Gobert
  of Peters and Co Ltd.
      David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that British
  Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite
  BP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent
  of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> it does not already own.
      Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has said
  in recent reports that Amoco Corp &lt;AN> has also been in talks
  with Dome.
      Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,
  Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment.
      Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as ""awfully
  optimistic,"" given TransCanada's offer to give current Dome
  shareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10
  dlrs Canadian per common share.
      Under the offer, current Dome common and preferred
  shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which
  would own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada
  would own 80 pct.
      However, Bryson said the market may be looking at the
  potential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. ""The
  TransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,""
  he said.
      Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is ""at the
  upper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome.""
      The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87
  billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with another
  one billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to
  secured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a
  certain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level.
      Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion
  Canadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took on
  several years ago when oil prices were high and the company
  wanted to expand.
      ""There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable
  of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that
  basis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,""
  Gobert said.
      Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it
  is a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds
  reserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion
  cubic feet of natural gas.
      The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres
  of oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, the
  heart of Canada's oil industry.
     Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of
  land across Canada.
     The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs
  Canadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of
  2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be the
  largest ever by a Canadian company.

  A sharp rise in Soviet sugar consumption
  since the start of the Kremlin's anti-alcohol drive indicates
  home brewing is costing the state 20 billion roubles in lost
  vodka sales, Pravda said.
      The Communist Party newspaper said sugar sales had
  increased by one mln tonnes a year, enough to be turned into
  two billion bottles of moonshine.
      At current vodka prices of 10 roubles a bottle, it said,
  this meant illicit alcohol consumption had reached the
  equivalent of 20 billion roubles a year, or annual revenues
  from vodka sales before the May 1985 anti-alchohol decree.
      ""Official statistics show a reduction in consumption of
  vodka, but this is a deceptive statistic -- it does not count
  home-brew,"" Pravda said.
      ""The epidemic first engulfed the villages and has now also
  firmly settled into cities, where the availability of natural
  gas, running water and privacy has made it much easier.""
      Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev launched the anti-alcohol
  campaign shortly after taking office in March 1985 as a first
  step to improving Soviet economic performance, which had been
  seriously hurt by drunkenness among the working population.

  The Senate unanimously approved
  legislation to lift a ban on new construction of natural

  plants.
      The bill, sponsored by Senate Energy Committee chairman
  Bennett Johnston, also repeals mandatory incremental pricing of
  natural gas which was designed to protect residential consumers
  from major price increases by forcing some industrial users to
  pay higher than market prices.
      ""This legislation will open up new natural gas markets,"" the
  Lousiana Democrat said.
      The gas restrictions were enacted in 1978 in response to a
  shortage of natural gas and predictions of higher prices.
      ""Now both oil and gas prices are severely depressed,""
  Johnston said.
      In a compromise with coal producers, the bill requires new

  Financial analysts say they are
  pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal
  budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help
  improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.
      The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow
  to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming
  fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.
      Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan
  that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next
  year.
          ""In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is
  infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little
  impact on the economy and the trade deficit,"" said Stanley
  Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.
      ""At best, it will have a small positive effect,"" Collander
  said in an interview.
      Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly
  told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way
  to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease
  some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.
      The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade
  imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker
  has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught
  with danger.
      Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as
  imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign
  capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.
      In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other
  major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of
  the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates
  should be stabilized at around current levels.
      As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to
  take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States
  agreed to cut its budget deficit.
      The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a
  way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is
  to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.
      ""If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else
  you do is going to be counterproductive,"" Volcker said in recent
  testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
      Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the
  government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit
  supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or
  to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United
  States.
      Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the
  current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.
      Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed
  that any deficit reduction was better than none.
      But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were 
  not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it
  needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar
  from plunging further in world exchange markets.
      ""There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if
  your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the
  Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer
  is, it's not enough,"" Silvia told Reuters.
      The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's
  most vexing and persistent problems.
      The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet
  little indication that this year's figure will be any lower,
  though administration officials have predicted it will drop by
  about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.
      In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep
  worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the
  federal budget.
      On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not
  attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for
  the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced
  budget law.
      While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for
  next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget
  Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall
  short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.
      ""For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the
  most you're going to get"" out of Congress at the present time,
  said Touche Ross's Collander. ""To do something more than that
  would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.""
      Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up
  short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.
      ""To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable
  reduction level,"" he explained. ""Anything less than that will now
  look like a failure to Wall Street.""
      The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would
  lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year
  beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting
  defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their
  anticipated spending levels for next year.
      The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of
  nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new 
  taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.

  Bond Corp Holdings Ltd &lt;BONA.S> and Atlas
  Consolidated Mining and Development Corp &lt;ATLC.MN> are still
  holding talks on a bail-out package for the troubled mining
  firm, an Atlas statement said.
      Atlas, the Philippines' biggest copper producer, said it
  had been hit by depressed world copper prices. It reported a
  net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986,
  compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985.
      The company said it had been able to cut its losses because
  its scaled-down copper operations in the central island of Cebu
  started in the second half of 1986.
      Atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisition
  by Bond of the company's existing bank loans and their
  restructuring into a gold loan.
      A memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in
  October last year said Bond would acquire Atlas' total loans of
  275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold.
      Atlas said the two sides were also discussing equity
  infusion into Atlas and the creation of a development fund for
  further exploration and development of the company's gold
  properties in the central province of Masbate.
      Wilson Banks, general manager of &lt;Bond Corp International

  negotiations was ""reasonably accurate.""
      Banks said Bond Corp was seriously considering several
  investments in the Philippines but did not give details.
      In its statement, Atlas said development of the pre-World

  the ore tonnage had increased, extending the operation's life

  Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta plan
  this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European

  institute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said.
      ""The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic
  Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now,"" he
  said.
       ""This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there
  is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy,
  which have a similar productive structure,"" he said.
      The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and other
  fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence in
  international trade fairs.
      Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well as
  traditional industrial exports will be promoted.
      Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20
  billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while the
  government's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special
  25 billion peseta grant.
      The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in
  real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year.
      Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in
  developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand,
  which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985.

  The south China province of Guangdong is
  importing millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas and

  to more profitable crops, the Peking Review magazine said.
      The official magazine said the province's grain area fell
  to 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of a
  total farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares.
      Farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane,
  bananas, oranges, papaya and freshwater fish-farming, in part
  to supply major consumer markets in Hong Kong and Macao, the
  magazine said. It gave no 1986 area figures.
      The magazine said China aims to keep 80 pct of national
  farmland under grain, 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct under
  other crops, although the ratio will vary from place to place.
      It said primitive cultivation methods, labour-intensity and

  The current crude oil price of between
  18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next couple
  of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to
  keep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said.
      Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade
  officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint
  by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government
  officials said.
      They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made
  the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third
  World debt and industrialised nations.
      Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher
  energy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said.
      Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the
  beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial
  countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead
  to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he
  said.
      This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high
  prices, he added.

      At a press conference, Republican lawmakers said they would

  Crude oil prices could remain around 18

  output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an
  official of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos
  (Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.
      Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of
  international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared
  to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself
  for the third quarter. ""Production is surging ahead of what was
  originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than
  envisaged a few months ago,"" he said.
      He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of
  production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the
  18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been
  envisaged might soften price levels.
      The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in
  Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output.
      ""I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in
  terms of volume decisions,"" Lajous said.
      A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted
  output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is
  always there as a possibility, he said.
      ""I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I
  expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and
  discipline will be maintained,"" he said.
      Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as
  this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil
  markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during
  1987 if output remains under control.

      By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S.

  removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely
  used government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing.
      ""Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grant

  subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any
  countervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadian
  resource exports to the U.S.
      Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices and

  prospects of totally transforming their economic habits.
      The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese
  prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to
  raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to
  the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral
  semiconductor pact.
      British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to
  block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese
  placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid
  by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic
  telecommunications joint venture.
      On Friday, European currency dealers said European central
  banks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might
  leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.
      Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group
  Keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory
  views last November when he visited the European Community.
  ""Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I
  found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe
  was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the
  results of the Maekawa report,"" he said.
      ""We explained that the process of restructuring the economy
  away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between
  domestic and external demand...Would take time,"" Saito said.
      Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial
  Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said ""I
  only know that your government, under the leadership of
  Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less
  outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa
  report which has attracted the most attention in Europe.""
      And Europeans and Americans want quick action. ""A far better
  answer than protectionism would be structural change within the
  Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And
  we hope to see changes occur in the near future,"" visiting
  Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.
      Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the
  fault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of
  change in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.
      Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business
  leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade
  problem.
      ""We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the
  Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,""
  said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.
      ""The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it
  is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their
  labour,"" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of
  Shearson Lehman Brothers.
      Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.
      Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as
  fast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled
  the country asking about this issue.
      He said People mentioned many things in line with the
  spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and
  steel industries.
      A major misunderstanding is that the private report was
  government policy. Europeans are confused about this,
  underlined by von Moltke's reference to the ""leadership"" of the
  Maekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last
  September's government programme of new economic measures.
  ""Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out
  that the government has put its signature to a programme
  designed to implement the report,"" the ambassador said.

  The largest U.S. textile maker focused
  on its own business as its competitors found merger partners,
  but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself
  into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.
      The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose
  4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and
  Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct
  stake.
      A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly
  acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover
  offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for
  Montreal-based Dominion called the report just ""rumors.""
      Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.
      Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of
  the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if
  Burlington actually came into play.
      Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,
  added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it
  was looking for a takeover in the U.S.
      Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills
  and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for
  a U.S. acquisition.
      A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer
  has been negotiating with ""many"" U.S. textile companies, but
  would not say whether Burlington was among them.
      ""There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not
  unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the
  housecleaning they've done,"" said Eileen Gormley of Thomson
  McKinnon.
      Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets
  and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs
  last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its
  operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign
  competition, Gormley said.
      ""They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,""
  said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial
  fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets
  and other fabric to the auto industry.
      ""In the past, they just spent and never realized the return
  on the outlays they did make,"" she said.
      ""You look at their record over the year, and I think
  they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the
  past,"" Gormley said.
       She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up
  from 2.01 dlrs per share.
      Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington
  at its current levels.
      Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends
  selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50
  dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings
  basis.
      Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been
  placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.
      ""After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people
  don't find him very credible anymore,"" said one arbitrager.
      Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing
  managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if
  he doesn't win the target company.
      Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky
  Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying
  Ponderosa Inc.
      The stocks of other textile makers rose along with
  Burlington.

  The European Community (EC) accused the
  United States of violating a political commitment to free trade
  through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a
  customs user fee.
      EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to the
  surveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  (GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters.
      Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in
  criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which
  import licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as to
  improve its balance of payments.
      The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules
  by restricting imports of agricultural products through an
  import licensing system. The United States asked for
  consultations with Tokyo on the issue.
      Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a
  political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers,
  pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September.
      When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to
  negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT
  surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT
  jargon as ""standstill and rollback.""
      Tran criticised Washington for the ""superfund"" tax on oil
  imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special
  machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government
  procurement list for reasons of national security.
      Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the
  policies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.
      The surveillance body will send a record of today's talks
  to the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round,
  to decide any further action on the charges.
      The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the
  subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the
  Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.
      The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel's
  report and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports
  breached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify its
  legislation.
      Mexico and Canada, along with the European Community,

  The Zambian government today announced
  minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new
  economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the
  northern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.
      However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,
  were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could
  provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more
  sweeping reductions.
      Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the
  small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on
  items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.
      Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said
  government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.
      In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign
  of troops or police reinforcements on the streets.
      President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take
  account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the
  kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.
      The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic
  strategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerity

test/17036,Economics,1,"FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY
  U.S. banking data released today are
  too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary
  policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the
  Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,
  economists said.
      ""It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount
  window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate
  average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent
  with a modest tightening,"" said Dana Johnson of First Chicago
  Corp.
      Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that
  the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.
      Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were
  935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week
  statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of
  December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.
      Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion
  dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this
  year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the
  Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in
  reserves than the Fed had anticipated.
      However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed
  is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than
  witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have
  forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.
      First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week
  ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,
  partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the
  proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to
  pay annual income taxes.
      As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the
  reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.
      Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion
  dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists
  said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the
  projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to
  add reserves too late.
      Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently
  left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which
  to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists
  said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos
  outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add
  even more reserves but was prevented from doing so.
      ""It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as
  much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,""
  said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.
      McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting
  discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,
  equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.
      After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not
  tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,
  economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging 
  overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the
  statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.
      Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that
  the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's
  figures, he said, ""It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving
  toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture.""
      Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8
  pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate
  unless the dollar's fall gathers pace.
      Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political
  opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time
  when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to
  reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.

  Reichhold Chemical Inc said its
  board adopted a warrant dividend plan in which one preferred
  stock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on each
  common share outstanding.
      The company said its warrant dividend plan is designed to
  protect its shareholders against unsolicted, coercive attempts
  to aquire control without making an adequate offer for all
  shares.
      Reichhold said the adoption is not a response to any
  specific takeover attempt.
      Reichhold said each right will entitle shareholders to buy
  one one-hundreth of a share of a newly created series of
  preferred stock at an initial exercise price of 120 dlrs, with
  dividend and voting rights approximately equal to those of one
  share of the company's common stock.
      The rights will be exercisable only if, without Reichhold's
  prior consent, a person or group a acquires 20 pct or more of
  the voting power or announces a tender offer which would result
  in 20 pct ownership, the company said.
      Reichhold said it is entitled to redeem the rights at five
  cts apiece before a 20 pct position has been acquired, or
  before an existing 20 pct shareholder buys an additional two
  pct or more of the voting power of the company, or in
  connection with certain transactions afterward.
      The tax-free distribution will become effective May 1,

  Japan is seeking to prevent its computer
  chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale
  trade war, government officials said.
      ""We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have
  an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United
  States,"" a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
  official said.
       On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300
  mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's
  alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact.
      That agreement, reached last year after heated
  negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips
  in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.
      Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the
  fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime
  Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the
  end of April.
      While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure
  the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures
  it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure
  the trip's success, they said.
      ""The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,""
  one official told Reuters. ""We would very much like to do
  something to respond to that.""
      In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from
  spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the
  U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor
  makers, not to the government.
      Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an
  angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been
  forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor
  dispute, trade analysts said.
      They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest
  chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the
  draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact,
  included enforced production cuts.
      The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the
  announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties
  the government faces in taking further action.
      ""Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the
  U.S./Japan agreement,"" said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the
  Electronic Industries Association of Japan.
      He accused the U.S. Of being ""irrational."" He said the U.S.
  Action had made the bilateral chip pact ""meaningless.""
      Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute
  through consultations.
      Japan is expected to send a high-level official to
  Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to
  go ahead with the tariffs on April 17.
      Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry
  plans to step up purchases of U.S. Chips and to propose a joint
  investigation into Washington's allegations of chip dumping.

test/16158,Economics,1,"INSTITUTES DIVIDED ON OUTLOOK FOR GERMAN ECONOMY
  The five leading West German economic
  research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the
  domestic economy will expand this year but revised down
  forecasts contained in a report published six months ago.
      The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essen
  predicted in the institutes' joint spring report that gross
  national product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, compared
  with 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecast
  three pct 1987 growth in October last year.
      Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin
  and Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.
      The joint report said that the estimates of economic
  development made by the DIW and Ifo were ""markedly less
  favourable"" than those of the other three.
      The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a
  slow start to the year. ""In the second half of 1987 there will,
  however, only be a weak upward movement,"" they said.
      The two institutes said external economic factors which
  were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would
  dominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw
  exports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no
  marked improvement in the course of the year.
      The other three institutes, however, wrote: ""The decline in
  demand and production (seen) in the winter months does not
  indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.""
      They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate
  uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.
  But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled
  but only put off. ""It can be presumed that the braking actions
  (on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.""
      They added: ""The domestic prerequisites for a continuation
  of the economic uptrend are still favourable.""
      These three institutes said diminishing external burdens
  combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in
  demand and production could be expected by the spring.
      However, this projection was clouded by risks including the
  further development of the mark against the dollar.
      Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that
  while exports would continue to be the weak point of the
  economy in 1987, ""there is good reason to believe that exports
  will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during
  the course of the year."" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall
  in exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.
      The three more positive institutes saw private consumption
  rising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,
  while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.
      They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but
  predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in
  1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.
      All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in
  unemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the
  jobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23
  mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in
  work of about 200,000.
      These three institutes said new jobs would be created
  mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in
  the context of job creation measures. The construction industry
  was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980
  but they predicted either no rise in employment in the
  manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.
      The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only
  in the tertiary sector, while ""the number employed in the
  manufacturing industry will decline.""
      The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to
  2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.
      They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58
  billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a
  current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks
  and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around
  100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.
      The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to
  rise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five
  predicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.

  Iran is preparing lawsuits to file for

      The lawsuits would be filed with competent international

  damage from the U.S. Raid at about 500 mln dlrs.

  destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after
  the attack, he said.
      Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was

  a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle
  City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
      He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs
  ""except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence."" Reacting to

  dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by &lt;Merrill Lynch
  Capital Partners Inc>.
      Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a
  definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the
  new company, &lt;AV Holdings Corp>, will begin a 48.50 dlr per
  share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of
  Borg-Warner common stock.
      The offer will be followed by a merger in which each
  remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and
  54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated
  discount debentures.
      As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly
  owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said
  members of management do not plan to participate in the
  transaction, but they will retain their positions with the
  company.
      A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds
  19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares.
      GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share.
      Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to
  sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo
  security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
      Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for
  about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed
  a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the
  stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup
  values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and
  speculated an offer would have to be sweetened.
      In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the
  Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their
  shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its
  advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co.
      James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,
  said, ""We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction
  with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the
  employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its
  strong presence in the Chicago community.""
      Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer,
  which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject
  to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing
  arrangements.
      The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or
  51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered.
      Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to
  provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in
  subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments.
      Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with
  commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the
  financing required to complete the transaction.
      The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in
  the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying
  cash interest after five years.
      The debentures will be redeemable at the company's option
  for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at
  102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.
      The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity
  of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in
  the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before
  maturity.
      Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50
  dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per
  share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first
  convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock.
      The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its
  poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right,
  effective immediately.

  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has
  withdrawn a request to Washington to suspend operations at an
  American army base near Athens as a Greek-Turkish row over oil
  rights in the Aegean eased.
      A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened to
  tackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea kept
  to Turkish territorial waters yesterday, avoiding a potential
  clash.
      Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefing
  opposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday.
      The Greek government later withdrew Friday's request to
  Washington to close down its telecommunications base at Nea
  Makri, north of Athens, saying that the reasons which had
  prompted it to make the request were no longer valid.
      Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece has
  the right to ask for suspension of operations at times when its
  national interests are threatened.
      The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it would
  search for oil round three Greek islands off its coast
  following an announcement from Greece that it planned to drill
  east of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-led
  oil consortium operating in the northern Aegean.
      Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreement
  under which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in the
  Aegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled.
  Athens says it considers the accord inactive.
      The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had
  received an assurance from Greece that it would not carry out
  oil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declined
  comment on the statement.
      Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take the
  long-standing continental shelf dispute to the International
  Court of Justice at The Hague.
      Conservative opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis said
  he had urged Papandreou to accept an offer from NATO General
  Secretary Lord Carrington to help resolve the row.

  Hungary has announced sharp price
  increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of

      The official MTI news agency said the government decided
  consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state
  spending. From today the price of meat will rise by an average
  18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said.
      MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive,
  with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also
  announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including
  higher pensions and family allowances.
      Statistics indicate the budget deficit tripled in 1986 to
  47 billion forints. Central banker Janos Fekete has said the
  Finance Ministry is trying to cut the 1987 shortfall to between
  30 and 35 billion from a planned 43.8 billion.

  The buffer stock rules agreement reached
  on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) is an
  improvement on previous arrangements but the price-support
  mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa
  prices, many ICCO delegates and trade sources said.
      The accord was reached between producers and consumers of
  the 35-member ICCO council after two weeks of talks.
      European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the
  accord may boost cocoa prices immediately, but world surpluses
  overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long.
      ""If the buffer stock operation is successful, I doubt it
  will do anything more than stop the price from falling further,
  and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate
  prices,"" a European dealer said.
      And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying,
  or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market
  is relying on him to do so, the bearish trade reaction could
  pressure prices dramatically, dealers said.
      The buffer stock is the market-regulating tool of the ICCO,
  into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to
  manoeuvre prices into a pre-set stabilization range.
      A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but
  delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time.
      The new rules take effect immediately. The buffer stock
  manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three
  weeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producing
  countries and assessing the market, since prices are below the
  ""must-buy"" level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne
  specified in the agreement, the sources said.
      The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum
  100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach will
  be more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said.
      The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a
  buying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes of
  which are already in the buffer stock.
      ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister
  Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of
  stabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa
  producer.
      ""We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw
  immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market,"" Bra Kanon
  told reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckoned
  the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000
  tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee.
      However, some producer and consumer members emerged from
  the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the
  pact.
      Ghana, whose high-quality cocoa is the world's most
  expensive and provides 60 pct of the country's export earnings,
  made a formal protest to the council about the price
  differentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too high
  for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock.
      According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West
  Germany, ""Consumers weren't perfectly happy with the buffer
  stock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...There
  were no real winners or losers.""
      Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that
  important points were fully discussed during the talks, and as
  a result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as
  effectively as they could have, delegates said.
      Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seek
  offers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials to
  reflect different qualities. Non-ICCO member cocoa can comprise
  up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock.
      London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg per
  tonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stg
  in January 1986.
      A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000
  tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session
  decides market conditions warrant it, according to the
  agreement.
      The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall
  below the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five
  days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has
  been filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says.
      The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an
  executive committee meeting on June 9/12, ICCO officials said.

  Venezuela's central bank has ordered
  Venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange
  operations with brokers based outside the country, according to
  a copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters.
      The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has
  effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's
  volatile currency market.
      The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez
  Delfino, manager of the bank's department of international
  operations.
      The telex said the restriction on business with foreign
  brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign
  exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign
  currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.
      In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied
  rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to
  prop up the weakening bolivar.
      But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de
  facto currency control. ""It is definitely a control in the sense
  that there's no longer complete freedom to operate,"" one broker
  here said.
      ""Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction
  is towards complete control,"" the broker said.
      The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his
  Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since
  the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with
  telephone calls.
      He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume
  of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs
  a day. ""It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active,"" he
  said.
      The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the
  prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary
  between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.
      ""We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's
  ridiculous,"" he said. ""They've been on a rampage against
  foreigners.""
      The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central
  bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange
  business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct
  reserve requirement.
      In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in
  bolivar futures, the broker said.
      ""We used to have a forward market,"" he said. ""For a small
  currency it was miraculous.""
      He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.
  Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range
  of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running

  Finance ministers from seven major
  industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize
  currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to
  reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth.
      In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the
  U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the
  value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct
  now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to
  boost their economy.
      West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it
  a ""good meeting"" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters
  other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome.
      Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign
  exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened
  again to prevent the yen rising too quickly.
      The communique said, ""The ministers and governors reaffirmed
  the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent
  Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will
  be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
  global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances.""
      It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling
  Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the
  communique termed ""extraordinary and urgent measures"" including
  an ""unprecedented front-end loading of public works
  expenditures.""
      The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought
  together ministers and central bank governors of the seven
  major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West
  Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
      The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment
  on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris
  when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the
  then-current levels.
      In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall
  against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by
  the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at
  around postwar lows.
      Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United
  States and European countries for its only modest efforts to
  open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its
  exports.
      The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open
  domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not
  elaborate.
      It said the officials ""reaffirmed the view that around
  current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly
  consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
  intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.""

  A high level U.S. trade official
  said it would be foolish for Japan to strike back against the
  United States for its sanctions on Japanese semiconductor
  electronics products.
      Asked by reporters if Japan was expected to retaliate
  against U.S. exports, Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce Bruce
  Smart replied, ""That would be the height of foolishness.""
      In addition, he doubted Japan could show enough progress in
  meeting the conditions of the agreement to avoid the actual
  imposition of the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on April 17.
      Japan's 58.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United
  States last year has come under fire in Congress concerned
  about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the
  record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986.
      President Reagan's sanctions decision won praise today from
  the two Democratic leaders of Congress.
      ""I think it's about time,"" Senate Democratic Leader Robert
  Byrd of West Virginia told reporters. House Speaker Jim Wright
  of Texas told reporters before the opening of the House
  session, ""It just shows we were right all along when we said
  something needs doing.""
      Smart testified before a Senate Labor Committee hearing
  that last Friday's U.S. trade action would help U.S.
  negotiations on access to Japan for U.S. auto parts.
      Since last August Smart has been leading talks to open up
  Japan to purchases of more U.S.-made automotive parts. Last
  year, Japan racked up a 3.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the
  United States in these products.
      Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987.
      ""It's amazing to me that the Japanese were surprised. I
  hope it will persuade them we're serious,"" Smart said of the
  White House trade sanctions.
      The United States has tried to convince Japanese car
  companies of the quality of American-made parts and to draw
  them away from their traditional Japanese suppliers.
      ""All we ask is a chance. We have a job to do persuading them
  we can do better than our reputation seems to be,"" he said.
      Measured per car, each American-made car contained about
  700 dlrs in Japanese auto parts while each Japanese-made car
  contained about 26 dlrs in U.S. auto parts, Smart said.

  The United States is prepared to ""pull out
  all the stops"" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador
  to GATT Michael Samuels said.
      Those rights are now being challenged by the European
  Community's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a
  conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.
      He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if
  the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without
  the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.
      The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect
  on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat
  shipments into the EC.
      The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.
  trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed
  prices over the current market level and which may be extended
  to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.
      Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,
  an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade
  negotiations, ""is meaningless if import barriers continue to be
  erected,"" Samuels said.
      Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm
  subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, ""visionary""
  and ""very serious.""  The EC and Japan have said it is
  unrealistic.
      The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal
  on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally
  next week.
      The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce
  tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals
  substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of
  farm subsidies.
      The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as
  they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major
  trade distortions, Samuels said.
      Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally
  submitted and respond to it officially then.
      ""We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este
  declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,""
  the U.S. Ambassador said.
      The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores
  the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.
      The key difference between the two approaches is that the
  U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing
  only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.
      If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,
  there would be little incentive for the Community to work to
  correct the international trade situation, he added.
      Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC
  oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to
  third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the
  U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

  The Soviet Union outlined its economic
  targets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improve
  standards in the country's sluggish engineering industry.
      Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet
  industrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a
  planned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.
      Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent
  to gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against a
  planned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures the
  output of a country's goods and services.
      He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of
  grain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscow
  produced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.
      Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described
  machine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is
  essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on
  world markets.
      ""Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the
  machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a
  considerable amount of the equipment that it requires,"" said
  Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.
      Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes
  machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,
  increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987
  compared with the same period last year.
      However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase planned
  for the industry for the whole of 1988.
      Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent
  meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to
  a large extent on conserving resources better. ""Large-scale
  measures are planned to save resources,"" he said.
      Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that
  defense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the same
  figure as was announced last year.
      Western governments view official Soviet estimates for
  defense spending as highly understated, but say the real figure
  is hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are
  intertwined with the civilian economy.
      Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spending
  next year on medical services, education, pensions and social
  insurance schemes.

  Amoco Corp is apparently the successful

      The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to the
  negotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night with
  TransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3
  billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets.
      No financial details about the Amoco offer were available
  and a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amoco
  had emerged the winner, the newspaper said.
      However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Dome
  could be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe and
  Mail said.
      Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available for
  comment.
      Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Dome
  said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused
  to identify them.
      Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco and
  Exxon Corp's &lt;XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary in
  Canada.
      British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD>
  have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome.
      In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured by
  the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,
  the only Canadian company in the bidding.
      Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want
  to avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the government
  gave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to
  encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts and
  officials have said.
      A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run
  afoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada is
  asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is
  trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs,
  analysts have said.
      A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreign
  oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry.
      Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company,
  with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based
  Amoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its Amoco

  prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose
  great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price
  and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.
      They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference
  presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances
  about price differentials making some of their crudes
  uncompetitive.
      There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that
  OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,
  to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.
      But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price
  differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market
  signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.
      ""All OPEC members can make a good case for changing
  differentials,"" said one analyst with a major oil company. ""But
  at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be ""leave well
  alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.""
      Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw
  sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished
  customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,
  marketing incentives have helped their sales.
      Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by
  means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside
  better priced grades in a ""package.""
      Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least
  for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should
  change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for
  fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At
  its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed
  prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference
  point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985
  when members offered discounts to attract customers.
      OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8
  mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter
  and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend
  or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.
      Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not
  mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr
  target and at most make minimal changes to differentials,
  analysts say.
      The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one
  non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export
  crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.
  Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.
      Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil
  exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say
  only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at
  official prices, with some of the rest included in processing
  or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.
      Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,
  when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to
  pay the new prices.
     Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude
  -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --
  was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.
      In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below
  its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,
  due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has
  risen.
      Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say
  its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.
      But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort
  Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the
  differentials question in Vienna.
      ""It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which
  holds the presidency, raised the issue,"" he said.

  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
  said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation
  of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German
  economic growth.
      In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs
  here, Poehl said ""It would be an extremely risky policy to aim
  for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to
  correct the trade deficit.""
      He said the United States could face a vicious circle of
  depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that
  route.
      Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet
  U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,
  accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating
  above-target money supply growth.
      He said he would have been happy to have brought forward
  five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to
  the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced
  political constraints getting such measures through the upper
  house of the West German parliament.
      But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could
  accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.
      Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about
  one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial
  erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing
  demand at home.
      ""A further appreciation of the mark could even be an
  obstacle to further growth,"" he said.
      Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply
  growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and
  because external factors, including low oil prices and
  favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.
      But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma
  over monetary policy.
      The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the
  reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany
  was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.
      ""For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more
  on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary
  money supply. But we must be very careful,"" he said.
      He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's
  trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as
  the United States.
      Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary
  officials of major industrialized countries, saying the
  importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange
  rates had been underestimated.
      All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the
  right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he
  said.
      ""This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the
  part of our American colleagues,"" he said.
      But he said there was still a danger that the correction of
  the dollar's value could overshoot.

  Japanese trade figures are seriously
  challenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Group
  of Seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates
  are the key to smoothing world trade problems.
      Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo say
  they are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currencies
  are the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japan
  shrinking?
      What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down
  made world trade problems worse rather than solving them,
  fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast of
  world trade recession?
      U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar
  fall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five
  pact in New York.
      The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pct
  more competitive in Japan. The officials, most of them
  economists, can offer no objective reason why they are not.
      Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan rising
  rapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined
  only 11 pct against the yen.?
      Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely
  interpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar
  must go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct?
      At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials can
  only offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.
      ""I don't know and I don't think anyone knows,"" said Hugh
  Richardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo.
      ""What I do know is that Community exporters are making a
  hell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, there
  is money to be made in Japan,"" he added.
      But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S.
  Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive trade
  practices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such as
  agriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonable
  checking and customs procedures for car imports.
      Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in the
  face of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, they
  blame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive.
      ""We see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,""
  said a senior official, who declined to be named. ""We like to
  refrain from accusing them of not making enough effort.""
      Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito, chairman of the
  Keidanren business group, and Sony Corp chairman Akio Morita
  repeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to
  understand Japan's markets, and some foreigners agree. ""The real

  GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-Warner
  Corp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to
  be preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company.
       Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for
  4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch
  Capital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for
  89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and
  securities for the balance.
      Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.
      ""I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in
  with another bid,"" said one analyst, who values the company at
  51 or 52 dlrs per share.
      GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of
  Borg-Warner's stock.
      ""You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up
  the price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have
  to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking
  at it - that it's worth more,"" Pershing and Co analyst Richard
  Henderson said.
      Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.
      GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill
  Lynch officials did not return phone calls.
      Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman
  sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics
  business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as
  telephones, computer terminals, and appliances.
      ""Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical
  operation these days,"" said Henderson.
      ""He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he
  does not like to get pushed around,"" said Henderson.
      GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover
  of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF
  did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its
  investment in Carbide.
      Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its
  Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer
  and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would
  give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.
      ""It's a win-win situation,"" said one analyst.
      One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be
  forthcoming shortly.
      ""I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this
  book,"" he said.
      Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,
  protective services, which includes Wells Fargo security
  guards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
      Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows
  GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it
  would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per
  share.
      ""I think there's a probability he goes up in price,"" said
  Rose.
      Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman
  would do. ""Sam's a low-risk, high-return player.""
      ""Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical
  enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,"" Rose
  said.
      Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add
  earnings momentum to GAF. ""I worked out that paying as much as
  50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if
  they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,"" said John
  Henry of E.F. Hutton.
      Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986
  operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion
  dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net
  earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.

  An income tax surcharge and capital
  gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of
  the N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.
      Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the
  Bank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to
  restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by
  current government policies.
      The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn
  would lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.
  He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could
  be much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.
      Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a
  percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was
  probably unavoidable, Bayliss said.
      He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct
  value-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,
  but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.
  Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary
  impact of a currency depreciation.
      The government had failed to bring inflation down despite
  lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.
      New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to
  end-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.
      The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation
  policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and
  insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss
  said. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt
  and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.
      ""The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are
  going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought
  is soundly based -- primarily because the government's

training/10632,Markets,2,"BANK SEES MODEST RECOVERY IN GULF ARAB ECONOMIES
  The Emirates Industrial Bank has
  predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states
  following higher oil revenues.
      A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said
  total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
  countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from
  33.5 billion in 1986.
      The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia
  and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
      The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil
  prices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain
  overall group production.
      These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight
  dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs.
      ""All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in
  the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected
  growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,""
  the study said.
      It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher
  budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past
  recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts.
      The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise
  to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year.
      It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined
  trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in
  1985.
      The UAE suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic product
  to 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985, it

  The United States' dependency on
  foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,
  according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry
  Research Associates.
      Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference
  here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much
  as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high
  level of 47 pct in 1977.
      ""The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is
  inevitable,"" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil
  imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.
      Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for
  33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to
  40 pct by 1990.
      ""However, the rate of this growth can be affected
  positively or negatively through government action or
  inaction,"" Lichtblau said.
      He said that one of the government's negative actions is
  the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a
  disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash
  flow for oil exploration.
      Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor
  price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.
      ""An international floor price adopted by all or most
  industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective
  measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if
  we imposed it alone,"" Lichtblau said.
      Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic
  fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen
  U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.
      A potential for alternative supplies could limit the
  willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.
      Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer
  tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic
  Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans
  for alternative energy.

test/17966,Economics,1,"U.K. RESERVES LIFT HOPES OF FURTHER BASE RATE CUT
  The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K.
  Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for a
  further cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11
  general election, market analysts said.
      Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected
  number but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.
      But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now
  available to the authorities to support the pound should curb
  any market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show the
  ruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added.
      ""We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than
  we have done hitherto,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
  said at a news conference today, commenting on the news of the
  record reserves rise.
      He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvre
  accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the
  dollar, partly through direct intervention on foreign
  exchanges. ""We have been playing a very full part ourselves,"" he
  said.
      But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on
  sterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp down
  its rise, more in the light of local factors.
      Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities,
  said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain
  amid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears last
  autumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out.
      U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign
  buyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields as
  attractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notably
  equities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.
      Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower
  interest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse
  the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.
      Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves
  news, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of
  currencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0
  pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.
      ""The market doesn't want to do anything because of the
  election,"" commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.
      Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of
  a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had
  overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to
  have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the
  forward market.
      The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of
  sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth
  the pound's sudden downturn, while some of the intervention
  reported in May probably occurred in April, they said.
      The key three months interbank money market rates eased
  about 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend
  in U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reserves
  news, analysts said.
      Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was
  muted as traders worried about the funding implications of
  another huge rise in reserves, they added.
      Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cut
  from the current nine pct level soon after the election, so
  long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove
  accurate, with another half point later.
      Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit Suisse
  Buckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might be
  possible. ""Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in
  future, rather than this active intervention,"" he predicted.
      Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned
  against over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut
  looked likely.
      A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.
      ""The Bank (of England) is both worried about the political
  problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... And
  has signalled some worry about broad money (growth),"" said Robin
  Marshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities.
      He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in
  the past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into the
  European Monetary System.
      But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10
  or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did
  so. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in.

  Bank's purchases as modest, perhaps amounting to no more than
  20 or 30 mln dlrs.
      The Bank of France, which was reported buying dollars
  against the yen in Paris, had made inquiries with Swiss banks
  as well, and the Bundesbank had also intervened. Bank of Japan
  dollar purchases today were perhaps 1.2 to 1.5 billion dlrs.
      Dealers said this tended to confirm the market's impression
  that major industrial countries had agreed at the Paris meeting

  seemed ready to test it.
      Commercial clients were also selling dollars against the
  yen as the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 drew
  closer. Today's dealings in spot currencies are booked for
  March 31.
      One dealer said he had the feeling Japanese companies had
  been asked by the Bank of Japan not to sell dollars at this
  point, but some, while sticking to the letter of that request,
  were offering dollars forward today, rather than lose out if
  the dollar fell further.
      The run on the dollar against the yen came in a market
  thinned by the absence of many dealers for a Forex Club meeting
  in Hamburg.
      Trading was, in fact, rather light against currencies other
  than the yen, the dollar holding little changed through the

  The Soviet economy has grown at an

  goals may be too ambitious, according to a report from U.S.
  intelligence agencies.
      The report was prepared jointly by the Central Intelligence
  Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency for the
  Congressional Joint Economic committee, which released it.
      It said the Soviet economy grew by 4.2 pct in 1986,
  Gorbachev's first full year in power, twice the average rate of
  growth over the previous 10 years.
      Gorbachev's policies to improve worker attitudes, remove
  incompetent officials, reduce corruption and alcoholism and
  modernize the country's industrial equipment accounted for some
  of the gains, the report said.
      ""Although many of the specific policies Gorbachev has
  adopted are not new, the intensity Gorbachev has brought to his
  efforts and his apparent commitment to finding long-term
  solutions are attributes that his immediate predecessors
  lacked. Nonetheless, Gorbachev's program appears too ambitious
  on a number of counts,"" the report said.
      Earlier this week, two U.S. experts on the Soviet Union
  said Gorbachev was likely to be ousted in three to four years
  if he continues his reform policies.
      ""I don't think he can last four years,"" Marshall Goldman of
  Harvard University told a Congressional hearing. ""He's moving so
  fast, he's stepping on so many toes.""
      A similar comment came from Peter Reddaway of the
  Smithsonian Institution's Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian
  studies.
      The economic report said meeting targets for commodity
  output would require unrealistic gains in productivity and
  industrial output targets appear too high to allow time to
  install more advanced equipment.
      None of Gorbachev's proposals would change the system of
  economic incentives that has discouraged innovation and
  technological change, the report added.
      ""The first significant resistance to specific policies,
  although not overall goals, surfaced (in 1986) in both the
  massive government and party bureaucracy, particularly among
  enterprise managers who complained that they were being asked
  to carry out conflicting goals -- such as to raise quality
  standards and output targets simultaneously,"" the report said.

      Willy de Clercq, External Relations Commissioner of the

  entering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity and
  the expectation that China will practice an open-trade policy
  without trade discrimination, de Clercq added.
      De Clercq noted the different dimensions of the Chinese
  economy and those of Hungary and Yugoslavia, the two current

  Portugal's economy, which has been
  enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade,
  may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latest
  government crisis, analysts said.
      But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco
  Silva's government could slow economic reforms and investment
  as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European
  Community, which it joined in January last year, they said.
      Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, was
  toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.
      The centre-right administration had made economic growth
  reform a priority in its 17 months in office.
      In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its current
  account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and
  inflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.
      Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability
  were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued
  growth had not been badly shaken.
      ""The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is
  now less dependent on the political situation,"" said Fritz
  Haser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.
      ""The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet,"" economist
  Jorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters.
      Businessmen have identified political instability over the
  last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting
  economic progress.
      The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974
  revolution.
      Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remain
  buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge
  in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely
  underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.
      Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of
  Portugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell,
  predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth
  would remain at similar levels this year.
      But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies
  and could slow economic development.
      Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end
  of the month, can either call early elections or form a new
  government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated
  parliament.
      Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick
  elections as the best solution. ""There is a good chance that a
  majority government could result from early elections,""
  Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro
  Ferraz da Costa said.
      He said they were optimistic this could mean the
  continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies
  introduced over the last year.
      The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but
  the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls
  say they could win an overall majority.
      A PSD majority would also open the way for more
  wide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and
  possible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.
      Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties
  of blocking key economic reforms.
      The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic results
  were more the product of favourable international conditions
  such as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD
  policies.

      The Mainichi Shimbun quoted Nippon Steel as saying that

  Federal Reserve data released today
  indicate that there has been no policy change in recent weeks
  and that none is likely at next week's Federal Open Market
  Committee (FOMC) meeting, economists said.
      ""The Fed continues to be accommodative in its provision of
  reserves, indicating that there has been no policy shift since
  the beginning of this year,"" said Harold Nathan, economist at
  Wells Fargo Bank.
      ""These numbers and other things suggest the FOMC will not
  change policy,"" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co.
      ""The Fed is sitting fairly pretty now. There's no real
  reason for it to change policy,"" said Joseph Liro of S.G.
  Warburg and Co Inc.
      Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does
  not require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates
  may well end March at the bottom of their target ranges.
      All of the economists agreed that the Fed's major concern
  now is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was
  heavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurting
  the dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering
  interest rates further.
      Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with
  expectations and similar to the data for most of this year.
      The Fed said that banks' net free reserves averaged 603 mln
  dlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesday
  versus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period.
      In the single week to Wednesday, banks' borrowings at the
  discount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrs
  compared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement
  period. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to
  6.14 pct from 6.08 pct.
      The Fed's failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday
  and Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data
  released today suggest it had no real need to add reserves.
      The Fed's absence may be explained by the lack of any
  pressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to
  boost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to
  meet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg.
      Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-week
  borrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually
  averaged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that
  was up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period.
      Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for
  two-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln
  dlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of
  around 6.10 pct.
      It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings
  target since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said
  Wells Fargo's Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on
  the funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to
  6-1/4 pct band.
      Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding need
  are anticipated for the statement period that began today.
   More
      Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four
  billion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro
  puts the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs.
      To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to
  add permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to
  buy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar
  coupon ""pass"" may be required later.
      There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement
  period because it includes the close of the quarter. Further
  upward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window
  dressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31.

test/19191,Economics,1,"U.K. LENDERS OFFER MORE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES
  More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers
  fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes
  the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other
  interest rates.
      And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in
  years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers
  trying to lock into cheap money.
      The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials
  said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home
  mortgage business.
      While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They
  were the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a
  few years ago.
      But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,
  mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low
  as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their
  portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to
  induce them to retain their accounts.
      As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were
  forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose
  rates would move in line with the cost of funds.
      ""We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,""
  said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,
  explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only
  offering variable rate mortgages.
      The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped
  homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders
  concede they are being forced to undercut each other still
  more.
      Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier
  this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by
  National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for
  new business, officials at all three institutions said.
      The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even
  below those on the variable rate loans.
      ""Of course they are less profitable than other (variable
  rate) mortgages,"" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which
  earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate
  new mortgage loans.
      But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable
  loans because, ""It was just another way to attract people to our
  mortgage product.""
      Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed
  rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.
      The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was
  exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.
      ""Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,"" she said, noting
  that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct
  of its 1986 volume.
      In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they
  offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest
  rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the
  lender is earning an above average return on assets.
      But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won
  the benefit of cheap money.
      Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed
  rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption
  that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates
  fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.
      Young explained that the company had planned to protect
  itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a
  complicated hedging instrument.
      But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations
  and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He
  said money market rates were too high to arrange both the
  mortgages and hedge profitably.
      However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does
  make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This
  means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond
  and selling them to an investor.
      For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more
  efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate
  mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular
  again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money
  over the past few years.

training/2228,Economics,1,"BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT
  The Bank of England again fought against
  money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate
  cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise
  in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high.
      It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct
  of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued
  to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and
  the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said.
      Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can
  stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want
  to.
      The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants
  rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when
  it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to
  relieve a money market shortage.
      ""They're really making the discount houses suffer,"" said
  Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew.
  ""Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates.""
      This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by
  any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had
  inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came
  strongly into the pound.
      The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London
  close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60
  marks, up from 2.8720/50.
      ""If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that
  rates could drop before the Budget,"" said Jeremy Hale, economist
  at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp.
      Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the
  base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.
      However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be
  convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating
  rather than a result of short-term speculative gains.
      There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said
  Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co.
      Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of
  a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and
  disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to
  hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback
  for bonds, Fellner said.
      An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most
  forecasts say it will be this year.
      Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to
  oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar.
      However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set
  the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether.
      The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable
  rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there.
      Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least
  a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term
  capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan.
      They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet
  than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and
  current political upheavals in Washington.
      The Bank may want to see another few points on the
  trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. ""But by
  then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of
  England,"" he added.
      The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting
  pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources
  said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more
  than just marking up by foreign exchange traders.
      Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially
  harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that
  the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.
      This was above previous estimates of the current account
  deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.
      Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would
  have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they
  were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.
      The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing
  banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank
  officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this
  week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.
  If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point
  cut, with another half or full point about Budget day.

  The Institute for Economic Research
  (WIFO) said it has cut its forecast for Austria's 1987 gross
  domestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pct
  forecast made last December.
      WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he saw
  the one pct figure, which compares with 1.8 pct last year, as
  the upper limit of growth. The institute had made the revision
  due to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added.
      A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oil
  producing states, combined with the effects of the dollar's
  fall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year.
      Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth this
  year. After last year's 2.8 pct rise in real incomes, private
  consumption was likely to rise 2.25 pct in 1987 after 1.9 pct
  in 1986, despite a present trend towards higher savings.
      Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 5.2
  pct last year due to the slack economic activity.
      Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficit
  of about four billion schillings compared with a 2.6 billion
  surplus recorded last year. The National Bank, Austria's
  central bank, last month forecast the current account would be
  roughly in balance this year.
      However, Kramer said the lower economic growth should have
  no notable effect on the government's attempts to cut the
  budget deficit. This year's aim of reducing the deficit to 4.9
  pct of GDP from 5.1 pct in 1986 could still be achieved, he
  said.

  President Reagan today is to
  announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to
  retaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfair
  practices in semiconductor trade.
      The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of
  Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of
  experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.
      Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs
  on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors
  and television sets to power tools and photographic film.
      The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some
  20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa
  Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing.
      In his March annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed to
  full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide
  American industry with free and fair trade opportunities.""
      He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the
  pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world
  markets and opened its home market to U.S. products.
      U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March
  announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions.
      White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  ""we
  do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of
  action that requires meaningful action.""
      Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits,
  with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion.
      About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.
      Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to
  retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.
      He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent
  negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that
  existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.
      Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was
  as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not
  need any new trade legislation.
      The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring
  the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the
  results showed up.
      U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of
  Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and
  Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the
  Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports.
      Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would
  file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade
  (GATT).
      It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had
  violated the regulations of the global trading group and would
  approve compensation or Japanese retaliation.
      U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would
  retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with
  the United States.

  a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March
  17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the
  Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures.
      However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable
  climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and
  allow a half-point cut.
      Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market
  as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early
  rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling.
      Most market participants believe that Lawson will now
  foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time
  of the budget, although one or two said they would not be
  surprised to see a full point decline at this stage.
      Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts
  last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued
  a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the
  Government bond market.
      To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold
  out within hours of becoming available for trading and the
  market pushed on to register further sharp gains.
      Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the
  issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as
  rapidly as last week's.
      However, they noted that although sterling had edged down
  from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed
  on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final
  71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300
  GMT.

  Fritz Leutwiler, chairman of

  achieving a rising rate for the mark against the Swiss franc.
      In a speech to shareholders, Leutwiler said, ""A gradually

  desirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and with
  regard to sustaining Swiss industry.""
      ""Simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank of

  target of monetary stability.
      ""Bringing the franc close to the mark would, of course, have

      The spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market,
  not the central bank, and it would be impossible to influence
  individual parities separately.
      Leutwiler said the Swiss National Bank could not support
  the value of the dollar, even in conjunction with other central
  banks, without putting monetary stability in jeopardy.
      ""I would be the last to recommend that. The key to a

test/17883,Economics,1,"NO REASON TO CUT RATES - BUNDESBANK'S SCHLESINGER
  Bundesbank vice president Helmut
  Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.
      With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in
  May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,
  Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that a
  further cut in interest rates was needed.
      The economy is picking up, after contracting by a
  seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from
  the fourth, he added. ""We may have an increase in gnp starting
  in the second quarter,"" he said in an interview.
      Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has been
  pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its
  imports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.
      Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was
  mainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in
  1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.
      He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole
  would probably be between one and two pct.
     ""It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic
  demand does not grow strongly,"" he said, noting that interest
  rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.
      Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money
  stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace
  of 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to six
  pct target.
      He said the target could still be achieved but much will
  depend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavy
  inflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS
  revaluation, boosted domestic money supply.
      ""There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of
  foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit
  reversed,"" Schlesinger said.
      A major reason for the inflows was the market's conviction
  that the mark was headed higher. ""As we can see from the market,
  expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have
  diminished,"" Schlesinger said.
      The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the
  fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period
  and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined
  towards stabilizing the dollar, he said.
      Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar
  rise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87
  marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.
      At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.
      ""Central banks are always in contact about these
  fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,""
  Schelsinger said.
      ""One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,"" he said,
  adding, ""It is not only our own case, it is also the American
  case.""
      He said that the West German export industry has been hit
  hard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to see
  some correction now. ""But it wouldn't be good to have short-term
  fluctuations,"" he said. ""Let us wait and see.""
      ""It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very
  short period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level
  (of rates) as such,"" Schlesinger said.
      The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of
  such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West
  German inflation down year.
      Although there have recently been signs of inflation
  picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key
  commodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year would
  be unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.
      Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth
  was longer term, in that the economy was building up the
  potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.
      The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16
  months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of
  targets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the
  mid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.
      But he added: ""I don't see any great pressure to go away
  from it.""

  Taiwan announced plans for another round
  of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade
  talks with Washington which officials described as a move to
  help balance trade with the United States.
      Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's
  Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of
  products included 60 items asked by Washington.
      ""The move is part of our government efforts to encourage
  imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United
  States,"" he said.
      He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet
  that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,
  apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut
  by between five and 50 pct.
      The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday
  and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting
  on April 20, he added.
      Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700
  foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its
  growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's
  largest trading partner.
      Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and
  pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade
  deficit with Taipei.
      Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6
  billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It
  widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78
  billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.
      Today's announcement came before a departure later today of
  a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of
  trade talks with U.S. Officials.
      The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last
  night he was leaving with ""a heavy heart,"" meaning that he would
  face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist
  sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus
  with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.
      Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.

  purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,
  import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.

  Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financial
  markets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's
  wake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that
  is likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.
      For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline
  as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell
  sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.
      But that confidence is now cracking as the financial
  markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's
  often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.
      ""Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar
  freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,"" said
  David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.
      The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in
  40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington
  failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a
  credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short
  of further depreciation of the dollar.
      Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid
  worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare
  away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.
      The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12
  dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike
  in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down
  by 33 points to 2339.
      Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the
  markets' instability frightening. He believes economic
  fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that ""once
  you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.""
      ""There's a stark possibility that you could get a
  destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates
  and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.""
      Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics
  in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the
  controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and
  264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.
      ""We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But
  the agony may be fairly drawn out,"" Marris told Reuters.
      Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this
  year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it
  would take very little to touch off what he calls the second
  phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the
  dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.
      The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on
  March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.
      The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with
  historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are
  not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its
  decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.
      Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest
  weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks
  suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling
  below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as
  part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.
      Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of
  confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced
  plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic
  imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.
      Many economists believe that long-run stability will not
  return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is
  addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the
  massive budget deficit.
      But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of
  central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no
  choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.
      ""The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a
  substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding
  cut abroad, at least by Japan,"" said Lanston's Jones.
      Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest
  rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for
  American farmers, Latin American governments and others.
      But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and
  Co, scoffed at the notion. ""It's ridiculous to think the Federal
  Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak
  against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar
  weakness,"" he said.
      Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being
  made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.
      ""We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the
  budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody
  cares,"" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69
  will have been greater.
      He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and
  thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.
      But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that
  a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. ""Put on
  your helmets,"" Giordano said.

  South Korea's gross national product (GNP)

  Malaysia's recovery from the worst
  recession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when the
  government announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988
  after seven years of austerity, economists said.
      ""Our country is walking on one leg now,"" said Ismail Salleh,
  an economist with the Institute of Strategic and International
  Studies. ""It has to depend on public sector investment for
  faster growth if the private sector is not moving.""
      Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking
  one pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.
      The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under
  two pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct
  because prices for commodity exports have risen sharply.
  Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin and
  semiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.
      The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billion
  ringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.
      Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pct
  in 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.
      Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmen
  blaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.
      One businessman said too many politicians give the
  impression that Malaysia was unstable.
      ""If we can take care of investment confidence, the potential
  to recover strongly is great,"" a banker said.
      Malaysia's 1987 current account is expected to be in the
  black with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgit
  surplus compared with last year's 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.
      The government has said its fiscal policies will balance
  the budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.
      The government will also repay some of its external debt,
  which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.
      Political leaders have said the budget will not hurt
  ordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential
  goods are unlikely to change.
      Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the
  corporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia to
  compete for investors with neighbouring states.

  With more private investment, not more
  protection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitive
  with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two
  congressional agencies said today.
      The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of
  Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing
  there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S.
  textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for
  optimism than a few years ago.
      ""While textile producers are making significant
  investments, they could do more,"" OTA analyst Henry Kelly said.
      The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan
  budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan
  guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than
  increased trade protection which could lead to foreign
  retaliation.
      CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections,
  first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit for
  profits and investments of domestic firms.
      Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the
  agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against
  congressional approval of protectionist textile quota
  legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other
  Asian textile producing countries.
      President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill
  but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is
  expected to be voted on in the House this year.
      However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of
  a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles
  showed a weakening of support for the legislation.
      Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign
  producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production
  equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic
  markets, Kelly said.
      He added that private investment in the textile and
  clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh
  the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.
      Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of
  textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct
  while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.
      ""The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by
  new technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the
  industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets
  that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research
  indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered,
  and that exports can be expanded,"" Kelly said.

  exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's 9.6
  pct.
      Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production about

      However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin
  reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400
  ounces due to start-up production problems.

       IN 1986, company earnings were based an average market

  Japan today announced another mammoth
  monthly trade surplus that economists said would be sure to
  intensify already mounting pressure on the country for action.
      ""The world has every reason to be furious with Japan for not
  moving more quickly,"" Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd economist
  Eric Rasmussen said.
      The Finance Ministry said today that the trade surplus
  soared to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion in
  January and 4.77 billion a year ago.
      The current account surplus, which includes trade in
  services as well as goods, climbed to 7.38 billion dlrs last
  month from 4.95 billion in January and 3.89 billion a year ago.
      After being adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, the figures
  look a bit better, but not much. On that basis, the trade
  surplus declined slightly in February to 9.16 billion dlrs from
  a record 9.58 billion in January.
      ""In the medium term we expect this modest improvement to
  continue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward off
  further protectionism or further yen strength,"" said William
  Stirling, economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.
      A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive on
  world markets while making imports into the country cheaper.
      ""On a seasonally adjusted basis, we appear to be making some
  progress on getting exports down,"" Jardine's Rasmussen said.
      But imports do not seem to be picking up much because the
  Japanese economy remains sluggish, he said.
      Finance Ministry officials blamed last month's slower
  import growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners worked
  off stocks they had built up in January.
      The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume of
  exports last month, after an unexpected year-on-year increase
  in January.
      This means the effects of the two-year rise of the yen
  against the U.S. Dollar are finally beginning to have an impact
  on exports, they said.
      But economists warned that may not be soon enough for
  Japan's trading partners.

  Argentine grain producers adjusted
  their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop
  downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the
  end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.
      They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates
  had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which
  has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.
      However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,
  producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain
  could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.
      Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27
  millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in
  Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in
  Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.
      There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.
      Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce
  rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the
  crops, including soybean.
      However, as the lands began drying later in the week
  harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40
  pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.
      Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested
  material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield
  estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.
      The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at
  2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast
  last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of
  4.1 mln.
      Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9
  to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.
      Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area
  sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will
  begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.
      Production estimates for maize were down from last week at
  9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated
  previously.
      This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln
  tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and
  21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln
  tonnes.
      Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to
  seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.
      Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in
  Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and
  Buenos Aires in mid-April.
      The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3
  to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.
      The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln
  tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,
  and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2
  mln tonne crop.
      The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,
  remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5
  pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for
  1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of
  7.1 mln.
      The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln
  to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln
  sown in 1985/86.
      The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some
  areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some
  experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas
  making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on
  this were not available.
      Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which

  The United States' emphasis on its
  foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's real
  problem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the General
  Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said.
       By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion
  dlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure
  which threatens the world trading system, it said in an annual
  report.
      The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federal
  budget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting government
  spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt,
  it said.
      GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct
  in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the
  previous two years.
      GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and
  instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current
  account payments deficit -- higher private savings, lower
  investment and a smaller federal budget deficit.
      Raising U.S. Trade barriers ""would result in little or no
  reduction in the current account deficit. It would, however,
  increase inflation and reduce world trade,"" it said.
      ""The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient
  domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would
  remain,"" the report said.
      GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year
  because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West
  European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a
  low dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third
  World debt management and looming protectionism.
      The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of
  Japan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986.
      The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes
  were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added.
      ""Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced
  as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not
  borne out last year,"" the report said.
      GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the
  U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly
  expanding money supply and low dollar.
      ""Such a development could worsen the business climate by
  increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in
  turn, would adversely affect world trade.""
      But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the
  United States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makes
  foreign products more expensive.
      It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human
  and in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the
  goods and services sought from abroad.
      World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986,
  about half of the rate of the previous year.
      Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct,
  continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT
  said.
      Developing countries' exports declined significantly, while
  their imports increased moderately, although full statistics
  are not available yet, GATT said.
      The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations
  were sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia,
  Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports.

  French official reserves fell 45.06
  billion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from
  421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministry
  said in a statement.
      It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign
  currency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the
  European Monetary System (EMS).
      Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francs
  during the month, the ministry said.
      This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs through
  operations of the French exchange stabilisation fund,
  counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting from
  the quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held
  with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).
      But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion franc
  deficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a
  result of using very short-term financing instruments.
      The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank and
  other central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchange
  markets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, in
  an attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flight
  of funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up the
  franc.
      On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct against
  the French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency.
      The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reserves
  to 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74

      A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor
  Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council
  said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two
  pct was achievable.
      It added the council believed ""an intensification of the
  already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial
  policy is not called for.""
      Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure on
  West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not
  increase.
      The government regularly uses the term ""changed external
  economic factors"" when referring to the fall of the dollar,
  which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials
  have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but
  could still fall below the 1986 level.
      Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany
  agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in
  February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.
      The stance taken by the experts backs up the official
  position of the West German government ahead of next week's
  seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be
  pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.
      West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not

      The experts' prediction for economic growth this year of
  between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a
  forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.

  Proven oil and gas deposits in Saudi
  Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according
  to the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco.
      Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167
  billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985,
  while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft
  from 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said.
      Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about
  200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi
  Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per
  day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.
  
      Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as
  OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture
  their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed
  from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the
  organisation decided to cut production again from last
  September onwards.
      Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.
      Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly
  to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the
  official Saudi Press Agency.
      The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the
  number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.
  
      Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44
  mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was
  upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling
  it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the

      The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned by

      Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from
  998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began
  operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes

test/16053,Economics,1,"ANALYSTS DOUBT FED FIRMED DESPITE BORROWING RISE
  Economists said that they doubt the
  Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite
  higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week
  statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.
      Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged
  393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln
  dlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were
  1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.
      ""One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it
  probably isn't,"" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.
      Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy
  modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the
  two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging
  around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.
      However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest
  two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand
  often pushes up borrrowings.
      ""Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it
  looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions
  late in the statement period and didn't quite make it,"" said
  Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
      A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that
  the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or
  more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.
      Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in
  its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer
  reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.
      The Fed took no market reserve management action last
  Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added
  temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of
  customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves
  directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.
      Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the
  two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on
  Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's
  overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.
      ""It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at
  this time,"" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.
      Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi
  said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest
  rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak
  economies in the United States and abroad and add to the
  financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.
      ""Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest
  statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar
  tumbled,"" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.
      He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new
  statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's
  Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed
  to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.
      In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in
  Wednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that
  the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade
  imbalance between the United States and Japan.
      The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for
  steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average
  Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where
  the rate has been since early November.
      ""I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter
  policy to help the dollar, as some suspect,"" said Sullivan of
  Dean Witter.
      If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just
  nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from
  six to 6.10 pct previously.

test/17620,Economics,1,"DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY
  A cut of about half a percentage point
  in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although
  economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.
      Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,
  encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide
  premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,
  might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.
      Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advances
  rate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its
  repurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.
      That rate has remained in force, just holding above the
  five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial
  bank borrowings.
      Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German
  repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,
  forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.
      In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to
  three pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered money
  market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans
  rate on lending under its three month credit quota.
      Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance
  Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.
      In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he
  would follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the Finance
  Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion
  guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct
  for an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.
      Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference
  between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under
  the credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add
  extra liquidity to the money market.
      Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to
  further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would
  result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,
  provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.
      The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its
  parity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673
  guilders per 100 marks.
      Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10
  guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level
  that would not permit a change in the interest rate
  differential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealers
  said.
      An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and
  Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, he
  said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation
  expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates
  in the longer term.
      In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,
  or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts
  point to a falling rate of economic growth.
      ""It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement
  negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,""
  the ABN economist said.
      He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in
  January, could also contribute to some inflation.
      At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to
  two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,
  currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the
  second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.
      Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying
  spree on the bond market which would bring yields down,
  probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below
  five pct.
      Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in
  the money market.

  Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback in
  planned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15
  until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle
  told Reuters.
      ""We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna,""
  he said. ""The accord reached there means stability in the oil
  market and we shall continue making our contribution.""
      The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, would
  probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Helle
  said. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and
  would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.
      OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of
  16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and
  retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord
  based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.
      OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and
  it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter
  ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth
  quarter.
      Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore
  fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from
  planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained
  within its December accord on output and prices.
      Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around
  840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln
  bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.
      The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since
  February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.
      Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for
  a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement
  on the latest oil production cutbacks.
      Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC
  producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia
  and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep
  prices stable.
      Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an
  OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around
  18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.
      Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export
  earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price
  during the first half of 1986.
      But firmer oil prices since then have brought some
  stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade
  deficit.
       Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently
  refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to
  the producing oil companies to set the levels of production.

  Australia accused the U.S. of increasing
  protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to
  Washington's special 32-year exemption from certain GATT rules
  on agricultural trade.
      Robert Arnott, Australia's delegate to the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), made the appeal at a
  special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver.
      ""Australia today said the United States' goals of reducing
  U.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by
  actions which in fact increased protection in trade in
  agriculture,"" the Australian delegation said in a statement.
      ""The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic
  flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture,"" Arnott told the
  meeting.
      Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a
  justification for ""dubious protective measures"" by the U.S. He
  listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to
  close the U.S. sugar market to imports.
      He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington to
  impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic
  support programs. This covered imports of dairy products,
  peanuts, cotton and sugar.
      Asked to comment, Michael Samuels, U.S. ambassador to the
  GATT, told Reuters: ""These charges have been made since the very
  beginning. The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agricultural
  policy, part of our law when we joined the GATT"".
      ""We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the
  Uruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with
  their programs. We can negotiate them all,"" Samuels added.
      Ninety-two nations are taking part in the four-year Uruguay

  Japan is attempting to cut back
  semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S.
  tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April
  17, industry analysts said.
      The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a
  possible shortage of the key computer components in the next
  few weeks, the analysts said.
      ""Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay of
  the Japanese semiconductor industry,"" analyst Drew Peck of
  Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said.
      But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far,
  and some questioned whether Japan would be successful in
  forcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run.
      Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence was
  already in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted
  sales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sell
  chips at below production costs.
      ""We've seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS, and
  it has virtually dried up for EPROMS,"" said Merrill Lynch
  analyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in
  computers.
      ""Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are
  stretching,"" Kurlack added.
      Industry analysts said Japan's Ministry of International
  Trade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs in
  production to meet the terms of last year's semiconductor
  accord with the U.S.
      The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on
  Japanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed to
  live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer
  components in the U.S. market.
      But some analysts said Japan's attempt to mollify the U.S.
  was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form of
  trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S.
      As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, prices
  will rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductor
  manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long
  ago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makers
  that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured.
      ""The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade
  pressures from Washington, but at the same time they're
  demonstating their muscle,"" analyst Peck said.
      The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to
  benefit U.S. chip makers.
      ""I think this could be a very important factor for U.S.
  semiconductor manufacturers,"" industry analyst Elliot Levine of
  Ladenburg Thalmann Co said.
      But analyst Peck said, ""it will take a few weeks to see
  whether Japan has genuinely cut production.""
      He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI's
  request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and
  production cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in
  plant and equipment.

  U.S. analysts expect the American
  Petroleum Institute's weekly report on oil inventories to show
  a slight build in U.S. stocks of gasoline for the week ended
  May 29, oil traders and analysts said.
      While the consensus is for an increase, a few would not
  rule out the possibility of an decline. Traders said that
  barring any surprises in tonight's report, they expect the
  report to be neutral to bearish for oil prices.
      Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to be
  steady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oil
  prices, the analysts said.
      Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming imports
  continue at relatively high levels.
      Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mln
  barrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22.
      Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, who
  looks for a build said, ""We have had five weeks of gasoline
  demand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off to
  between 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demand
  would have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw,"" he added.
      Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a draw
  in stocks of about of about one mln barrels.
     
      The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latest
  report for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasoline
  demand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year.
      But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely to
  founder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3
  pct above May 22's 81.2 pct capacity operated.
      Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and add
  to U.S. stocks.
      But some analysts said that refiners may have held refinery
  runs.
      Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between
  700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel level
  reported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks was
  discounted as having a market impact at this time.

  A takeover battle began today for
  debt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> as TransCanada
  PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO> announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer and
  Dome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers.
      Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential
  buyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A> which is 70
  pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON.N>, &lt;PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd>
  which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd
  &lt;CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>.
      Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another
  proposal from ""a substantial company"" and discussions with a
  third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a
  statement.
      The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid,
  but did not identify the companies involved in talks.
      TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline
  operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common
  and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which
  would own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer
  is to Dome management, not to shareholders.
      Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,
  totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.
  It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.
      Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement ""violated
  the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered
  into with prospective purchasers"" and was apparently timed to
  prevent Dome from considering other proposals.
      It said the TransCanada bid ""seems to require favourable and
  substantial taxation concessions from the federal and
  provincial governments."" But Dome added that its management and
  financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.
      TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he
  was surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied
  that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. ""I find (Dome's
  statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to
  authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce
  it,"" he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the
  other bidders, or the terms of other offers.
      Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the
  Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at
  5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.

  The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations
  still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize
  currencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said.
      And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the
  weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower
  range for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank of
  Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.
      ""The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and
  anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it
  later on,"" the Bank of Japan official told Reuters.
      The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the
  dollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, he
  noted.
      A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in
  monetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Would
  never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar
  against the mark or the yen.
      The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between
  140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.
      The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and
  141.35 yen.
      ""Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higher
  interest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but this
  does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework
  of the Louvre accord,"" the Finance Ministry official said.
      He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any
  further rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not only
  hurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debt
  problem.
      Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise their
  interest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond markets
  further, the monetary officials said.
      Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined
  to be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a further
  decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary
  expectations in the U.S.
      ""That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre
  agreement is still operative,"" the senior ministry official
  said.
      Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday that
  Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West
  Germany's increase in short-term interest rates.
      The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.
  Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar
  decline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,
  try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the
  accord, foreign exchange dealers said.
      But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional
  statement that ""the Louvre agreement is still operative,"" and
  this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, the
  dealers said.
      Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in
  Tokyo currency markets.
      The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised
  pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates
  higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,
  or international economic policy coordination.
      The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
  France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other's
  economic policies and from time to time apply ""peer pressure"" to
  persuade others to change their policies to a desired course,
  they noted. ""Without such a basic agreement of multilateral
  surveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West German
  policy so openly,"" the ministry official said.
      The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy
  should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy
  coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse
  of the Louvre agreement, the official said.
      He also said Japan has not received any specific request
  from the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-term
  money rates have been edging higher.
      ""This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not taking
  policy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate
  rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons,"" he
  added.

  The Bank of France is likely to cut its
  money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the
  start of next week.  This follows a steady decline in the call
  money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance
  Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said.
      The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of
  the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five
  industrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored
  considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks
  of turbulence.
      The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February
  23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily
  down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3,
  where it has now stabilised.
      Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb
  liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct.
      While call money has dropped by well over a percentage
  point, the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has
  remained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight
  pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide.
      The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at
  8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5.
      The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase
  rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while
  using the intervention rate to set the floor.
      Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said
  that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers
  said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come
  when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday,
  although an earlier cut could not be excluded.
     A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early
  as tomorrow morning, banking sources said.
      They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an
  acceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging
  the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also
  pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving
  scope for a small fall in rates.
      M-3 money supply, the government's key aggregate, finished
  1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target,
  rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985.

  force early next week, after which the buffer stock manager can
  begin buying or selling cocoa.
      Since prices are below the ""may-buy"" level of 1,655 Special

  likely to buy cocoa sooon to support the market, they said.
      Delegates and traders said they expected the manager,
  Juergen Plambeck, to intervene in the market within three weeks
  of the pact coming into force.
      The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins or
  the second hand market on an offer system, not by means of a
  posted price as in the previous cocoa accord.
      The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set of

      Purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will be

  Secretary of State George Shultz said
  the U.S. Would erase its large foreign trade deficit faster
  than many predicted, and the consequences for its trade

      ""The U.S. Economy will inevitably make the adjustment
  necessary to move from a deficit to a surplus trade balance in

  attended by the six members of the Association of Southeast
  Asian Nations and their leading Western friends.

  observers now predict.""
      ""The universal strategy of aggressive export-led growth is
  becoming less effective,"" Shultz said.
      ""It is not arithmetically possible for every country in the

  The Federal Reserve will promote lower

  First Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said.
      As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against
  inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without
  subverting national U.S. economic policy.
      ""On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and,
  because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States
  decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their
  commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its
  part by moving rates down,"" Wojnilower said in a report.

  seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants

      ""Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this time
  last year, but it's not building up a large head of steam,""
  said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.
      U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the consumer price

  pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain. Energy prices,
  which fired January's data with a three pct rise, advanced a

      The CPI came within the range of economists' expectations
  and had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets.
      Among the key components of the report, transportation
  prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gain
  reflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels and
  declines in new car prices and finance charges.
      ""There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,""

  factored into the wider economic picture.

  move aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 crop
  under way, Governor-general Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau said.
      Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop
  indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record
  501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December)
  crop year.
      The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced
  486,790 tonnes.
      For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed
  harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the
  Governor-general to demands following the May 14 coup.
      Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make
  a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for
  the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers
  for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills
  by June 23.
      Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June
  23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said.
      The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the
  full amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds
  received to-date. The balance will be paid in October.
      Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of
  23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to
  the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled
  Fiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said.
      However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of
  14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the
  forecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane
  harvested by November 30, he said.
      Ganilau said, ""This will be at least one month in advance of
  the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The
  balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the
  end of crushing.""
      Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an
  estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB)
  for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off.
  The FDB rejected this request.
      Ganilau said, however, ""The bank is prepared to carefully
  consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of
  hardship on a case-by-case basis.""
      In response to a further demand that all soldiers be
  removed from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army
  would restrict its presence in the cane areas.
      He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to
  harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions
  to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the
  commencement of harvest.

  The Kansas City Board of Trade,

  to raise the Chicago Board of Trade's, CBT, speculative
  position limits on wheat futures contracts, saying the plan
  would put the the Kansas exchange ""at a serious competitive
  disadvantage.""
      The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, last month
  proposed raising CBT wheat speculative limits to 1,200
  contracts all months net from 600 contracts, and to 900
  contracts for any single month from 600 contracts.
      At the same time, CFTC proposed leaving KCBT's wheat
  speculative position limits unchanged.
      ""Higher limits for CBT wheat than for KCBT wheat would
  significantly impair the KCBT's ability to compete with the CBT
  for speculative interest,"" Michael Braude, president of the

      A CFTC spokesman said the commission took into account open
  interest affected by existing speculative limits in proposing
  to raise CBT's limits.
      KCBT said the CFTC proposal would reduce hedging
  efficiency, constrain growth of intermarket spreading and of
  the exchange's wheat options contract and impair its ability to
  attract large speculators.
      The Kansas City exchange asked the commission to amend its
  proposal to change the limits for KCBT wheat to the exact same

training/2064,Economics,1,"BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE
  Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain's
  decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings
  banks, saying it reflected the socialist government's
  determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation
  despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity.
      The central bank last night raised the requirement by one
  percentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess
  liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets.
      Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the
  Bank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to
  choke off money supply growth.
      ""I think it's a good measure,"" a senior foreign banker said.
  ""It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates
  and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy.""
      ""It shows that the political will is very strong. They know
  that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive
  and bring down unemployment in the long run,"" he added.
      The head of another foreign bank said that only a month
  ago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise
  in reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of
  raising interest rates.
      But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now
  -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money
  from abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish
  exports less competitive.
      The government says industry's competitiveness is also
  being hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was
  way above that of Spain's major trading partners in the
  European Community, which it joined a year ago.
      To help meet this year's target of five pct, it is
  insisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for
  clashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough
  sacrifices.
      Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose
  demands essentially involve more government spending, have
  become an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe
  Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can.
      Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have
  some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the
  money market too hard.
      The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key
  overnight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at
  today's auction. The rate has been increased nine times since
  the start of the year, when it was below 12 pct.
      Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in
  any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate
  banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months.
      The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the
  publication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankers
  say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and,
  inevitably, push lending rates higher.
      A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which
  banks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect
  tomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month
  that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher
  interest rates.

  Senior Japanese officials tomorrow
  open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch
  effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide
  variety of Japanese electronic exports.
      Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of
  meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael
  Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.
      The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in
  retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to
  end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and
  to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.
      They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors,
  including television and audio equipment and computers.
      Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little
  likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct
  duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.
      President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27
  after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986
  U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that
  Japan was not honoring the agreement.
      In making the annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed to
  the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to
  provide American industry with free and fair trade.""
      Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's
  semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured
  the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has
  complained about presidential timidity on trade issues.
      Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive
  trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's
  inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last
  year reached 169.8 billion dlrs.
      About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.
      Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to
  adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.
      Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals
  but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.
      He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's
  decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense
  of MITI's power to control Japanese traders.
      ""The United States has excessive expectations.,"" he said. To
  stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by
  excess inventories since 1985 will take some time.""
      He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough
  in trying to sell in the Japanese market.

  Senate Banking Committee Chairman
  William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce
  legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of
  corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.
      Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,
  Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased
  the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.
      ""We are proposing legislation that would provide for more
  disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would
  insure that takeovers are properly financed,"" he said.
      Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold
  for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a
  investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a
  company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within
  10 days, Proxmire said.
      In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement
  that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have
  to filed with the SEC.
      Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to
  prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in
  knowing about coming takeover attempts.
      Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a
  tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60
  business days from the current 20 business days.
      His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring
  company violated the time period on the tender offer.
      To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire
  said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin
  requirments are properly enforced.
      The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement
  for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally
  enforced in hostile takeovers.
      Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover
  declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without
  actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.
      He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for
  failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin
  requirements.
      The bill also would require more disclose when several
  investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.
      ""When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know
  about it,"" Proxmire said.
      Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain
  towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all
  shareholders recieve equal treatment.
      He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover
  defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.
      Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this
  month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring.

  French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac
  opened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus on
  superpower arms control moves and trade issues.
      French officials said a major aim of Chirac's visit was to
  present France's concern that the United States might ignore
  European security interests in any accord with Moscow on
  removing medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent.
      But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will not
  agree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would give
  the Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomats
  said.
      France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missiles
  from Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge in
  other weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets,
  conventional forces and chemical weapons.
      Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French position
  saying: ""Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should
  mention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles.""
      Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a
  dispute between two leading research institutes over patent
  rights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS.
      In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the Pasteur
  Institute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, of
  Bethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties from
  the test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight
  against AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).
      ""This agreement opens a new era in Franco-American
  cooperation, allowing France and the United States to join
  their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of
  speeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure,"" Reagan
  said at the signing ceremony. 
      He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80
  per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation.
      The foundation would also raise private funds and would
  donate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in less
  developed countries. 
      Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and the
  United States during a welcoming ceremony in the White House
  East Room, with Reagan describing France as ""America's oldest
  ally in war and peace."" 
      ""I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by the
  same ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangers
  which we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, new
  diseases and drugs,"" Chirac replied.
      But the two countries are likely to have less to agree on
  over the issue of trade, where Chirac is worried about a rise
  in protectionism in the U.S. Congress. 
      A senior U.S. official yesterday dismissed a French idea to
  sell cut-price grain to poor countries in Africa as a way of
  lessening surplus stocks.
      Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea, first
  proposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume,
  during his two-day visit to Washington.
      The U.S. official described the idea as a ""grain producers'

  Countries -- and said it went against the Reagan

  requesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses
  such as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, saying
  Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.
      Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for
  beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would
  like to buy much more beef than currently allowed.
      He cited the example of a California company which
  transports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to
  circumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than
  the value of the animal, he said.
      U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion
  Corporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow
  from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986

      Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to
  eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by
  April, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually
  be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because
  liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese
  mandarin orange industry.
      The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because
  imports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And

  surplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,

  Rises in West German and international
  interest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank has
  no interest in higher capital market rates, Bundesbank
  President Karl Otto Poehl said.
      ""We consider the interest rate increase that has occurred
  here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,""
  Poehl told an investment conference.
      ""I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interest
  in higher capital market rates,"" he said.
      Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced a
  tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80
  pct.
      Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have
  seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct
  at last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in
  late September.
      The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to
  3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections
  of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct.
      These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting
  between Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
  Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt.
      Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed
  their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability.
      Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening in
  West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the
  dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended.
      But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in
  nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday.
      Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not
  due to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, and
  currency developments.
      Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said ""You
  have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a
  policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears.""
   The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he
  said.
      Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany,
  saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to
  international cooperation in interest and monetary policy.
      The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money
  supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said.
      ""Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of
  1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest
  rates have risen substantially more,"" Poehl said.
      This had to be taken into account when considering recent
  rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to
  rising international money market rates that had spilled over
  into the German market, he said.
      Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far
  ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.
      ""The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is
  definitely underway,"" he said, noting that this was not so
  noticeable in absolute figures.
      The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also
  attracted little attention, he said.

  Executive board members of the
  International Coffee Organization, ICO, passed over the issue
  of export quota negotiations at its regular meeting here,
  delegates said.
      No move was made to reopen dialogue on export quotas and no
  further discussion on the issue is likely during the three-day
  talks, they said.
      Producer and consumer members of the ICO council failed to
  agree export quota shares in early March.
      Neither Brazil, the largest producer, nor the U.S., the
  largest consumer, are ready to be flexible, delegates said.
      ""The situation is unchanged,"" consumer spokesman Abraham Van
  Overbeeke told reporters. ""As long as Brazil sticks to its
  position there will not be quotas -- there is no point in
  meeting.""
      At the last council meeting, Brazil wanted to maintain its
  previous quota share of around 30 pct of the market. Consumers
  and a splinter group of eight producers favoured redistribution
  of export shares using ""objective criteria,"" which would likely
  have reduced Brazil's share.
      Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said that, if quota
  negotiations were to resume, the 1.0 mln bag shortfall Brazil
  was willing to give up in early March if the producer proposal
  was accepted would no longer be on the table.
      ""As we said from the start...No agreement, no one million
  bags,"" he told Reuters.
      Shortfalls of 200,000 bags offered by OAMCAF, the African
  and Malagasy Coffee Organization, and 20,000 bags offered by
  Angola, are also no longer valid, delegates said.
      The closest the board came to discussing quotas was a
  briefing by the Guatemalan ICO delegate Rene Montes on a recent
  Latin American producers meeting in Managua, delegates said.
      There, the producers expressed their political will to
  negotiate basic quotas, particularly in the face of the
  damaging drop in coffee prices after the council failed to
  agree quotas, Montes said.
      The ICO board also reviewed export statistics and stock
  verification. They expected talks on stock verification to take
  up the remainder of today's session, delegates said.

  Taiwan said its foreign reserves suffered
  about 3.4 billion U.S. Dlrs in exchange rate losses from July
  1986 to February 1987 as a result of the rise of the Taiwan
  dollar against the U.S. Currency.
      Yu Chien-ming, head of the government statistics
  department, told parliament yesterday he expected the losses to
  increase as the Taiwan dollar continues to strengthen.
      The Taiwan dollar, which opened at 34.24 to the U.S. Dollar
  today, has risen about 16 pct against the U.S. Unit since
  September 1985. Some bankers expect it to rise to 33 by June
  and to 32 by the end of this year.

  Saudi Arabia's renegotiation of its
  collective agreement with Aramco to purchase oil for the
  latter's ex-partners is moving along and should lead to a
  fundamental structural change in the contract, oil industry
  sources said.
      Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, in this Monday's edition,
  said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34
  mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices and
  volumes and other terms may be rearranged.
      The agreement signed in January for the months from
  February to June is up for renegotiation.
      Under the January contract Aramco was to purchase 1.34 mln
  bpd for the four partners allocated among them as Exxon Corp
  &lt;XON> 440,000 bpd, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> 350,000 bpd, Mobil Corp
  &lt;MOB> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> 550,000 bpd between them.
      But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarter
  allowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift its
  obligations under the contract
      PIW said that that one alternative under consideration is
  to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective
  agrement.
      John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research
  Foundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of
  a formality as the Saudis have each company on a separate
  schedule although separate agreements with the companies would
  favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted
  liftings occur .
      ""The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants within
  limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long
  haul,"" he said.
      Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely
  concentrate on volume rather than price.
      Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted
  and in April industry publications said that renegotiation were
  being sought, a fact later confirmed by Reuters with Aramco.
      Aramco Corp was formerly owned by Chevron Corp &lt;CHV>, Exxon
  Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX> but is now
  owned by Saudi Arabia which bought its assets although the

  The 24 nations of the Organisation for
  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by
  sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic
  growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into
  deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.
      The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD
  economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a
  2.8 pct growth forecast in December.
      It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the
  smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest
  hit by currency appreciation this year.
      The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth
  rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in
  December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.
      It said it expected the OECD to post a current account
  deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in
  large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.
      It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to
  fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in
  1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.
      It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr
  payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.
      The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50
  dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18
  dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes
  increasingly ragged.
      It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in
  foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its
  trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last
  year's 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at
  1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate
  is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an
  average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.
      ""This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper
  angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball
  rather than a three-point landing,"" the EIU said.
      ""Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the
  February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and
  Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to
  more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter
  U.S. Fsical policy,"" it said.
      It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the
  willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government
  assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.
      ""Thus far they have been willing,"" the EIC said, adding
  that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollar
  would collapse.
      To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates
  would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt
  crisis, it said.
      On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look
  ""increasingly sick.""
      Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen
  slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to
  4.2 pct in 1988, it said.
      The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest
  single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a
  sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in
  December, the EIU said.
      On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West
  Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while
  Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.
  Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more
  competitively-priced dollar.
      It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and
  oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.

      Total investment this year, the country's second as a

      It added that Portugal's current account was forecast to
  show a surplus of 400 mln dlrs this year compared with 1.13
  billion in 1986 and 369 mln the previous year.
      Last year's high surplus was attributed to cheaper oil and

      Imports by volume were forecast to grow 10 pct this year
  and exports four pct compared with increases of 16.5 pct and
  6.6 pct respectively in 1986, the bank said.
      The forecasts were calculated on the assumption that the
  non-expansionary monetary policy carried out by the current
  government would be maintained, particularly in budget spending
  and income and in wage policy.
      The bank added that the 1987 forecasts were also based on
  the assumption that the international economic situation and
  Portugal's world trade relations would remain more or less the
  same as in 1986.
      The central bank said the high rate of investment estimated
  for 1986 was due to government policies and to increasing
  optimism among firms whose financial situation had improved
  since 1985. This tendency was expected to continue this year,
  especially in the construction and public works sectors.

      Under the plan, the four companies will set floor prices

  lower oil prices and excess domestic capacity which resulted in
  price-cutting competition, the officials said.

  Taiwan announced plans for another round
  of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade
  talks with Washington which officials described as a move to
  help balance trade with the United States.
      Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's
  Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of
  products included 60 items asked by Washington.
      ""The move is part of our government efforts to encourage
  imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United
  States,"" he said.
      He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet
  that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,
  apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut
  by between five and 50 pct.
      The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday
  and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting
  on April 20, he added.
      Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700
  foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its
  growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's
  largest trading partner.
      Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and
  pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade
  deficit with Taipei.
      Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6
  billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It
  widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78
  billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.
      Today's announcement came before a departure later today of
  a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of
  trade talks with U.S. Officials.
      The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last
  night he was leaving with ""a heavy heart,"" meaning that he would
  face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist
  sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus
  with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.
      Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.
  Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,
  purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,
  import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.
      ""I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from

  World Bank President Barber Conable
  expressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of a
  new showdown between the United States and Japan, might spread
  throughout the industrial world.
      But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the action
  by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic
  goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a
  full-scale trade war.
      Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing
  countries to open their markets, arguing that a free trading
  environment increased the possibility of global economic
  growth.
      ""We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to many
  countries in the developing world which have encouraged the
  opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the
  developed world doesn't close at the same time,"" he said.
      He said the U.S. action against Japan was ""a significant
  retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in
  trade policy.""
      The interview came just before next week's semi-annual
  meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
      Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium,
  Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious
  and must be closely watched.
      He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated on
  making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the
  developing world such as dams, roads and sewers, will
  increasingly make assistance available for economic reform.
      The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of the
  debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new
  funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms
  aimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investment
  and reducing government's role in the economy.
      ""We're comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect,
  however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio,""
  Conable said.
      He made clear, however, that adjustment lending would
  continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending
  for some time.
      He noted, ""the problem of debt was a severe one and many
  countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the
  problem of debt.""
      Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New York
  chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He
  is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched
  the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October,
  1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by
  the World Bank.
      Conable also said that he expected the result of a major
  study of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next
  several weeks.
      He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in
  part, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the
  poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the
  richest countries because of inefficiency.
      the reorganization is considered a major initiative by
  Conable, and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151
  member-countries as an indication of his management style and
  priorities.
      ""I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who
  must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be
  permitted to grow,"" Conable said.
      However, he said ""I don't believe there is anything
  basically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it
  has to have any redefinition of its purpose.""
      He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt
  initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role
  in dealing with the debt crisis.
      Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its
  sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and
  that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel
  Camdessus on a variety of issues.
      On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need
  to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that ""I don't have
  a particular mission here except to be useful to the
  institution and to the process of development.""
      He added, ""so I don't feel a great calling to personalize
  the institution.""
      On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said
  that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting
  the region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing
  of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development
  Association was earmarked for Africa.
      Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new
  forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those
  in the Sub-Sahara, during next week's meetings.

  The International Swap Dealers
  Association has developed the first standard form contract for
  use by arrangers of currency and interest rate swap
  transactions, said Thomas Jasper, the Association's
  co-chairman.
      The contract, unveiled at a press conference , is expected
  to make the 300 billion dlr a year swap market more efficient,
  he said. ""The contracts wil accelerate the process and reduce
  the expense of swap documentation,"" Japsper said.
      Privately, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of
  all new issues eventually become part of either an interest
  rate or currency swap.
      An interest rate swap occurs when two issuers, usually
  acting through a bank middleman, agree to accept each other's
  interest payments on debt securities. Usually, the issuer of a
  floating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and vice
  versa. But the obligation for repayment of the debt remains
  with the original borrower.
      Bank regulators have become concerned about the use of
  swaps because the middleman, usually a bank, takes on some
  portion of the risk but is not required to show it on the
  balance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficient
  capital to cushion it.
      Kenneth McCormick, a co-chairman of the ISDA and president
  of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said the Bank of
  England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board were expected later
  today to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capital
  standards for counterparties in swaps.
      The standards are part of the recently announced
  convergence agreement between the two countries in which
  regulators have attempted to set similar capital requirements
  for institutions.
      McCormick told reporters the ISDA was concerned that a
  ""level playing field"" be maintained in the swaps market.
      He said if U.K. And U.S. Banks were required to hold more
  primary capital against swap transactions than is the current
  practice, the additional costs would have to be passed on to
  issuers.
      The issuers might then choose to do business with
  lower-cost banks which are not subject to U.S. Or U.K. Banking
  rules.
      He said the ISDA had been working on a code of conduct for
  swap dealers as part of its self-regulatory effort.

training/2979,Economics,1,"GERMAN GOVERNMENT NEEDS SEEN RAISING BOND YIELDS
  Increased federal government borrowing
  needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy
  mark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds
  higher this year, bond market sources say.
      ""At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term
  rates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly
  on foreigners,"" one portfolio manager for a large securities
  investment house in Frankfurt said.
      The sources also said the government had already stepped up
  its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs.
      Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, the
  sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six
  pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue.
      This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct
  coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct.
      But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract
  foreign investors, and the federal government would have to
  push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon.
      Sources noted federal government issues had also increased
  in size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume
  only starting last May.
      One finance ministry economist said ""It isn't more. It's
  just the size (of each bond) which has increased."" He added
  conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly
  favourable for raising new debt.
      Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad,
  with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors.
      With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however,
  foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, as
  hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish.
      Sources said the government has may have already stepped up
  its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks.
      The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in
  1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing
  through bonds was 26.6 billion.
      The sources said this indicated a move by the government
  out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds
  through the more acceptable loan stock form.
      Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large
  amount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including
  the government's tax reduction program, would also reduce
  income next year. ""The problem here will be the tax reform,"" the
  portfolio manager said.
      He added that the government's cut in its top income tax
  rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for
  the government to reduce borrowings.
      The sources said the government would fall far short of
  covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the
  tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to
  fall back on debt markets in one form or the other.
      The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal
  government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen
  back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the
  issue of fixed-rate medium-term ""Kassenobligation"" notes.
      A finance ministry economist said the government did not
  expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a
  net 22.3 billion marks this year.
      Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would
  probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come
  into effect.
      ""I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would
  mean government borrowing will increase,"" the manager said.
      Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with
  the Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculation
  falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier.
      But sources said foreign demand for the new federal
  government loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the
  dollar may now rise against the mark.
      ""The demand wasn't so good,"" a dealer for a German bank in

      The dollar's recent slight appreciation against the mark
  even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds

  Analysts said they were surprised at
  the government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for
  fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy
  statements and positive for the economy.
      Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus
  for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs
  against a 1.95 billion deficit last year.
      Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus
  was even more positive than the most bullish analysts'
  forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.
      Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters
  before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a
  2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus.
      The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and
  the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically,
  the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite
  lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more
  confident about investing in New Zealand, he said.
      However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying
  the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will
  move lower.
      The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after
  hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget
  release.
      Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share
  market, despite an increase in the contribution of company
  taxation to revenue figures.
      One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus
  announcement could push the share market up by 50 points
  tomorrow.
      The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a
  continuation of existing policies, and the absence of
  traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively
  by overseas investors, another said.
      But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax
  avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share
  market, particularly multi-national companies.
      The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements,
  through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The
  requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln
  N.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.
      Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and
  there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another
  economist said. He added that the document seemed entirely
  credible.
      ""Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects,""
  he said.
      An election is due before the end of September.

training/10268,Markets,2,"INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP
  India is searching for non-communist
  countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
  conserve foreign exchange.
      Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and
  electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are
  all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,
  chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.
      Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in
  1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading
  Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).
      ""The two state trading corporations are free to use their
  buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
  exports,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that
  private firms are excluded from countertrading.
      One trade source said India has targetted countries that
  depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
  imports.
      However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part
  of India's total trading and are likely to account for less
  than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade
  during the nine months ended December, the sources said.
      Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65
  billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,
  against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.
      However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern
  Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.
      Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of
  agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude
  oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,
  against three billion in 1985/86.
      Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help
  narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still
  insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,
  Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.
      The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96
  billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion
  in the current fiscal year.
      But the push to include non-communist countries in
  countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow
  growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,
  shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.
      One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting
  countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made
  discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot
  officially support bartering.
      The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore
  exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.
      ""MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that
  preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind
  for goods and services sold to India,"" a trade official said,
  adding that the policy remains flexible.
      ""We also take into account other factors such as prices at
  which the goods and services are offered to India,"" the trade
  official said.
      Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign
  companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs
  and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance
  if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade
  sources said.
      Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean
  firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln
  dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.
      In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy
  Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pct
  sought by New Delhi, the trade official said.
      ""We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest,""
  he added.
      Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign
  currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to
  buy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in
  exchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars.
      But despite India's new drive, countertrade has some
  inherent problems, they added.
      ""It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that
  the trade should always be balanced,"" one trade source said. ""The
  other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy
  commodities which the other party wants.""
      Another added, ""Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it
  as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of
  payments difficulty.
      ""This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India.
  It does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy.""

  Following is the text of a statement
  by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,

  yesterday.
      1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of
  seven major industrial countries met today.
      They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of
  their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened
  economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of
  their heads of state or government.
      The managing director of the International Monetary Fund
  also participated in the meeting.
      2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to
  the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,
  and noted the progress achieved in implementing the
  undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.
      They agreed, however, that further actions will be
  essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
  global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.
      In this connection they welcomed the proposals just
  announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan
  for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's
  economy through early implementation of a large supplementary
  budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as
  unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
      The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further
  open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.
      3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that
  around current levels their currencies are within ranges
  broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic
  policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.
      In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation
  of the Louvre Agreement.
      They concluded that present and prospective progress in
  implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this
  statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to
  foster the stability of exchange rates.

  The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
  credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday
  for its last session before the Venice summit, banking
  economists and money market dealers said.
      The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month
  by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is
  unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates
  in the near future, they said.
      The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will
  be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.
      But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was
  usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and
  did not necessarily herald any policy moves.
      Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today
  there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply
  growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was
  stable against the mark.
      Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has
  opened a representative office, that the West German economy
  was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted
  1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.
      Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in
  a 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the
  Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a
  minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.
      ""They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe
  lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or
  Lombard,"" Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,
  Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.
      Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said
  German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and
  around historical lows for West Germany.
      A further cut in rates would have little impact on the
  economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,
  with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.
      The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move
  on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.
  ""The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,"" he said.
      A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in
  line with the new structure of money market rates since last
  month, would have little practical significance, dealers said.
      The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a
  diplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.
      But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it
  clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere ""eyewash.""
      Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to
  cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary
  policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.
      But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax
  cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget
  deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.
      ""The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in
  Venice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,""
  said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.
      Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before
  Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. ""But I
  don't expect any convincing measures,"" he said.
      Money market dealers noted that call money continued to
  normalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday
  and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by
  month-end distortions.
      Call money could come under upwards pressure later this
  month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on
  behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.
  Two public holidays that week could also distort the market.
      Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds
  tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55
  pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,
  and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.
      But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would
  allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not
  represent a tightening of policy, however.
      Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates
  at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full
  allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.
      On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely
  to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency
  Unit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.
      Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement
  on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the
  Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French
  occupation this century.
      But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come
  this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still
  to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be
  treated for minimum reserve purposes.

      Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an
  interview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: ""Denmark will not
  accept a ban on Danish meat exports, and I am sure we can reach

      Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns
  in 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Community
  totalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.
      Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion
  that the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC
  veterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.
      But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen said
  the inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on EC
  regulations. ""Canadian officials are very concerned about the

training/3020,Economics,1,"POEHL SAYS FURTHER RATE CUT POSSIBLE - SOURCES
  Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl
  told a closed investment symposium that West Germany could cut
  leading interest rates again if the United States makes a
  similar move, banking sources said.
      The sources were reporting Poehl's remarks at a symposium
  in Duesseldorf last week organised by Deutsche Bank Ag. Press
  representatives were not invited.
      The sources, speaking separately, said Poehl told about 200
  bankers in reply to questions that a cut in U.S. Interest rates
  would give room for a matching measure in Germany.
      ""It was a definite hint at lower German interest rates,"" said
  one banker who attended the symposium.
      A Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have no
  comment on the reported remarks, made at the private meeting.
      But, according to a second source, who also declined to be
  identified, Poehl's comments were seen by bankers present as a
  direct pointer to further moves by the central bank to defend
  German industry from an additional revaluation of the mark.
      ""He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then the
  Bundesbank would also drop them. He said that quite clearly,""
  the second source said.
      In reply to questions, Poehl also said the half-point cut
  in the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after the
  U.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting to
  discuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made such
  a move in advance, the sources said.
      Asked if American authorities could have been persuaded, by
  cuts in German rates, to come to the bargaining table as early
  as last September, one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying,
  ""No, they wouldn't have been. We checked that.""
      The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nations
  took place exactly one month after the German cut in rates.
      Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talks
  between central banks before and after the G-6 meeting, saying
  that financial markets had not fully realised the significance
  of the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem further
  falls in the value of the dollar, the sources said.
      For the first time all participants at the summit agreed
  that a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for all
  world economies, including the U.S., Poehl had said.
      The sources said the tone of Poehl's comments boosted
  growing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised around
  current levels by international central bank cooperation.
      One source said Poehl's remarks also underlined the fact
  that the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodative
  in monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown in
  West Germany's economic growth.
      Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the past
  stressed that the German central bank had no direct
  responsibility for growth and was solely concerned with
  combatting inflation.
      This led, for instance, to the introduction of a tighter
  monetary stance from the beginning of December until the
  half-point cut in rates in late January.
      The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the current
  overshooting of the German monetary target would not directly
  respark inflation. The Bundesbank was not obliged to react
  immediately whenever such overshooting occurs.
      Latest data for central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's
  main measure of money supply, showed the measure was growing at
  7-1/2 pct in January, outside its three to six pct 1987 target.
      Share prices rose in very active trading today, with
  dealers reporting that Poehl's remarks, coupled with a bullish
  outlook on stock prices from Deutsche at the same symposium,
  brought in strong bargain hunting at current low levels.

  Italy's gross domestic product (GDP) will

  said economic information company Data Resources Europe Inc

      Michel Girardin, DRI Europe's senior economist, said at a

  driven by consumption and especially investment.""
      Girardin said the driving force behind GDP growth next year

  expected depreciation of the lira against the major currencies.
      Italy's budget ministry said yesterday that GDP rose 2.7

      DRI forecast that inflation, which was an average 6.3 pct

      Girardin said the lira is expected to appreciate 14 pct

  Representatives of U.S. sugar grower
  organizations said they expect some increase the area planted
  to sugarbeets this year and said the prospects for the 1987
  cane sugar crop also are good.
      Dave Carter, president of the U.S. beet sugar association,
  said plantings may be up in two major beet growing states,
  California and Michigan, while sowings could be down slightly
  in the largest producing state of Minnesota.
      Overall, Carter predicted beet plantings would rise in the
  midwest, and this coupled with increases in California would
  increase U.S. sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1.232 mln
  acres sown last year.
      USDA later today releases its first estimate of 1987 U.S.
  sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report.
      The main reason for the expected increase in beet sowings
  is that returns from competing crops such as soybeans and
  grains are ""just awful,"" said Carter.
      In the midwest, bankers are strongly encouraging farmers to
  plant sugarbeets because the U.S. sugar program offers a loan
  rate of 18 cents per pound and because payments to farmers from
  beet processors are spread evenly over the growing season, said
  Luther Markwart, executive vice president of the American
  sugarbeet growers association.
      ""The banks are putting a lot of pressure on these guys,""
  Markwart said.
      In some areas there are waiting lists of farmers seeking a
  contract with processors to plant beets, Markwart said.
      USDA's report today will not include any harvested area
  estimates for sugarcane, but representatives of Florida, Hawaii
  and Louisiana growers said crop prospects are good.
      Horis Godfrey, a consultant representing Florida and Texas
  cane growers, said Florida cane is off to a good start  because
  for the first time in several years there was no winter freeze.
  Although area to be harvesteed is about the same as last year,
  cane production may be up in Florida this year, he said.
      In Hawaii, area harvested may decline slightly this year,
  but likely will be offset again in 1987 by increased yields,
  said Eiler Ravnholt, vice president of the Hawaiian Sugar
  Planters Association.
      The acreage planted to sugarbeets will receive more than
  the usual amount of attention this year because of mounting
  concern that continued increases in domestic sugar production
  threaten the U.S. sugar program, industry sources said.
      The increases in beet plantings have especially caused
  concern among cane growers who have not expanded plantings,
  particularly in Hawaii, industry officials said.
      ""We haven't had a good weather year throughout the beet and
  cane areas in more than five years,"" said Godfrey, adding that
  the U.S. may be due for a good weather year.
      Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., chairman of the House
  agriculture subcommittee responsible for the sugar program, has
  threatened to offer legislation next year to curb domestic
  sweetener output if growers fail to restrain output in 1987.

  Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and
  Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force
  to be reckoned with, political analysts said.
      MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.
  And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of
  a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,
  they said.
      ""The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of
  a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,""
  said one diplomatic source.
      ""They are a potent political force,"" the diplomatic source
  said.
      But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not
  always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts
  said.
      ""The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not
  so internationalized,"" said Waseda University professor Mitsuru
  Uchida. ""Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world
  community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to
  face the situation.""
      Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with
  London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep
  a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in
  Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business.
      The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival
  groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one
  competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now
  monopolizes the business.
      It has also opposed a major management role in the planned
  merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on
  the grounds that no such international precedent exists.
      The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has
  threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger
  plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open
  its telecommunications market.
      Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it
  says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car
  telephone and satellite communications market.
      Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the
  sector it regulates.
      ""What has been happening is an important shift in the
  economy which makes the ministry a very important place,"" said
  James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory
  Service Inc.
      A decision to open the telecommunications industry to
  competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted
  rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.
      ""With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto
  legal framework,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell
  Whitten.
      Close links with the powerful political faction of the
  ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime
  Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the
  analysts said.
      ""Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka
  faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance
  of MPT,"" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of
  the influential political group, he added.
      The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to
  the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the
  Postal Savings System, analysts said.
      MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate
  interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial
  liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal
  Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than
  banks, they said.
      Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's
  obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized
  the ministry as feudal.
      Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting
  competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its
  wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest
  price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.
      But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of
  its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world
  including Britain, several analysts said.
      ""The United States is really the odd man out,"" Abegglen said.
  ""For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order
  in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable
  view,"" he said.

  European currency markets reacted quietly
  to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
  ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
  surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
      The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
  and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
  reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
  stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
      Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining
  broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
      ""The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
  marks,"" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank
  AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.
      However, she said the dollar could break out of the range
  with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.
  Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.
      Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd
  in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
  the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
  possibly to 140 yen.
      A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects
  a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
      London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb
  underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
  sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
  operators to test the downside.
      Concern that finance ministers and officials still in
  Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
  currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
  worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
  long term, the traders said.
      Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
  communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
  downward trend.
      Traders in several centres said the market would look for
  fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
  defend current ranges, which the communique said were ""broadly
  consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
  intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.""
      Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said
  ""They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon."" The
  U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
      However, some dealers said London-based operators would be
  unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
  Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825
  marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
      Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said
  the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
  market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
  volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
      One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the
  communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
  further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
      The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
  1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre
  accord's supposed currency target range.
      A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
  ready for a period of ""mainly sideways movement.""
      But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
  contributing to greater stability.
      ""Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
  boost,"" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he
  expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks
  in the next three months.

test/21002,Markets,2,"HUGE OIL PLATFORMS DOT GULF LIKE BEACONS
  Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like
  beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.
      One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,
  was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.
      The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and
  concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60
  metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.
  Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.
      The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section
  of the structure remained.
      U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an
  American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.
  forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had
  been caught laying mines.
      But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense
  officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm
  missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday
  and the Sea Isle City on Friday.
      Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a
  key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.
      Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East
  now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti
  tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.
      But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level
  of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result
  of U.S. intervention and Iran's response.
      The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a
  U.S. ""tit-for-tat"" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said
  Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.
      He said with this appraoch America would suffer ""the death
  of one thousand cuts.""
      But for the United States to grab the initiative
  militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's
  harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its
  shipping must pass, Schuler said.
      He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing
  Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,
  Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.
      Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic
  initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an
  arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.
      He said the United States should also threaten to mine and
  blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to
  acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a
  settlement.
      Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by
  invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the
  outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style
  infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.
      Each side has attacked the others' shipping.

  Undersecretary of State Michael
  Armacost will visit Tokyo next week for meetings with

      He is the first high-level U.S. official to visit Japan
  since President Reagan announced last week plans to impose
  tariffs worth up to 30 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods on
  April 17 in retaliation for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up
  to a pact on microchip trade signed last September.
      Deputy State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the

      U.S.-Japanese talks of this kind are regularly held each

      The Armacost discussions with Deputy Foreign Minister

  U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen if
  the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact,
  according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy
  research groups.
      The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Institute
  of Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross
  border trade would benefit both countries.
      But Cato chairman William Niskanen added ""the two nations'
  generally harmonious trade relations are probably not
  sustainable without a new agreement.""
      The United States and Canada, whose cross-border trade
  totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding
  talks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers
  remaining between their two countries.
      The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both
  sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining
  remained.
      Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties
  could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on
  President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and
  this could hit some Canadian trade practices.
      He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto
  industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral
  free trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts.
      Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to
  a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S.
  exports to Canada.
      A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime
  Minister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and
  enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which
  would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.
      It would also increase the gross national products of both
  countries.
      Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all
  tariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules
  for trade in services and investments, end curbs on government
  procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.

  well-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand
  in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig.
      Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a

      Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln

  The European Community (EC) agreed a
  trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country
  following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC
  officials said.
      Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina
  will gain additional trading rights on a series of products
  including meat, fish and cereals by-products.
      But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with
  Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the
  officials said.
      The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC
  states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased
  quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.
      Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,
  saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals
  substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the
  officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from
  improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the
  quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500
  tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will
  be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.
      Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of
  5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced
  levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.
      The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said
  that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their
  exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They
  have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement
  on Tariffs and Trade).
      But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve
  Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had
  been affected by the country's EC membership.
      Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the
  fish dispute with Canada.
      Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC
  claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has
  improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied
  with Japanese offers of compensation.
      Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on
  citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some
  other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear
  and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.

      Dealers said they expected rates to remain within a 3.70 to

      Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23

      ""We are close, nearer than ever to accepting it, but we
  still have some work to do,"" producer spokesman Mama Mohammed of
  Ghana told Reuters after a producers' meeting.
      European Community, EC, delegates said EC consumers
  accepted the package in a morning meeting and predicted ""no
  problems"" in getting full consumer acceptance.
      Delegates on both sides are keen to come to some agreement
  today, the last day of the fortnight-long council meeting, they
  said.
      The compromise requires that buffer stock purchases from
  non-ICCO member countries cannot exceed 15 pct of total buffer
  stock purchases, delegates said. The non-member cocoa issue has
  been among the most contentious in the rules negotiations.
      The 15 pct figure, up five percentage points from earlier
  proposals, represents a concession to consumers, delegates
  said. They have demanded a larger allowance for non-member
  cocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted.
      Another problem area, delegates said, was the question of
  price differentials for different origins of cocoa bought into
  the buffer stock, by which the buffer stock manager could
  fairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered to
  him.
      The compromise narrowed the range of differentials between
  the origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a move
  some delegates described as ""just fiddling.""
      But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appease
  some countries that were not satisfied with the original
  proposed differentials assigned to them, delegates said.
      The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any
  day would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate or
  forward positions, delegates said.
      If the compromise is accepted by the council, most
  consumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect
  next week, or as soon as practically possible.
      The full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 GMT to
  discuss the compromise, and could agree on it then if all
  parties are satisfied, they said. Consumers are due to meet
  before the council.

  Pakistani government allowed freer
  cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed
  at narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.
      Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a
  televised speech the government had also decided to allow
  duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry
  more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of
  Pakistani products.
     
      Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have
  been handled exclusively by state corporations since early
  1970s.
      But Haq said now the private sector would also export
  cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a
  long-standing demand of the local traders.
      The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to
  bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries
  compete effectively in the world market, he said.
     
      Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year
  1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but
  reviewed every year.
      It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing
  trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would
  enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a
  longer period.
      He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided
  for the export of engineering goods to selected third world
  countries on soft credit terms.
     
      Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per
  cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23
  billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.
      He said the government policy was to rationalise and
  streamline import controls.
      ""It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,
  specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local
  industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs,"" he
  said. ""Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods
  produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise
  to smuggling and hampering of exports.""
     
      He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed
  from import restrictions.
      Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from
  remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the
  Gulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the
  drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a
  balance of payments crisis for Pakistan.

  Spain has revised some of its main

  economy in the first quarter, the economy ministry said in its
  monthly bulletin.
      Internal demand is now forecast to rise four pct against a
  previous target of 3.5 pct.
      Mariano Rubio, governor of the Bank of Spain, the central
  bank, yesterday said internal demand was currently growing at
  an annual rate of six pct and it had to be brought down to four
  pct if the government were to meet its five pct inflation
  target this year. Inflation was 8.3 pct in 1986.
      The forecast for private consumption growth remains
  unchanged at three pct, although public consumption is revised
  upwards to 2.5 pct from 2.0 pct.
      Growth in domestic demand will fuel imports, expected to
  increase by 8.6 pct against an originally estimated 7.1 pct.
      Export growth has been revised downwards to 3.7 pct from
  5.2 pct due to the peseta's continuing strength against the
  dollar and slack external demand.
      Slow growth of exports and a tight rein on state spending
  has lowered estimated GDP growth to three pct in 1987 from an
  earlier forecast 3.5 pct. GDP grew by three pct last year.
      The economy ministry is holding its inflation forecast to
  five pct, in spite of minister Carlos Solchaga's doubts last
  week on whether this target could be maintained if wage
  settlements continue to rise above the government's recommended
  five pct ceiling.

  The six basis point rise of the past
  month in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by a
  series of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the
  dollar holds firm.
      ""Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis
  points over the last month, largely over indications that
  inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing
  U.S. trade balance, in nominal terms,"" Samuel Kahan, chief
  financial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government
  Securities, said.
      Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in
  the economy during the first quarter, but his concern is
  whether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the
  longer term.
      Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has
  become more important to the direction of debt futures than the
  beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.
      The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. Consumer
  Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down
  1.5 pct, respectively.
      Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money
  supply announced this week was ""surprising, much larger than
  expected,"" according to Kahan. ""Unless quickly reversed,"" such
  a trend ""will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,""
  Kahan said.
      Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which
  Kahan said have ""slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board
  annual targets,"" the consequences could be a hint of economic
  weakness down the road, he said.
      Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for
  further gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,
  analysts said.
      September T-bonds ""are up almost six points since about May
  18,"" Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September
  bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93
  in mid-June, Duggan said.
      While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,
  and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through
  chart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted
  above the 93 level.
      ""The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken
  out before this activity is anything other than a trading range
  market,"" Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst
  Brian Singer said.
      The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.
  currency has made little headway of late, analysts said.
      ""The critical variable remaining in the market is the value
  of the dollar,"" Kahan said.
      Additional influences next week will be possible
  developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact
  and size of the U.S. budget deficit, ""although these will not
  be in the forefront of the market early next week,"" Kahan said.
      In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding
  auctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and
  Thursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results
  with little excitement. However, a successful auction could
  prove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market
  psychology.

  practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates
  around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there
  are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
  middlemen, exporters and processors.
      There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit
  for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in
  obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.
      In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have
  sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.

  March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times
  New York Dec for Oct/Dec.
      Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible

  National Bank economic data for 1986
  shows that Yugoslavia's trade deficit grew, the inflation rate
  rose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded and
  the value of the dinar fell.
      The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pct
  higher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first three
  months of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hard
  currency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs.
      Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures in
  dinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollars
  based on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar.
      Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with the
  convertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344
  mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to a
  deterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currency
  area rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.
      Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 while
  industrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank's data
  showed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct.
      Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986.
      Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wages
  were too high given the level of productivity.
      Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of the
  last quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity.
      Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 money
  supply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9
  billion dinars. Yugoslavs have 9.8 billion dlrs worth of
  foreign currency savings in the country and 20 billion dlrs
  abroad, mostly owned by workers employed in western Europe.
      The dinar fell by 73.1 pct against a basket of hard
  currencies in 1986. The highest depreciation was against the
  Swiss franc, 85.3 pct, and the lowest against the U.S. Dollar,
  46.2 pct.

  U.S. bank discount window borrowings
  less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to
  Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said.
      The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131
  mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs
  at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week
  statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451
  mln dlrs.
      Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February
  25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of
  644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.
      A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that
  there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve
  projections in the week to Wednesday.
      He said that natural float had been ""acting a bit
  strangely"" for this time of year, noting that there had been
  poor weather during the latest week.
      The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500
  mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to
  nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday.
      The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high
  float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's
  float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at
  two widely separated Fed districts.
      For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of
  adjustments were ""small,"" adding that they fell to a negative
  750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for
  unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the
  country.
      The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two
  different clearing banks had system problems and the securities
  and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or
  2100 EST on both days.
      However, he said that both problems were cleared up during
  both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve
  impact.
      During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount
  window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct
  by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional
  institutions.
      On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by
  the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and
  15 pct by the smallest banks.
      The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess
  reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on
  Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average
  deficit for the week as a whole.
      For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high
  excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at
  the smallest banks.

  Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2
  pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in
  August, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here.
      Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at
  several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at
  fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field
  rescue project.
      Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's
  voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil
  output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise
  oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.
      Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the
  production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all
  its North Sea fields for the rest of the year.
      Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway
  would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.
      The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which
  pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August,
  field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.
      Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use
  the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while
  Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.
      BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula
  field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping
  to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.
      Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd
  last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company
  said.
      September production was also sharply higher at the
  Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which
  extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd
  against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats
  Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.
      Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like
  Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd
  in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous
  month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.
      Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd
  in September, compared with 100,188 in August.
      Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test
  output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl
  totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in
  August.
      Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on
  stream a second well, cutting September production to just two
  days.

  Strong growth in domestic demand was a key
  feature of the economies of southern European countries in
  1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the
  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.
      In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's total
  domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to
  five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth
  restrained private consumption.
      Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and
  domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected
  to be halved to five pct next year.
      In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment,
  had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross
  Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption
  were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain
  strong.
      The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply
  next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European
  Community and declining competitiveness.
      In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards
  following an increase early this year linked with the
  introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due
  to cold weather.

      The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude

  The United States should take urgent
  action to cut its crippling budget deficit, including possible
  reductions in non-defense spending, higher taxes and curbs on
  growth of the defense budget, the Organization for Economic
  Cooperation and Development said.
      The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy,
  said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress
  quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit ""could seriously
  affect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere.""
      It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987,
  running until September 30 this year, would substantially
  overshoot both the Balanced Budget Act's target of 144 billion
  dlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion.
      ""The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions of
  slower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for the
  first half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190
  billion dollars,"" it said.
      While this would be 30 billion lower than last year's
  deficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax
  increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect.
      The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to
  2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last.
      In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exports
  boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth.
      Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service
  sector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to be
  heading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumer
  prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct next
  year after just 2.1 pct in 1986.
      ""Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors
  behind the avoidance of recession,"" the report said.
      The current account balance of payments deficit is expected
  to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, after
  hitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.
      In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly

      In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion
  dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one
  pct to 12.43 billion dlrs.
      In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has
  decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine.
      Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen
  Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application
  of French quality standards -- something EC states say often
  happens to their own exports entering Japan.
      Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese
  banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,
  because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in
  competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract.
      However, British officials in London have said that the
  government may have gone too far in implying that it would take
  immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.
      By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful
  economy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring
  to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own
  industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan.
      The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent
  years, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open
  its market with specific demands for moves in key areas.
      At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end
  allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and
  spirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts
  for the building of a new international airport, and to
  simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.
      EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but
  often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff
  barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.
      They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the
  EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.
      One of the problems Britain could face if it were to
  withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers
  would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,
  they point out.

  Columbia Gas Transmission
  corp said it made an abbreviated, streamlined filing with the
  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover a portion if
  its costs of renegotiating high-cost gas purchase contracts.
      Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiary
  said, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice a
  proposal to include these costs in the company's most recent
  purchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing.
      Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denial
  ruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternative
  filing if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing to
  include the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA or
  consolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filing
  and permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one.
      The company said the alternative filing seeks to recover
  about 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas sales
  commodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based on
  recovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period,
  beginning April 1, 1987.
      Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipeline
  commodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln.
      The company said it orginially sought to include these
  costs in its PGA since the payments to products resulted in
  almost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and were
  not related to take-or-pay buyout costs.
      It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April
  10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-pay
  buyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filing
  under the Natural Gas Act.
      As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas,
  Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average price
  paid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrs
  per mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April

  French Agricultural Minister
  Francois Guillaume warned that France would flatly reject
  proposed reforms of the European Community, EC, cereals, sugar
  and oilseeds sectors, which he said would disrupt these
  markets.
      The EC Commission's proposals to shorten the intervention
  period and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase the
  financial burden on the sugar producers will also result in
  lower real prices for producers, he told farmers here.
      ""I give you my word that France, while it will not reject
  technical adjustments or serious discussion, will simply reply
  in the negative to these bad reforms,"" Guillaume told the annual
  conference of the country's major farm union, FNSEA 
  (Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles).
      Community agricultural ministers are due to meet again
  Monday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spiralling
  EC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88.
      Relations between the government and farmers have become
  strained in France in recent months.
      There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations by
  farmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices and
  further cutbacks in Community milk output.
      But Guillaume's warning that he would reject reorganisation
  of the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a major
  producer of both crops -- won him warm applause from the
  FNSEA's farmers.
      His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for the
  complete dismantling of the system of cross border taxes
  designed to smooth out currency differences known as Monetary
  Compensatory Amounts, MCA's, however, are unlikely to avoid
  further protests by producers.
      Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to go
  ahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroad
  against the EC Commission's proposals to overhaul the farm
  sector.
      ""The Minister's proposals back up our determination to
  organise union action in the coming weeks,"" he told reporters,
  adding that this could also act in Guillaume's favour on a
  ministerial level.
      Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before being
  appointed farm minister last spring.
      Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt that
  Guillaume was doing a good job as farm minister.
      There have been certain advances on cutting production
  costs, reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid, but
  there are still areas where more could be done such as on
  farmers' indebtedness, he said.
      Guillaume told the conference the government will make
  available 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producers
  reduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire.
      The government has already announced financial aid for the
  milk sector and it was not clear how much of the package
  announced today was new aid, Lacombe said.

training/2554,Economics,1,"U.S. MONEY GROWTH SLOWS SHARPLY, ECONOMISTS SAY
  U.S. money supply growth is slowing
  down rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of the
  Federal Reserve's main monetary aggregates may even have
  contracted in February.
      A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the
  Fed, especially as it would follow a long period of torrid
  growth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the
  weeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy
  was justified on account of weakness in the economy.    
      M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reported
  today, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminary
  forecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs.
  The monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs.
      M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3.
  With other components of M-2, such as money-market deposit
  accounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage is
  set for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say.
      M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditional
  link to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of
  falling interest rates and banking deregulation.
      But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is
  likely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch
  Economics Inc.
      ""The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they're all
  sending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrows
  at the Fed,"" McCarthy said.
      Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, ""We
  have some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It's
  coming in a lot weaker than I thought.""    
      The economists were quick to caution that one month's data
  prove nothing, especially because money growth previously had
  been so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct
  rate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.
      Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be
  explained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the
  booming stock market and is thus not an indication of a
  slowdown in the business expansion.
      But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond
  markets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a
  reflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.
      McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with
  signs that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter
  progresses. ""Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as
  they were a month ago,"" he noted.
      He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and
  rises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.
      Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct
  or less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate
  enough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national
  product for the first quarter proved to be weak. ""You'd
  certainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past.""
      There was certainly nothing in the Fed's latest balance
  sheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under
  way, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in line
  with expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day.
      Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc
  argued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to
  solve America's most urgent economic problem, its massive trade
  deficit. Because of the possibility that further dollar
  depreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed to
  close the trade gap, Brusca said ""I'm not prepared to be all
  that optimistic about the bond market.""

      Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday

  A senior British official said that
  protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger
  retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the
  global trading system.
      Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if
  Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which
  would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian
  textile producers, ""the community would have to retaliate.""
      His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade
  Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the
  community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.
      Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two
  days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members
  of Congress.
      De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.
      Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in
  Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the
  Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade
  deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.
      Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to
  force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.
      Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone
  problems - its surplus with the United States last year was
  51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.
      ""The more united pressure there could be, the better,"" he
  said.
      Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to
  avoid trade disputes.
      He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation
  earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and
  Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports
  regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.
      ""But if both sides drew back from the brink that time,"" he
  said, """"it does not mean that they would do so on another
  occasion.""
      Channon added that ""There is increasing reesentment in
  Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure
  of unilaterally imposed deadlines.""
      He said other potential conflicts are already in sight -
  alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and
  taxes on fats and oils - and ""the commuity and the United States
  must therefore learn to manage their relations better.""
      He said another bill to let the United States retaliate
  against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S.
  goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on
  Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.

  reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted
  confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered
  the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.
      This need for additional reassurance was made all the more
  acute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from
  the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase
  agreements for the first time since April of last year,
  economists added.
      Today's data showed that the draining action was for a
  fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said.
      ""The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively
  sizeable matched sales on Wednesday,"" said Dana Johnson of
  First National Bank of Chicago. ""But there was a clearly
  justified need for them. There was nothing ominous.""
      ""The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new
  statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its
  (reserve) projections,"" added Security Pacific's Bannon.
      A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large
  single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week.
      Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than-
  expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount
  window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week,
  compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln.
      For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the
  daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from
  160 in the prior period.
      ""There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and
  Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings,"" said
  Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday
  average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.
      Lending further support to the stable policy view was a
  relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the
  latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in
  the banking system, economists said.
      ""For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path,
  with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct,"" said Darwin Beck of
  First Boston Corp. ""I expect it to continue in that vein.""
      ""Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion
  dlrs,"" added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reserves
  averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement
  period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one.
      After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range
  to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little
  attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion
  dlr jump in the week ended February 16.
      Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a
  fine line between the dollar's progress in the international
  currency markets and the development of the domestic economy.
      ""The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on
  Fed policy,"" said First Chicago's Johnson. ""Of course, it will
  take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if
  the economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing.""

training/10306,Markets,2,"PHILIPPINE SUGAR CROP SET AT 1.6 MLN TONNES
  Philippine sugar production in the
  1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes,
  up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, Sugar
  Regulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said.
      Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current milling
  season, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimate
  would almost certainly be met.
      He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop would
  be earmarked for domestic consumption.
      Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for the
  U.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and
  50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market.
      He said if the government approved a long-standing SRA
  recommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would take
  up another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target.
      ""The government, for its own reasons, has been delaying
  approval of the project, but we expect it to come through by
  July,"" Yulo said.
      Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oil
  import bill by about 300 mln pesos.
      Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to
  start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved.
      The ethanol project would result in employment for about
  100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work by
  depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry.
      Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, had
  been submitted to President Corazon Aquino.
      ""I think the President would rather wait till the new
  Congress convenes after the May elections,"" he said. ""But there
  is really no need for such quotas. We are right now producing
  just slightly over our own consumption level.""
      ""The producers have never enjoyed such high prices,"" Yulo
  said, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos
  per picul, up from 190 pesos last August.
      Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation
  following the SRA's bid to control production.
      ""We are no longer concerned so much with the world market,""
  he said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned from
  their mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and
  cloth production.
      He said diversification into products other than ethanol
  was also possible within the sugar industry.
      ""The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons,"" Yulo said.
  ""They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but they
  relocated many of them and diversified production. We want to
  call this a 'sugarcane industry' instead of the sugar industry.""
      He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, used
  for thatching roofs, or used in room panelling.
      ""When you cut sugarcane you don't even have to produce
  sugar,"" he said.
      Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the
  International Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984.
      ""As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new
  agreement which would revive world prices,"" Yulo said.
      ""If there is no agreement world prices will always be
  depressed, particularly because the European Community is
  subsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets.""
      He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60
  cents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, where
  production costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound.
      ""If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents I
  expect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end
  of this year,"" he said.
      Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by
  1990, with world consumption outstripping production.
      He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments
  from artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup.
      ""But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration,"" he
  said. ""Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the
  U.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cut
  ours in half without any justification.""
      Manila was keenly watching Washington's moves to cut
  domestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents.
      The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its
  12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to
  143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986.
      Yulo said despite next year's increased production target,
  some Philippine mills were expected to shut down.
      ""At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the
  1986/87 season,"" he said. ""We expect two or three more to follow
  suit during the next season.""

  U.S. refiners will have to
  reduce operations if they want to be profitable this year, said
  industry officials attending the National Petroleum Refiners
  Association meeting here.
       ""If the refining sector can discipline itself to refine
  about 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day, we have a chance to
  pull down inventories to acceptable levels by the second
  quarter, said Archie Dunham, executive vice president of
  petroluem products at Conoco Inc
      ""If not, the industry will have a tough 1987,"" he added.
       Last week's American Petroleum Institute report said that
  U.S. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity,
  with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the week
  ended March 20.
       The API said that with the higher crude oil runs, 
  distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-ago
  levels. Gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels, some 17.2
  mln barrels above year-ago levels. Distillate stocks, at 108.7
  mln barrels, are 10.9 mln barrels above last year's level, the
  API said.
       Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp
  &lt;CNP> told Reuters that unless refining and marketing return to
  profitability, oil companies will have to rely on downstream
  operations to produce an acceptable level of earnings.
       ""The jump in refining capacity is a concern if it
  continues,"" said Kenneth Buckler, executive vice president of

       Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity given

  Buckler said.

  Eurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will no
  longer be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, the
  spokesman said.
      Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles 
  may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early. Most have
  maturities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984, the
  spokesman said.
      He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have an
  adverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the general
  decline in interest rates means they will be able to refinance
  at lower interest rates.
      However, the holders of the bonds presumably will be faced
  with lower yields.

test/17452,Economics,1,"U.S. STUDY SAYS TARIFFS AND QUOTAS COULD BACKFIRE
  The use of tariffs and quotas to
  reduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will do
  little to cut the nation's swelling trade deficit, a government
  study said.
      In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said,
  such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products less
  competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of
  imported products that are re-exported in different forms.
      ""Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than
  help, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy,"" it said.
      The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilke
  and Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, which
  climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shifting
  currency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand.
      Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as
  foreign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrial
  competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions
  on mergers, added little to the problem, it said.
      ""Although each industry's competitiveness affects the level
  of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find
  that there have been no significant industry-specific changes
  affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in
  the overall trade deficit,"" the study said.
      ""To the extent any government action is needed to deal with
  the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide
  phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,""
  the FTC study said.
      Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts
  were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report
  said it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost some
  domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.
      It also said it found a ""fairly direct relationship"" between
  the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting
  currency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domestic
  demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign
  consumer demand.
      The study examined seven factors which have been commonly
  blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and
  trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of
  investment in U.S. Industry, declining research and development
  in U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil
  prices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.
      In each case, the study found little or no evidence that
  the factor had any impact on the trade deficit.

training/2521,Economics,1,"BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS
  Brazil's recent announcement of a
  suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign
  debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views
  among many international economists and commodities analysts
  that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987.
      The developing world's most indebted nation is also its
  most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as
  coffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchange
  revenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said.
      ""That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is no
  way they can trade their way out of this situation,"" Aldo
  Roldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase
  Econometrics, said.
      Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the
  problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted
  world markets, but also had to work to make its position on
  foreign exchange markets more profitable.
      ""Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and
  exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange
  rates,"" Roldan said.
      The Chase economist also said commodities markets were
  depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a
  country like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50
  pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23
  billion dlrs.
      But he added: ""They are always pretty aggressive and they
  have good foreign marketing channels.""
      Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be
  coffee, and even without background pressure from foreign
  creditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the
  market this year with a vengeance.
      Negotiations between International Coffee Organization
  (ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up
  earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing
  each other of intransigence.
      ""Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,
  which others wanted changed,"" one senior coffee dealer said.
      The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to
  preserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said
  Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others
  would suffer.
      Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but
  as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the
  dealer said.
      ""If they do come into the market at this level it will go
  lower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,""
  he said.
      New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents
  lower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant
  deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.
      President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster
  told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has
  no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of
  the ICO talks on export quotas.
      Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the
  focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. ""They
  will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,""
  according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache
  Securities Inc.
      Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus
  difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the
  Brazil soybean crop. ""Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and
  they can't afford to store the crops,"" he said.
      The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time
  about large South American crops developing under near ideal
  conditions towards record yields.
      ""We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than
  usual, this year in our (U.S.) exports,"" Loewy said.
      Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean
  Association (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest
  could total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.
      Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices
  are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the
  vulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.
      Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a
  reduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to
  farmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.
      He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the
  soybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices
  by keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can
  forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the
  loan.
      ""We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are
  starting to harvest and starting to export,"" Eshleman said. But
  he added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below
  10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.
      Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel
  Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much
  as it can this year because of its economic situation.
      He said the debt situation was a major consideration. ""The
  Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for
  storage,"" he added.
      Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil
  would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said
  it would not make a big difference.
      On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may be
  muted no matter its need to generate capital.
      Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which
  could limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The
  country may have oversold and be unable to honor export
  commitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by
  consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will
  give it little room to stretch exports, they said.
      Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of
  surplus. ""Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it
  fell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and
  find many more markets for it,"" one analyst said.
      ""If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would
  collapse and they can't afford to do that,"" she added.

  Dwindling global crude oil reserves and
  the lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send
  the world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former Atlantic
  Richfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said.
      ""It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks,"" Anderson
  told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. ""I
  believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in
  two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find.""
      Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil
  and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln
  barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about
  4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.
      ""If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up
  one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle
  East,"" he said. ""We're soon going to be right back where we
  were in 1973 and 1979.""
      Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at
  about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.
      ""There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't
  enough supply,"" he said. ""There have been no major oil
  discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years.""
      Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major world
  discovery, has already produced about five billion barrels of
  oil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said.

  Texaco Inc has re-established some key
  oil supply lines following yesterday's court filing for
  protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, said
  Elton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations.
      ""Several companies say they are willing to start trading,""
  Yates told Reuters in an interview.
      The company last week had stated that a number of domestic
  and international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil
  shipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.
  Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings.
      Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and other banks told
  Texaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texaco
  said in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> and J.P.
  Morgan Co's &lt;JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits
  to cover transactions, it said.
      The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose
  from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme
  Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> over
  the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.
      The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's
  plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.
      ""Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they
  could,"" Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court
  ruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting
  supplies.
      ""It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an
  avalanche,"" he said. ""Supplies were cut to the point where we
  could not run the system at anywhere near capacity.""
      He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in
  jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages
  by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton
  said.
      It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,
  canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,
  Occidental Petroleum Co &lt;OXY> demanded cash for crude, and
  Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> asked for special safeguards.
      The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC &lt;BP> last
  week refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today
  said, ""a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on
  supplying. They had cancelled last week.""
      He declined to identify the company.
      &lt;Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oil
  company that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also
  halted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said.
      But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the
  Venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key
  supply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the
  Algerians, he added.
      Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter
  11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines
  and oil supplies that are key to the company's business.
      ""It will be business as usual for Texaco,"" said Martin
  Klein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer
  and Traub.
      ""Creditors are a nervous bunch of people,"" he said. ""But
  when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and
  will likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company.""

  banks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished.

  Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.
  dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will
  propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record
  profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,
  major company executives predicted.
      This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an
  industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF
  Corp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms
  to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.
      Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the
  Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for
  money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.
      ""I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,"" said
  Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,
  ""There's no major plant capacity being added around the world
  now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving
  the old ones.""
      Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,
  automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of
  paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.
      U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about
  90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike
  product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,
  managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand
  for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up
  by as much as 300 pct, he said.
      Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in
  Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned
  last year and predicted it would have the best year in its
  history.
      In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel
  and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.
  dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. ""I believe the entire
  chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,""
  Oreffice said.
      GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical
  industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.
  Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion
  dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.
      The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical
  industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and
  planning, said Pace's John Dosher.
      Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks
  dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar
  was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost
  U.S. chemical exports.
      Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has
  been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical
  manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers
  in the early 1980s.
      Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers
  have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program
  to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate
  unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of
  friendly and hostile takeover attempts.
      GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire
  Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs
  for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics
  and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> 
  has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer
  businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.
      But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be
  headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on
  the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as
  ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that
  are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.
      ""Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the
  past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity
  chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had
  deteriorated,"" Dosher said. ""But I think they will eventually
  kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche
  market."" Some top chemical executives share the concern.
      ""The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting
  carried away and repeating past mistakes,"" GAF's Heyman
  cautioned. ""The shift from commodity chemicals may be
  ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.""
      Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the
  Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700
  mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.
      Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout
  of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1
  billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants
  along the Texas Gulf Coast.
      The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that
  are the building blocks of specialty products.
      ""This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a
  glamorous, high-margin business,"" Cain said, adding that demand
  is expected to grow by about three pct annually.
      Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said
  chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for
  plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood
  and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical
  business could last as long as four or five years, provided the
  U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.

      ""We don't want to go down that road,"" Reagan was quoted as
  telling Prime Minister Jacques Chirac after the visiting French
  official expressed concern about the rising tide of
  protectionist sentiment in the United States.
      Later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the

  ""do not believe this will result in a trade war.""
      ""It is the first time that the United States has taken an

  The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is
  likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and
  possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian
  Nainggolan said.
      He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in
  palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.
      Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil
  may also be introduced. But he said the question was still
  being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no
  decision on when to go ahead had been made.
      The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber
  physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.
      ""Several factors make us move cautiously,"" Nainggolan said.
  ""We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a
  mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.""
      Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee
  added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to
  five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are
  traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,
  exchange officials said.
      The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the
  introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one
  official said a feasibility study was needed first. No
  decisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April
  23, traders said.
      Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the
  world's second largest producer of natural rubber, should
  expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of
  the exchange would help this.
      Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost
  overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.
      He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to
  encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would
  also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to
  encourage participation.
      Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start
  although trading in coffee has been disappointing.
      Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in
  April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9
  mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered
  locally, the latest exchange report said.
       Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905

  The Soviet Union's industrial output is
  growing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign trade
  has fallen, Central Statistical Office figures show.
      Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda show
  industrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of
  1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period.
      Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986
  period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2
  pct.
      Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billion
  roubles. Separate import and export figures were not given.
      One factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction
  of a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Last
  year's calculations of industrial output included all goods,
  irrespective of quality.
      Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leader
  Mikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, special
  inspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below
  standard.
      Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were
  rejected in the nine-month period.
      The figures also showed that on October 1, there were more
  than 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000
  people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector,
  Pravda said, without giving comparative figures.
      The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the
  economy has been an important part of the modernisation
  campaign, with measures introduced recently to allow the
  setting up of small shops on a private basis.
      Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine months
  against 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986.
      But western economists said they treat Soviet productivity
  figures with caution, as they are more broadly based than in
  the West, which measures worker output over a given period.
      Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Union
  as of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5
  mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same period

  Switzerland's economy, combining low
  unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments
  surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory
  future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
  Development, OECD, said.
      This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight
  fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it
  said.
      The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out
  some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in
  inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.
      The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product
  growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986
  and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after
  last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.
      But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest
  increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate
  unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial
  nation OECD area.
      Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to
  the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986,
  the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct
  rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct
  respectively in 1986.
      The faster growth of imports compared with exports this
  year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant
  that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP
  would shrink in both years.
      But ""given Switzerland's large external surplus, there
  should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than
  GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to
  improving international balances,"" the OECD said.
      Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually
  buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several
  years of relative weakness, it noted.
      In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat
  to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall
  GDP, it added.
      The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained
  bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels
  last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation
  in both the industry and service sectors, it said.
      As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment
  investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year
  after vigorous growth in 1986.
      But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for
  tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector
  earners of foreign exchange.
      The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the
  accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could
  lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.
      Particularly for the banks, ""recent developments in
  international financial markets give rise to the question
  whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial
  flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed
  required ... To preserve its competitive position,"" it said.

  department said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largest
  buyers.
      Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September
  1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.
      Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season and
  net reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were
  four-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and the

      Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination with
  purchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said.
      Other significant purchasers for the current year were
  Mexico and Honduras, it said.
      Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below the
  prior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.
      Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the major
  purchasers, the department said.
      Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell
  31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-week
  average. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, the
  Netherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset by
  reductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.
      Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400
  tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700
  tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, the
  Department said.
      Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200
  bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88

  but nine pct below the four-week average.

  A sugar mill which was this
  nation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday,
  saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from
  Miami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic.
      The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO)
  will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to
  40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital,
  the company said.
      ""Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO
  regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane
  after April 10,"" the mill warned planters earlier this week.
      Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen
  months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking
  oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer
  prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing
  hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work.
      At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to
  receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a
  warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound
  (45-kg) bags of sugar.
      ""We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar.
  We have no money left to continue operations,"" Rigaud said.
      He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an
  additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.
      Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier
  two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar.
      He said the government then began importing refined sugar
  at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and
  the provisional military-civilian government that replaced
  Duvalier last year continued the policy.
      ""But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete
  with smuggled Dominican refined sugar,"" Rigaud said.
      HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above
  the usual minimum wage of three dlrs.
      It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian
  supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at a
  minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people.
      Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. ""We're dead,
  and it's the government that's causing us to die,"" declared
  Lucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents.

      In a statement reacting to the five institutes' joint

  British Sugar Plc was forced to shut its
  Ipswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acute
  shortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to a
  Reuter inquiry
      Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combination
  of very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in the
  factory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week's
  hurricane which blocked roads.
      The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are
  cleared and supplies of beet build up again.
      This is the first time in many years that a factory has
  been closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.
      Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,
  but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.
      Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British
  Sugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year
  out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.
      Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting
  problems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining
  its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2
  mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the
  spokesman said.
      British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.
      The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,
  is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories
  normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the
  campaign.
      As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been
  harvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13

training/2709,Economics,1,"IMF URGES BELGIUM TO MAKE FURTHER SPENDING CUTS
  The Belgian government, which
  introduced large-scale public spending reductions last year,
  has been told by an International Monetary Fund team there is
  scope for further cuts in 1988.
      The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions
  of the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economic
  policy, a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the
  weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet.
      The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interest
  rate policy, with a particular emphasis on long-term rates.
      The team's report to the government praises last year's
  spending cuts, which are due to reduce 1987 government spending
  by 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy
  perform ""better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far in
  the 1980s.""
      However, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisation
  of the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much
  lower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the
  government has set itself for 1989.
      The government's net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of
  GNP in 1986.
      The report says ""The most that can be afforded over the next
  few years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of
  general Government.""
      It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian tax
  system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax
  burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the
  debt to GNP ratio before this is possible.
      ""Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure
  growth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions,
  we feel that your position would be stronger if you could
  decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988,"" the
  report adds.
      The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the
  government's determination to keep its currency strong and to
  curb inflation.
      It says firmer long-term rates would slow private net
  long-term capital outflows, which increased strongly in 1986.
      It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and
  an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the
  subscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues in
  Belgian francs.

  The Bank of Spain said it raised the

  money supply and inflation targets.
      In a statement issued late last night, the central bank
  said the measure would take effect from March 13.
      ""In recent weeks, there has been excess liquidity in the
  Spanish economy which, if not controlled, would threaten the
  monetary and inflation targets set by the government,"" the
  statement said.
      Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200
  billion pesetas from the system. The maximum reserve
  requirement allowed by law is 20 pct.
      The move follows a half-point increase yesterday in the
  Bank of Spain's key overnight call money rate, which now stands
  at 13.5 pct. At today's auction, however, the bank left the
  rate unchanged.

      Banking sources said that although the January money supply
  figures were good, compared with annualised rates of 13.9 pct
  in December and 10.2 pct in January 1986, ALP growth appeared
  to have accelerated in February, raising government concern.
      Regarding inflation, recent figures have suggested that
  prices were under control.

  Ordonez, said this week that the annualised inflation rate for
  February, not yet officially announced, fell to 5.5 pct from

      Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrs
  from 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period. Earnings per share

training/11498,Economics,1,"TRADE WAR FEARS MAY PROMPT STOCK MARKETS' DOWNTURN
  The threatened trade war between the
  United States and Japan is just the kind of shock that
  economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin.
      But they are not so sure if that would be a brief
  corrective dip, or whether this week's falling share prices
  mark the start of a ""bear"" market.
      ""It's the billion dollar question,"" said Richard O'Brien,
  economist at American Express International Bank in London.
      Japan's trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- has
  poured into share and bond markets around the world, and funded
  a good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third of
  any new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the
  Japanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as the
  dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it
  fall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart of
  improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or
  because the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods,
  may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget
  deficit.
     And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will
  have less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the
  gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S.
  Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O'Brien said. The
  subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls
  on the world stock markets.
      ""A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,""
  said O'Brien. ""Now, it is much less certain.""
      Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming
  economy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best in
  the industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt and
  huge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O'Brien.
      Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of Smith
  Barney Harris Upham said  ""We're still in a bull market,"" adding
  that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and ""The
  bear usually strikes slowly.""
      Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co in
  London, said the huge sums of money going through the world
  financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices.
      Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in
  non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it's very
  difficult to see where else they can put their money than in
  U.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market,
  according to David Butcher, a senior executive at Yamaichi
  Securities Co Ltd's bond operation in London.
      He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention now
  to the French franc and West German mark.
      In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions and
  the dollar's slide will mean for securities markets.

      They said this had come as a surprise and expected the

  UAL Inc may have a response this
  afternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its United
  Airlines unit, a UAL spokesman said.
      ""Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and we
  need to get a clarification out,"" the spokesman said, adding
  that there was a ""50-50"" chance a statement would be released
  today.
      The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for
  2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.
      Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for several
  weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer
  Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also
  held discussions with its chairman.
      The developer indicated in those talks that he took the
  position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.
      Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying
  UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2
  mln shares.
      ""United has got to consider this proposal. I think the
  pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,
  but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL
  management,"" said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.
      Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack
  when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz
  rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a
  strategy to become a travel service company.
      The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union
  concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention
  on its airline.
      UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its
  new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.
      But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has
  been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100
  dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as
  widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe
  the stock is in play.
      Market sources have said that although Trump attracted
  attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a
  catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps
  throwing the company into the hands of another buyer.
      ""The first domino is you have an investor with a
  considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type
  of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,""
  said Pettee.
      ""What's interesting is the values are there. There's
  something for everybody,"" he said.

test/21006,Markets,2,"DIPLOMATS CALL U.S. ATTACK ON OIL RIG RESTRAINED
  A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform
  in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid
  carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab
  allies, Western diplomats in the region said.
      U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that
  U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf
  in response to a missile strike on the American-registered
  Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
      ""We consider the matter closed,"" he said, a signal the U.S.
  administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.
      Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day
  against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action
  would endanger American interests.
      Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's War
  Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a
  ""crushing blow.""
      ""The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in
  no way get out safely,"" Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.
      Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid
  ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on
  November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.
      Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in
  Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in
  preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.
      Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab
  states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they
  said.
      ""The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran to
  respond one way or the other,"" a diplomat said.
      President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American
  countermeasures if the military escalation continued.
      Western diplomats and military sources in the area said
  shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act
  the United States could have taken once it had decided to
  retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans
  and Kuwaitis on Iran.
      ""It's interesting that they chose something in international
  waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation,"" one
  diplomat said. ""This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf
  Arab states, particularly Kuwait.""
      Commented another diplomat: ""Kuwait must be happy that the
  U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked
  on its doorstep.""
      One source said of the attack on the oil platform: ""They
  managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the
  least nuisance to everybody.""
      A diplomat commented: ""They were very clever in the place
  they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated
  anything because it wasn't working in the first place.""
      A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke:
  ""This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up
  ... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans).""

  its discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feel

      Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters

      The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to

      The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's
  renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked by
  remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the
  dollar's fall had been orderly.
      They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker's
  comments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since
  the Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span,
  not the currency's recent movements.
      They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize
  on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or
  the other.
      The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more
  weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market
  stability than on other currencies.
      Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangers
  that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would
  reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting the
  U.S. And world economies, they said.
      In February and in March of this year, Japanese investors
  reduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sources
  said.
      Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy,
  Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view about
  currency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said.
      This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a
  triangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen and
  dollar/European currencies.
      At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries did
  not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did

test/17714,Markets,2,"LITTLE REACTION TO REMOVAL COMEX DAILY LIMITS
  The elimination of limits on daily price
  fluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on the
  Commodity Exchange, COMEX, appears to be having little effect
  on the market, analysts said.
      ""There is nothing apparent from the change,"" said William
  O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.
      ""The market has not approached the old price limits and
  trading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,"" he said.
      On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the two
  contracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copper
  and aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations,
  which were severely tested by a volatile market in silver
  futures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the lifting
  of all daily limits, effective today.
      Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per
  ounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the
  nearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said.
      Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most back
  months, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby
  contracts amid quiet trading today.
      During the last week of April, silver futures often traded
  at the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, the
  dollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, or
  unlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said.
      As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many
  unmatched trades, and large losses for some traders.
      The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs
  for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.
      Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,
  said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic
  buying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets.
      O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits would
  add caution to trading.
      ""This is a more realistic approach because the metals
  market is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,""
  O'Neill said.

  The European Community (EC) has

  retaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.
      They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26
  to review the state of trade relations between the two sides.
      The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of
  member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC
  pledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are
  ""adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market.""
      Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing
  stiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese
  exports.
      The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be

  U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said
  the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Tokyo last
  week went further than the U.S. Had expected.
      But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic
  sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo
  changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips.
      Speaking in a televised news conference linking several
  European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the
  Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and
  global demand.
  
      ""There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was
  originally thought,"" said Shultz, speaking from Washington.
      ""It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked
  about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here.
      ""It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe
  that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the
  economy,"" he added.
      But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news
  conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might
  decide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on
  some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied:
      ""These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an
  agreement that had been reached between the United States and
  Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip
  market.
      ""They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the
  agreement that it made become evident.""
      He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the
  situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a
  trend on only one month's data.
      The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal
  computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that
  Japan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by
  selling computer chips at below fair market value.
      Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do
  well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.
      Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to
  take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold
  American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget
  deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the
  problem.
      He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit
  would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against

  Taiwan's imports in the second quarter of
  1987 are expected to rise to 7.75 billion U.S. Dlrs from 5.82
  billion a year earlier and from 6.95 billion in the first
  quarter of this year, the statistics department said.
      A department official attributed the increase to growing
  domestic investment by the private and public sectors. It is
  expected to rise to 4.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from 3.79 billion a
  year earlier and 3.41 billion during the first quarter.
      Taiwan's exports in the April-June quarter are expected to
  rise to 12.03 billion U.S. Dlrs from 9.63 billion a year
  earlier and 11.28 billion in the first quarter.
      The official said Taiwan's trade surplus is expected to
  climb to 4.28 billion U.S. Dlrs in the second quarter of 1987
  from 3.81 billion a year earlier. It was 4.33 billion in the
  first quarter of this year.
      Most of the surplus is expected to come from trade with the
  U.S., Taiwan's largest trading partner and importer of nearly
  50 pct of Taiwan's total exports, he said.
      He said he expected Taiwan's imports, including grains,
  machinery and power plant equipment, from the U.S. To rise
  sharply because of government efforts to balance trade with
  Washington. He declined to give figures.

  The U.K. government hopes for a

      Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to arm

  used against certain Japanese financial institutions.
      Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from
  Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as a
  signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory
  outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc,

  There was no evidence of winterkill

      The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of

      However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have
  promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on

      Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the

  Dutch insurer AEGON NV &lt;AEGN.AS>
  reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln
  guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits
  for 1987.
      Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion
  guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its
  revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a
  change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would
  have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.
      Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly
  due to its life insurance business.
      Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose
  despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and
  higher personal risks.
      Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage
  insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.
      In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and
  life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change
  in accounting for U.S. Annuities.
      AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal
  investment influences that it should be accounted differently
  from the more traditional insurances.
      This change in accounting practice and another change to
  account for profits made on fixed interest investments,
  resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln
  guilders.
      AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits
  were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial
  costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The
  Hague.
      In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged
  in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial
  costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.
      Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in
  May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these
  costs and made only a small contribution to the group's
  profits.
      AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill

  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go
  ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned.
      Asked in a television interview what the chance was for
  Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese
  electronic exports, he said ""slim to none.""
      Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to
  retaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end
  dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than
  cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products.
      Yeutter, on the NBC program ""Today,"" said the United States
  did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop
  the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.
      He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials
  they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take
  time to monitor any compliance.
      Asked how long that would take, he said ""We want to see a
  pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would
  take a few weeks.""
      Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer
  impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods
  because the items selected are also readily available from
  other countries and manufacturers.
      He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.
      ""It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country
  to get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that
  full well,"" Yeutter said.
      He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but ""that's more of a
  paper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any
  adverse impact on U.S. trade.""
      Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor
  issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit
  later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
      He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a
  major issue, would be productive but ""I don't see any practical
  way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his

  Morton Hyman said if oil production by OPEC rises during the

      Hyman, delivering a speech at the annual shareholders
  meeting, said international tanker markets were generally weak
  throughout the first quarter, but since the end of March OPEC
  oil production has picked up. The result has been a modest
  improvement in tanker rates.
      Overseas said 73 pct of its fleet handles liquid cargo.
     
      He said tanker requirements decreased in September 1986 as
  OPEC production quotas dropped and levels of oil stocks rose.
      For the first quarter 1987, the company reported net income
  of 10.3 mln dlrs, or 40 cts per share, compared to 9.3 mln

  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will
  visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S.
  Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats said
  they believed his chances of success were slim.
      Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and
  widespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will be
  hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S.
  President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said.
      News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided
  with news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus
  last month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier.
      It also came one day after the Reagan Administration's
  Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action
  against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint
  trade agreement on computer microchips.
      Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one
  designed to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in the
  short-term, the other to redirect the country in the medium
  term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth.
      But government officials said political infighting could
  rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent
  one from seeing the light of day.
      Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up
  a package of short-term economic measures until after its
  1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would
  amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate.
      But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for
  his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by
  opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan.
      Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the
  U.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling
  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own
  measures.
      He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis
  of the government's plans, without losing face in parliament
  over the budget, political analysts said.
      Officials working on the government's short-term economic
  package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on
  loans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to
  pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in
  the form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment.
      They said a record portion of state investment planned for
  the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first
  half, probably over 80 pct.
      Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy
  Reagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S.
  Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade
  deficit.
      To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also
  likely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term
  economic plans.
      A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan
  governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final
  report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days
  before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington.
      Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to
  Maekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are
  likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as
  agricultural reform and land policy, officials said.
      While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed
  as possible, they said the political realities might force them
  to water down some of the committee's recommendations.
      A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy
  might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes
  massive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee
  projects that the current account surplus will fall to less
  than two pct of Japan's total output, or gross national
  product, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, which
  measures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pct
  of gnp.
      The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for
  Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual
  appreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around
  1993, from 150 now.

  USX Corp chairman David Roderick said
  the company had ended talks with British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP>
  about the possible sale of some energy assets and said USX has
  no immediate restructuring plans for its oil businesses.
      ""We have terminated our discussions,"" Roderick told Reuters
  after a speech to the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association
  here. He said USX was not conducting talks with any other
  possible buyer of its energy assets.
      Earlier today, BP said it planned to offer 70 dlrs per
  share for the Standard Oil Co's &lt;SRD> publicly held stock.
      USX said in December the company had held formal
  discussions with BP about the potential sale of some of its
  overseas oil assets and USX had received expressions of
  interest from a half dozen other oil companies.
      Roderick, in response to a question, said USX had no
  immediate plans to restructure its Marathon Oil Co, or Texas
  Oil and Gas Corp. He said USX also did not plan to sell any of
  its 49 pct interest in the giant Yates Field in west Texas.
      ""We want to maintain our production in the Yates Field
  during these difficult times,"" Roderick added.
      In response to a question, Roderick also said he did not
  know whether Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court was
  accumulating USX stock. In recent days, traders have suggested
  Holmes a Court was buying additional shares.
      Roderick said Carl Ichan, who terminated an eight billion
  dlr hostile takeover plan for USX in January, continued to hold
  a sizable interest in the company. ""Mr. Ichan still apparently
  has 11.4 pct. He hasn't bought any more stock or sold any,""
  Roderick said. ""He's a very satisfied shareholder right now. I
  talk with him monthly.""
      In his speech, Roderick predicted the fall in the value of
  the dollar would set the stage for the U.S. to solve its trade
  deficit problem which totaled 170 billion dlrs in 1986.
      ""I expect by the early 1990s the U.S. will be running a net
  trade surplus,"" Roderick said. ""I think the worst is over and
  we can look forward to stability and upward movement ahead.""
      However, the USX chairman warned that European trading
  partners may resist the turn in the U.S. trade deficit. ""Some
  economic discomfort must be transferred from the United States
  to our friends, trading partners and allies.""

training/1226,Economics,1,"ROSTENKOWSKI RELUCTANT TO BACK TAX HIKE
  House Ways and Means Committee
  Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back
  the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support.
      He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a
  number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought
  a tax increase to help balance the budget.
      However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates
  enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.
      There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the
  1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year.
      Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his
  1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax
  increases.
      On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the
  major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry
  for special protection.
      ""To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide,""
  he said.
      This apparently ruled out congressional approval of another
  textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as was
  proposed again this year.

  Indonesia told the oil industry on
  Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and
  improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased
  expenditure on exploration in return.
      President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian
  Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend
  contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.
      ""In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the
  government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending
  production sharing contracts under the present laws,"" Suharto
  said.
      ""Apart from that, the government will keep improving the
  investment climate in order to accelerate the development of
  the petroleum industry,"" he said.
      Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he
  was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that
  contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be
  renewed before they would invest in further exploration.
      ""As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully
  aware of this situation,"" Subroto said.
      ""The government has already made the political decision to
  entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers
  to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a
  selective basis.""
      Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil
  reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil
  industry sources say.
      Subroto said the government was also working to ease other
  problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or
  deep water conditions.
      But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way
  and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now
  that the oil price had recovered.
      President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of
  technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil
  industry for the regions in which companies operated.
      Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company
  Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production
  expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to
  fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in
  1986.
      Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation
  contracts with foreign oil companies.
      Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field
  operations was a government priority. There had been
  misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry
  in certain areas, such as when a field is designated
  commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.
      He said the government wanted to finalise contract
  extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the
  meantime to maintain its exploration drive.
      Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain
  exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire
  within 10 years. ""This need in itself is some sort of guarantee
  that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement.""
      Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal
  between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.
      Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved
  detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.
      Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions
  would be selective, based on how much capital would be
  invested.

training/11225,Economics,1,"JAPAN TO CUT MICROCHIP OUTPUT, BOOST IMPORTS
  Leading domestic semiconductor makers
  will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips
  from next month in line with government attempts to ward off
  U.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said.
      The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off the
  sanctions, despite obstacles to full implementation of the
  plans, analysts said.
      The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth of
  products and are in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to
  honour a semiconductor trade pact.
      In announcing the sanctions last Friday, President Reagan
  said Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory
  pricing and open Japan's market to foreign products.
      But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter said
  yesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to drop
  the tariffs if Japan shows a ""clear indication"" that it will open
  its markets to U.S. Goods.
      The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has
  urged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in the
  second quarter, following a call to reduce production by more
  than 20 pct the previous quarter.
      MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports.
      Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington to
  cancel the tariffs ahead of next month's meeting between Prime
  Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan.
      ""The U.S. Wants to be satisfied. It has rattled its sword
  and shown that it can and will do business,"" said analyst Nick
  Edwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo.
      But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers can
  cut output, boosting imports -- the key to U.S. Withdrawal of
  the sanctions -- is more difficult.
      ""The U.S. Does not have the low-end consumer IC's
  (integrated circuits) that the Japanese need for consumer
  products. They're well supplied here,"" said Richard May, senior
  analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo.
      The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high-end IC's,
  but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high-end
  production skills, the analysts said.
      ""The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses on
  semiconductors in return for free access to other areas,"" said
  Edwards.
      A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT.T>, said the firm's
  reduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory
  (256K DRAM) was unrelated to MITI's efforts to ward off the
  trade sanctions. Decreased production was a natural result of
  the company increasing output of one-mln bit DRAM's, he said.
      Company officials unveiled the following plans -
      - NEC Corp &lt;NESI.T>, Japan's largest chipmaker, plans to
  slash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct to
  six mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln last
  quarter.
       In the year beginning April 1, NEC will boost chip
  imports, which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chip
  consumption the year before.
      - Hitachi Ltd's &lt;HIT.T> April output of 256K DRAM's will
  fall by 25.93 pct to four mln compared to 5.4 mln in March. The
  company is trying to boost imports but has not set a specific
  target. Imports are currently very low.
      - Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> will reduce April 256K DRAM
  production by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and is
  considering ways to boost imports, a company official said.
      Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc (MOT.N) to sell
  the U.S. Firm's chips in Japan. The firms are planning a
  joint-venture production of memory chips in Sendai, northern
  Japan.
      - Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MIET.T) will trim second
  quarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mln
  chips compared to the first quarter. Plans call for increased
  imports but an official said ""boosting imports will be difficult
  as it depends on sales demand.""
      - Fujitsu Ltd (ITSU.T) will cut production in accord with
  MITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels.
      - Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd (OKIE.T) will reduce April
  production by 10 pct from March's 3.2 mln. Oki is studying ways
  to increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginning
  April 1 from the previous year's total of more than five
  billion yen, a company official said.

  The United States has appealed for
  stronger powers for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  (GATT) to enforce world trade rules.
      The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith
  at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows
  a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by
  the 93-nation body to promote fair trade.
      Today's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round
  launched by ministers last September. The round, which covers
  13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods and
  services will take four years to negotiate.
      Smith called for boosting GATT's links with financial
  institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World
  Bank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to
  ensure the success of the Uruguay Round.
      ""The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to
  assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the
  world trading system and the global economy,"" Smith said.
      ""Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak,
  or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy.""
      He also also urged that member states be accountable to
  each other for their trade policies.
      Smith, who flies to Brussels today for talks with European
  Community (EC) officials, told Reuters the committee wanted to
  stress GATT's importance and did not discuss specifics.
      ""We are interested in more periodic ministerial
  involvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings,"" he said.
      GATT's ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the
  12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord on
  semiconductors. The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade
  rules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese
  chips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute
  panel be set up to review the agreement.
      President Reagan, who strongly supported the Uruguay trade
  round to promote freer trade, has said Washington will impose
  tariffs against Japanese electronic goods.

  Canadian economic growth is expected to
  slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should

      ""The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth
  over the course of 1987,"" said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at
  Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd.
      Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product,
  grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion,
  but down from 1985's four pct.
      In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized
  rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the
  third quarter.
      ""Essentially it is a flat performance,"" said Warren Jestin,
  deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.
      Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson
  Bongard Inc said ""it shows the economy is not moving along very
  steadily, it's not a very promising number.""
      ""We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter
  in Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession,"" she
  added.
      The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by
  Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last
  month. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this
  year.
      Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will
  likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range.
      Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade
  performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in
  the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs
  from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.
      ""The sharp increase in the deficit originated from
  merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to
  advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged,"" the
  federal agency said in a statement.
      The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion
  dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.
      But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S.
  economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and
  help fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of
  Canada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year.

  in 1986, Chris Clark, platinum marketing director for Johnson
  Matthey Plc said.
      Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisation
  in Milton Keynes he foresaw a 250,000 ounce increase in
  consumption for use in autocatalysts, currently the largest
  single application for platinum.
      Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70,000 ounces,
  Clark predicted in his speech, the text of which was released
  in London today.
      Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest further
  increase in investment buying and may well be cautious.
      He said South Africa was the most likely source of
  additional supplies and will need to increase output by about
  500,000 ounces to meet increased demand.
      The capital investment required to produce the additional
  output would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the political
  climate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said.
      The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the
  1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces,
  Clark said.
      ""The very probability of a growth in demand set against the
  massive investment required for expansion - and that expansion
  only being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me to
  conclude that the price of platinum will be substantially
  underpinned in the medium to long-term,"" Clark said.

  U.S. military planners ruled out
  Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack
  mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the
  Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.
      U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and
  raided another in what the administration called a ""measured and
  appropriate response"" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last
  Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.
      Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig
  rather than an onshore economic or military target such as
  Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to
  limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at
  home and in the Gulf.
      ""It simply demonstrated the United States will take military
  action when they (Iran) take military action,"" Norman Polmar, a
  defense analyst and author, said.
      He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the
  embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding
  an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.
      In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the
  potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that
  could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.
      Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq
  war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target
  to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General
  Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a
  Security Council call for a ceasefire.
      ""We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any
  chance at all,"" he said, adding that the action made it clear
  tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.
  
     In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon
  to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington
  also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's
  economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had
  been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the
  lower Gulf.
      ""We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown
  Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting
  capabilities,"" Cordesman said.
      He predicted the United States would respond to any future
  major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar
  Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the
  approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.
      Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the
  United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, ""but
  we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action
  by Iran with stronger countermeasures.""

test/20048,Economics,1,"TOKYO STOCK PLUNGE COULD FORCE EASIER MONEY POLICY
  Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent
  the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even
  force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,
  government and private economists said.
      A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark
  further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major
  deflationary impact on the real economy, they said.
      Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently
  maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount
  rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise. 
      Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the
  central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance
  higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.
      But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15
  pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to
  raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a
  renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.
      Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the
  markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded
  the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount
  rate increase.
      A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.
  And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a
  further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. ""They need to
  support the stock and security markets,"" he said.
      But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change
  policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central
  bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices
  continue to plunge during the rest of the week.
      Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the
  economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary
  impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.
      With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in
  stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and
  business confidence, one government economist said.
      ""There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't
  be that big,"" said another.
      Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their
  own, although they do participate through trust funds and other
  investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned
  to financial market investments for profits during last year's
  economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to
  refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.
      Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is
  partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have
  shifted funds away from financial investments to increase
  inventories and step up capital spending, one government
  economist said.
      In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price
  drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices
  will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a
  greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,
  one central bank official said. ""That will at least take a
  couple of days, if not weeks,"" he said.

  The elimination of price limits on
  precious metals contracts trading at the Commodity Exchange in
  New York appears to be having little effect on the market,
  analysts said.
      ""There is nothing apparent from the change,"" said William
  O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.
  ""The market has not approached the old price limits and trading
  is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,"" he added.
      Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs on
  market moves in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker
  in the nearby contracts amid thin conditions, traders said.
      On May 5, COMEX did away with price limits on the two
  contracts following spot after a volatile market in silver
  futures at the end of April caused severe disruptions.
      During the last week of April, silver futures traded up and
  down the price limit in the back months, causing traders to
  rush into the spot contract to offset those moves, analysts
  said.  As a result, Elders' O'Neill said, there was much
  confusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses.
      The COMEX fined Elders Futures and three other large firms
  a total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades
  in a timely manner.
      Silver futures were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the
  nearby contracts amid quiet trading today.
      O'Neill said the elimination of price limits on all COMEX
  metals futures would add caution to trading since all contracts
  could move any distance.
      ""This is amore realistic approach because the metals market
  is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,""
  O'Neill said.
      Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,
  said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic

training/227,Economics,1,"AUSTRALIA'S KEATING CHANGES ECONOMIC FORECASTS
  Domestic demand is now expected to make
  no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal
  1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all
  of the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here.
      However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic
  Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise
  in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised.
      But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this
  financial year and net export growth will provide the total
  source of gdp growth.
      The August budget had forecast domestic demand would
  contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5
  pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.
      Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic
  parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a
  slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit
  than first anticipated.
      ""The government initially forecast a current account deficit
  for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that
  the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion,"" he said.
      Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC
  in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is
  broadly on track, Keating said.
      ""They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more
  sluggish than was expected at budget time,"" he said.
      ""On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more
  than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth
  in domestic production and employment.""
      Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation
  rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.
      ""Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in
  inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary
  effects wane,"" he said.
      Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick
  up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in
  net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from
  private domestic demand.
      He said domestic demand growth will be due to a
  strengthening in real household disposable income.
      The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year
  should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level
  broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.
      ""The current account deficit will continue to show
  improvement in 1987/88,"" Keating said.
      ""As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent
  years recede further, and given continued effective wage
  restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88,"" he
  said.

      U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February,
  twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a
  319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously
  reported 448,000 increase.
      ""Even if you look at January and February together, this is
  still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in
  the market,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation.
      Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much
  larger gains in February U.S. production and income than
  previously forecast.
      The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from
  34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose
  0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since
  November 1966, the Commerce Department said.
      ""The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very
  large increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7
  pct,"" said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4
  pct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.
      Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc
  noted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour
  in February from 8.83 dlrs in January.
      ""Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means
  we'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis
  the wage and salary disbursement,"" he said.
      Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should
  rise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.
      He said the February employment gains are consistent with
  his firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national product
  growth forecast of 3.7 pct.
      Economists agreed that the employment data were negative
  for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy
  and no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. But
  most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.
      ""This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider
  easing,"" said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.  
    ""It gives them more room to address the dollar situation,"" he
  said. ""If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so,
  but it's most likely they'll sit and wait.""
      ""The data have not been uniform,"" Stone added. ""Durable
  goods were weak in January and now employment is strong.""
      In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct,
  followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S.
  retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap
  widened to 14.8 billion dlrs.

  goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first
  quarter GNP growth of one pct,"" he said.
      ""The employment and production data point to a big
  inventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourth
  quarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth.""
      Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000
  in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was
  accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery
  industries returning to work.
      Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains
  have resulted from an improving trade outlook.
      Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S.
  trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports
  grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in
  imports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve
  in the first quarter.
      ""Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter,
  but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper
  products, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show
  that trade is improving,"" Benderley said.
      ""The economy is moving between extremes,"" he said. ""Some
  reports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter
  GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct.""
      A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater
  part of February's employment gain. Retail services employment
  rose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in
  January, previously reported at 166,000.
      Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But
  this follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down
  from a previously reported 142,000 gain.
      The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in
  February at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at
  6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since
  March 1980, the Commerce Department noted.
      ""The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,""
  Carson said. ""This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease,
  but there's no reason to tighten. It's way too early for that.""

  Soviet Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told
  the Supreme Soviet (parliament) industrial output is planned to
  rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a planned 4.4 pct in 1987.
      In the first nine months of this year, industrial output
  rose by 3.6 pct.
      Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent
  to gross national product, is planned to rise by 4.3 pct
  against a planned 4.1 pct this year.
      He said grain production is planned at 235 mln tonnes in
  1988, compared with a planned 232 mln this year.
      The Soviet Union produced 210 mln tonnes of grain in 1986
  and the Soviet press has said heavy rain has affected the
  harvest this year.
      Talyzin said the 1988 Soviet plan stressed the engineering
  industry, which Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described
  as a sector where rapid modernisation is essential if the
  Soviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets.
      ""Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the
  machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a
  considerable amount of the equipment that it requires,"" said
  Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee Gosplan.
      Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes
  machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,
  increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of this
  year against the same period of 1986. This is well below the
  7.3 pct rise planned for the industry for all of 1988.
      Talyzin said the ruling Politburo concluded at a recent
  meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to
  a large extent on conserving resources better. ""Large-scale
  measures are planned to save resources,"" he said.
      Finance Minister Boris Gustev told the Supreme Soviet
  defence spending in 1988 would total 20.2 billion roubles, the
  same as announced last year.
      Talyzin said the Kremlin also had decided to increase
  spending next year on medical services, education, pensions and
  social insurance schemes
      He said state expenditures in these fields would reach 171
  billion roubles in 1988, or 3.5 billion roubles more than had

  The British government may revoke the
  licences of selected Japanese banks and securities companies
  operating in London's financial City when they come up for
  renewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening up
  Japan's markets to foreign competition, government sources
  said.
      ""We can't say ""yes, we are going to do it (revoke licences)""
  but this is definitely being considered,"" an official said.
      His comments came after the government was formally urged
  today by a cross-section of influential MPs to take joint
  retaliatory action with the United States against Japan.
      Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanese
  trade practices. ""There's a sense of urgency here now, but the
  emphasis is on securing - not undermining - our interests in
  Japan,"" another government official told Reuters.
      Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday that
  Britain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in the
  Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliate
  against countries that do not offer reciprocal market access.
      She clearly had Japan in mind, government sources said.
      The U.K. Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 3.7
  billion stg, official figures show.
      A parliamentary motion, signed by 98 MPs, today urged the
  U.K. Government to ""coordinate action with the President of the
  United States, and through the Department of Trade and
  Industry, to suspend all further applications from Japanese
  communications companies for equipment approval by the British
  Approvals Board for Telecommunications, and all further
  applications from Japanese financial institutions for licences""
  until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called
  ""restrictive conditions"" on the bid by (Cable and Wireless PLC)
  (cawl.L) and its U.S. And Japanese partners for a stake in
  Japan's international telecommunications market.
      The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-section
  of MPs, reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament.
  Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure on
  the Conservative government to take firm action.
      Officials said another option now being considered by the
  U.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japanese
  institutions. That could be done under the government's
  proposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament.
      58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal
  in London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-based
  firms are authorised to do financial business, officials said.
      The new financial services and banking acts offer Britain
  an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied
  under legally-binding international trade agreements.
      ""The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and Industry
  Secretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging in
  investment, banking and insurance,"" one official said.
      ""This point has been made to the Japanese at official level
  a number times,"" the official added.
      Britain and France are now working together to urge that
  the European Community take collective action against Japan,
  but by working within EC treaties, another official said.
      British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radio
  interview that the European Community should build barriers
  against Japanese imports through certification procedures
  similar to those facing European exporters in Japan.
      ""There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer,"" he
  said, adding ""(such barriers) can't be put in place overnight.""
  Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade
  ""strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have a
  fair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which is
  itself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of our
  own domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness.""
      The situation is only likely to worsen following news that
  Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more
  than 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrs
  from 5.7 billion in January, political sources said.
      But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visible
  trade and access to financial markets should be kept separate.
      Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financial
  institutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, rather
  than larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a global
  business centre, government sources said. Japan's four largest
  securities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange.
      In Washington, White House officials said President Reagan
  was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for
  breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States.
      There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on
  the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb
  Japanese exports to the United States but officials said the
  move could come today or early next week.
      Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan
  included tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which
  use semiconductors.

  Amid new concerns about inflation,
  interest rate increases and trade confrontations,
  finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss
  a deteriorating global debt and economic situation.
      The meetings, under the auspices of the International
  Monetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates are
  turning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further,
  upsetting bond and stock markets.
      Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global
  economy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continue
  to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new
  assistance.
      Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs
  any new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury Secretary
  James Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works.
      The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil,
  which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs of
  commercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded by
  laying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans.
      Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in a
  visit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out the
  administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to
  the very poorest states.
      The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers
  in detail during next week's meetings and will undoubtedly be
  embraced by the developing countries.
      ""There's interest on the part of some countries for looking
  at the support of the special problems of the very poorest
  countries, because their position is so extreme,"" a Reagan
  administration official said.
      He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue.
      The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debt
  initiative, which called for new funding to help debtor
  countries grow out of their problems.
      The largest industrial countries have been attempting to
  coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the
  decline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and other
  problems.
      At the same time, the industrial countries see little
  evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fund
  forecasts they will grow 2.5 pct.
      The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself, 
  continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked other
  industrial countries to stimulate their economies.
      These issues directly affect the debt problem and the
  ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their
  difficulties.
      In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports of
  developing country, allowing them to earn critical foreign
  exchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit,
  running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing others
  to import more from developing countries.
      The discussions, from April six to 10, will be
  wide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to the
  impact of development loans on the environment, according to
  monetary sources.
      The talks will include an examination of trade
  protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reagan
  administration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on
  microchip products from Japan, the sources said.
      The move accelerated the dollar's decline as financial
  markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing.
      There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. charges
  that Japan has been selling computer chip products below fair
  market value and has kept its own market closed to imports,
  further undermining the international trading system.
      At the same time, the ministers will discuss the
  fundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the export
  mainstay of many developing countries.
      The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- the
  United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- will
  gather for the first time since their February talks in Paris,
  where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further.
      The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada for
  further debate on economic policy coordination.
      As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such as
  Japan agreed to stimulate their economies, while America
  said it would reduce its federal budget deficit.
      Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to to
  have a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-American
  Development Bank, strengthening the link between loans and
  economic policy changes in debtor nations.
      Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take more
  account of the environment when making loan for dams and other
  projects.
      The new head of the Bank, Barber Conable, has said this
  issue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganization
  plan for the Bank, now being prepared.

  Treasury Secretary James Baker said
  the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as
  had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances
  from emerging in the global economy.
      In remarks before the afternoon session of the
  International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said he
  was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.
      ""But I do suggest,"" he said, ""that we need something to give
  it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction
  when the wind shifts.""
      He said that indicators can serve ""as a kind of compass"" but
  added that structural indicators can help focus attention on
  some policies.
      Baker, however, said the IMF ""needs to move beyond
  macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that
  can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific
  relevance to the imbalances we face today.""
      The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given
  a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article
  IV consultations -- that the Fund performs.
      Baker also told the policy making group that it was time
  for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF
  surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the
  public.
      ""In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF
  appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of
  follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF
  recommendations, and greater use of special consultation
  procedures,"" he said.
      Baker emphasized that indicators were a device ""for moving
  beyond rhetoric to action.""
      He said they provide ""more structure to the system, and
  induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of
  policy coordination.""
      He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be
  reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.
      ""This should be matter of priority for the executive board,""
  he said.
      Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative
  medium-term economic scenarios for countries that ""can help us
  focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by
  identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the
  implications of these options.""
      He said also that further work should be done on finding
  paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.

  significant deviations from an intended course, then we must

training/11083,Economics,1,"FED'S POLICY EASE MAY END WITH 2ND QTR RATE CUT
  The Federal Reserve's move to easier
  monetary policy, begun with four quick half-point discount rate
  cuts in 1986, will likely end with a final rate drop in the
  second quarter, analysts said.
      A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to
  edge lower, with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending rate
  from 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy.
      ""The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further without
  a full-blown recession,"" said Raymond Stone, chief financial
  economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
      Stone said economic data available by late June may be just
  weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut. But he said
  it may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual half
  point, to avoid hurting the dollar further.
      All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open Market
  Committee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged.
      The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly
  quarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasury
  bond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at which
  banks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the prime
  lending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct.
      Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly to
  the April-June quarter, follow:
      - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further
  against other major currencies because of a large U.S. budget
  deficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted after
  the dollar's steep drop in the last two business days, the
  economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that
  the dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect.
      - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue
  trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well
  test the lower end of that range.
      - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and
  probably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strong
  foreign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. The
  outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year
  since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up.
      - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator
  will rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. The
  sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as will
  a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year.
      - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pct
  annual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand at
  respective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 first
  and second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pct
  annual
  rate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter.
      Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International sees
  both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among
  those surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pct
  rate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate this
  quarter and 3.5 pct next quarter.
      ""The economy will bounce back more strongly than many
  expect,"" Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup in
  inventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quarter
  economic growth, with consumer spending helping later.
      ""We're running out of special factors to keep the economy
  afloat,"" said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. His
  interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest.
      Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation
  helped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively.
  He expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that second
  quarter growth could be zero or negative.
      Braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer
  from a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow 
  government spending and less construction. Only a marginally
  narrower trade deficit will add to growth.
      He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds,
  with Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct,
  respectively. Nikko's Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct for
  bonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate.
      Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly
  after the dollar's fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in past
  days and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan.
      David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Inc
  raised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20
  pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct.
      Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, lifted
  his forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a point
  to eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds. Both Nicho and
  Resler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct.
      The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japanese
  investors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fear
  about further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S.
  trade sanctions. Yields may have to rise to lure other buyers.

  The tough trade sanctions President
  Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across
  Japan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade
  practices worldwide, U.S. officials said.
      But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings
  Institution, a think tank, said ""a shot across their bow can
  often result in a shot in our stern.""
      He said it left the United States open to retaliation.
      The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered
  on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress
  that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws,
  and no new protectionist legislation is needed.
      In the past year tough trade action had been taken against
  the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer
  and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights,
  patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.
      White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the
  tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a ""serious signal""
  to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.
      Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers,
  television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor
  an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at
  less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The
  tariffs were placed on items which were available from other
  sources so there would be little effect on the American
  consumer, Fitzwater said.
      Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action
  - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade
  practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.
      The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.
      The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion
  dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about
  one-third of America's overall deficit.
      But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West
  Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the
  president is ready to fight them all.
      Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that ""I regret
  that these actions are necessary,"" but that the health and
  vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to
  American competitiveness in world markets.
      ""We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading
  practices,"" Reagan added in the statement from his California
  vacation home at Santa Barbara.
      He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan
  abided by the agreement.
      U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -

  U.S. and U.K. bank regulators are asking
  banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion
  them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency
  swap transactions they carry, swap dealers said.
      After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by
  the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board, dealers said
  that in effect, regulators are asking them to set aside
  reserves twice for the same risk.
      Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the
  proposals.
      Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially
  significant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volume
  of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled
  by Euromoney magazine. While no firm figures exist, dealers in
  eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved
  in some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that
  about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are
  outstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of the
  International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of
  Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association
  has no comment and will study the proposals.
      ""What they are proposing is really double counting,"" Patrick
  de Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley
  and Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either be
  required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct
  per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of
  replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default.
      ""The potential risk factors are very large relative to what
  we had expected,"" said a director at one U.K. merchant bank.
  ""What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now --
  to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might
  have 10 years from now,"" he added.(Adds title first paragraph).
      Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by
  the agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a
  competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the
  costs on to customers.
      Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the
  exclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal
  Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the
  proposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that
  Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new
  capital rules.
       Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank
  regulators recognized the concept of netting, that is,
  offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single
  counterparty against each other.
      The paper said that regulatory authorities ""recognize that
  such arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce
  credit risk."" Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting
  agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it
  might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly.
      But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an
  airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design.
       ""One problem is that there has never been a major default
  in the swaps market. So we don't know if any of the swap
  arrangements will really stand up in court,"" said one bank
  official.

  The acting governor of Saudi Arabia's

  retired at his own request, oil industry sources said.
      They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation
  planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.
      Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher,
  left in a major oil industry shake up last December.
      The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the
  post permanently.
      The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki
  Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry
  sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil
  market.
      The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20
  years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi
  Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned
  to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.
      Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an
  OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel
  last December.
      Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations
  which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia
  does business, the sources said.
      The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's
  job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who
  earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of
  Petroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister

  year ending April 30, 1987 it will earn about 73 mln dlrs, or
  about 5.15-5.35 dlrs a share on sales of about 500 mln dlrs.
      In the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs,
  or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs.
      Winston Wallin, Medtronic chairman, said the company will
  improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and
  expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line.
      Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per
  share estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will have
  heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988.
      He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its
  businesses and not in its dividends. ""Shareholders are better
  off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends
  or share repurchases,"" he said.
      Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the total

  from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.
      He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic
  products, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters and
  lasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will
  double that by 1995.
      Wallin said, ""Our objective is to get a hold of new
  products and start building market share if we have to beg,
  borrow or steal to get into new markets.""
      In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued with
  a number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulators
  also have criticized the industry, citing quality problems and
  a needless overprescription of pacemakers.
      ""We have no knowledge of any major problems in our
  pacemakers or leads,"" Wallin said. ""We intend to re-establish
  our company as the quality leader in the industry.""
      Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, said
  the company intends to diversify internally and through
  acquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise,
  such as drug delivery systems.
      Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 does
  not include dilutions from acquisitions. ""We hope to have some
  safety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutions
  from an acquisition.""
      Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivity

  As official Washington sought to
  restore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street
  collapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from
  critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.
      Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for
  boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an
  international accord to stabilize currency values.
      Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was
  among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped
  spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors
  think that a clash between the two major economic powers would
  damage the world economy.
      Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, ""I
  think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, I
  think, was partly due to statements that have been made by
  senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic."" It was a
  dispute that should never have happened, he added.
      Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a
  hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  
  still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United
  States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to
  Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.
      Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, ""His
  timing could not have been worse.""
      One government bond salesman in New York said, ""He actually
  thought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack
  the dollar down would work. That doesn't show much
  understanding of international monetary gamesmanship.""
      However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march
  toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.
      ""On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if
  you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial
  markets), it was West German policy,"" said Robert Brusca of
  Nikko Securities International in New York.
      ""All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so
  making him responsible for it was a little like killing the
  messenger,"" he said.
      After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments
  made it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together
  in Paris in February, was still in effect.
      Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be
  a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to
  the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash
  wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.
     Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about
  Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the
  global recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest
  rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.
      He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th
  month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic
  expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge
  market for debtor country exports.
      Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried
  that the Republican party might face next year's presidential
  election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly
  tarnished.
      A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt
  crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has
  already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.
      ""There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the
  economy, and it's important that the psychology turn around
  quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and
  eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,""
  former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a
  television interview.
      In many ways, the official response was mild.
      Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,
  with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting
  that he was ""puzzled.""
      U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately
  returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments
  and, presumably, their political impact.
      For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in
  Washington will diminish because of the market fall.
      Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because
  of the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd
  Bentsen said with some irony, ""Oh, I think it's much too late to
  be doing that...You have an administration that's taken the
  attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---

  being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.
      The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented

  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may have
  been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen's renewed rapid
  rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States,
  political analysts said.
      Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reform
  plan, may now be forced to resign before the June economic
  summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later
  next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal
  Democratic Party (LDP), they said.
      ""The close relationship between Nakasone and President
  Reagan was an important element of Nakasone's power base,""
  Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida
  told Reuters. ""So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damages
  Nakasone.""
      Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone was
  encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but
  also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax.
      ""Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from
  Nakasone,"" Uchida said. ""His position within the LDP itself is
  not so strongly established today.""
      Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general public
  than with many LDP members, is now seeing his public support
  eroded, the analysts said.
      The yen's rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat on
  Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in
  retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a microchip trade
  pact are now giving Nakasone's critics fresh ammunition, the
  analysts said.
      ""Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and
  Nakasone hasn't worked effectively,"" Rei Shiratori, director of
  the Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said.
      This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone's
  credibility, Shiratori told Reuters.
      The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen's
  rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses
  in the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said.
      ""If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have to
  resign early,"" Shiratori said.
      But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempers
  before or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29,
  some analysts said.
      However, ""unless the Japanese political system can move more
  quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to
  Washington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a very
  hostile audience,"" said Merrill Lynch Securities economist
  William Sterling.
      ""If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put the
  final nail in his coffin,"" he said.
      Reagan's own weakened domestic position, and growing
  Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argue
  against a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analysts
  said.
      But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupled
  with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to
  Nakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over the
  differences and aid Nakasone, they said.
      ""One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is
  not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave,"" Sterling said.

      The company said that it added about four pct to production
  bringing it to 1.8 mln bpd, the highest level since 1979, based
  largely on increased production of oil overseas but additions
  to its reserves from new discoveries and reserve acquisitions
  did not replace all of the oil and gas produced.
      The company said that the average price for oil and gas
  declined 41 pct in 1986 from the previous year sparking a 38
  pct decline in its earnings from exploration and production.
      Exxon's earnings from exploration and production in 1986
  fell to 3.1 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.
      Exxon said that its principal gains in production came from
  the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the North Sea, Malaysia and from
  oil sands in Canada.
      Exxon also said that it acquired 11.2 mln acres for
  expoloration spread over 10 countries including the U.S, Europe
  and the Far East.
      But capital expenditures for exploration and production
  were cut to 4.6 billion dlrs from 7.6 billion the previous year

  liquids produced from offshore fields in the North Sea reached
  a new high of 422,000 bpd.
      The light, sweet crudes produced from these North Sea
  fields also gave the company trading gains as Exxon was able to
  sell much of this crude and replace it with cheaper, lower
  quality crude oil for its refineries which have been upgraded
  over the past several years.
      The trading gains and lower acquisition costs gave Exxon
  more of a spread in its refinery operations and added to
  earnings gains from refining and marketing.
      Exxon said earnings from refining and marketing operations
  rose to nearly two billion dlrs in 1986, up from 872 mln dlrs

  difficult international economic climate facing export
  industry.
      The centre repeated its previous forecast that growth in
  Swiss domestic product would slow to 2.2 pct in 1987 from 2.5
  pct in 1986. It revised its forecast for 1988 GDP growth to 1.7
  pct from 1.6 pct in its last autumn review.
      Domestic demand will continue to replace exports as the
  motor of economic growth. Private consumption will grow by
  three pct in 1987 and two pct in 1988 against 3.75 pct in 1986.
      Growth in goods exports will slow to 1.75 pct in 1987 from
  2.1 pct in 1986 but pick up slightly to 2.5 pct in 1988. All
  three figures are well below the Swiss average for recent
  years. In 1985, for example, exports increased by 9.1 pct.
      The centre said the strength of the Swiss franc, which has
  firmed sharply in recent months, would continue to put pressure
  on Swiss exporters.
      It forecast that imports of goods would grow by a more
  modest 4.5 pct in 1987 and 3.25 pct in 1988 than in 1986, when
  import prices fell substantially and imports rose by 8.2 pct.
      Industrial production will grow by 1.6 pct in 1987 and 1.2
  pct in 1988 compared with 4.2 pct in 1986.

  Foster Wheeler Corp &lt;FWC> said an

  ""substantial discrepancies"" in Stearns accounts that may
  require material adjustments to previously announce
  consolidated results of the company and its subsidiaries.
      Foster said certain Stearn officers and senior management
  made Stearn's operations appear more profitable than they were
  by improperly recording job costs. It said Stearn's president
  and controller had resigned. A Foster spokesman said he did not
  know the names of the president and controller, and could not
  immediately comment on the release.
      Foster said the amount involved in the ""discrepancy"" is
  about 13.7 mln dlrs before taxes or about 8.2 mln dlrs net
  after tax due to an ""improper recording of job costs over a
  period of several years and continuing through part of the
  first quarter of 1987.""
      Stearns is a unit of Foster's Conergic Corp subsidiary.
  The company said the impact on its results for 1987 was not
  ""likely to be significant"" but the amount to be charged to
  prior periods had not been determined.
      Foster reported after tax earnings of 28 mln dlrs, 26 mln

  The U.S. Congress is making Japan,
  with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of the
  U.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around
  America's record trade deficit.
      ""Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: the
  challenge to our high technology industries, the threat of
  government nutured competition, and the multitude of barriers
  to our exports,"" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said.
      ""If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade
  problems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries,""
  the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee
  hearing on the trade bill.
      Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, have
  made trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-ranging
  bill is being readied for probable House approval next month.
      Japan's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs
  in 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14
  billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January.
      Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade
  deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to
  the dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason to
  press Japan to buy more U.S. goods.
      They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration
  in U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology.
      In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S.
  semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he
  intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese
  electronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide by
  a 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement.
      Congress also has been been angered by the administration's
  lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues
  including beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications
  goods, and financial services.
      The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in
  four committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and
  measures to force the administration take tough action against
  foreign trade barriers and unfair competition.
      Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many
  cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese
  products or make them more expensive with higher duties.
      The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House
  Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to
  force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign
  competition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win
  temporary relief from surges in imports.
      The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict
  imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not
  buy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House.
      Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirant
  from Missouri, has the support of Wright and other key
  Democrats to press for passage of the amendment.
      The measure would have the most impact on Japan, West
  Germany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, does
  not reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States would
  set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per
  cent a year for three years.
      ""I'm tired of going into companies and having managers say
  to me, 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can't
  compete in the marketplace.' That argument needs to be taken
  away from American business,"" Gephardt said.
      The administration has said it could not support a trade
  bill containing such a provision.

  Indonesia has minimised the economic
  impact of falling oil prices, kept inflation within limits and
  boosted exports, Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said.
      Indonesia was badly hit by last year's steep plunge in
  crude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half.
      But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling
  President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in
  the financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct the
  previous year.
      Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said,
  although he did not give complete figures.
      The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general
  elections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber,
  palm oil, tin, timber and coffee.
      Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of the
  appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against
  the dollar, which increased Indonesia's debt repayments.
      He said the economy would have suffered more from the world
  economic recession if the government had not devalued the
  rupiah by 31 pct last September.
      In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Post
  said the government must press ahead with measures to
  deregulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports.
      The English-language daily said bigger export earnings were
  needed to finance not only imports but also the country's
  growing foreign debt, estimated at around 37 billion dlrs.
      ""About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due
  within the next three to five years and will steadily increase
  the debt servicing burden,"" the paper said.
      However, end-investors were seen bargain hunting in

  Bundesbank council member Lothar
  Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy
  and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean
  pushing up interest rates.
      Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitung
  financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account
  exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be
  confused with an exchange rate oriented policy.
      The article followed international press speculation that
  the Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour
  of an exchange rate policy.
      Mueller, a member of the Bundesbank council in his position
  as president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria,
  noted that the Bundesbank's decision in January to cut leading
  interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led
  some people to think it was dropping monetary targetting.
      ""Simply to ignore the external economic context would be
  risky and dangerous for monetary policy,"" he explained.
      Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an
  end to interest rate speculation. The Bundesbank could now
  assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency
  inflows slow down.
      Lower money market rates, achieved by widening short and
  long term interest rate differentials, also encouraged
  investors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts, Mueller
  said.
      The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary
  growth back onto the desired path, he said.
      ""Finally, of course, and there is no need to keep this
  quiet, the cut in interest rates was also in line with the
  changed economic situation of the last few months,"" he added.
      ""All in all, the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money
  supply policy with the January discount rate cut, despite
  suppositions to the contrary,"" Mueller said.
      ""Keeping money supply developments in check is not always
  synonymous with raising interest rates, especially when
  excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad, rather than
  growth in bank credits, is the cause of rising monetary
  holdings of non-banks,"" Mueller said.
      Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits
  other concepts were needed for monetary policy.
      Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for
  monetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate.
      In any case, the exchange rate partly depends on U.S.
  Currency and budgetary policy and the U.S. Economy, he said.
      But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of
  a strict stability policy because both interest rates and
  liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention
  and could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank.
      Even interest rates are not in the centre of the
  Bundesbank's considerations, but reflect competition and other
  market conditions, Mueller said.
      A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central
  bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main money supply indicator.
      This does not reflect banking liquidity, but the liquidity
  of industry and households which cannot be directly reached
  with the Bundesbank's instruments, Mueller said.
      The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits, the
  harder it is to steer money supply. This has increasingly been
  the case recently, because non-banks have received considerable
  sums from current account surpluses and capital imports.
      ""If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise
  with higher interest rates, as would have been appropriate if
  credit was growing excessively, it would not only have missed
  its target but probably even set off further inflows,"" he said.
      Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high.
      In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate
  of seven pct, down from 10 pct in the previous quarter.
      The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to
  six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock
  growth, pointing to the success of the current policy, he said.
      But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there
  should be no change in priorities. ""Monetary policy must be
  first and foremost stability policy and successful stability
  policy is money supply policy -- nothing else,"" he said.

  opened, dealers said.
      Just before the opening, the dollar dropped swiftly as
  speculators concluded the Group of Seven (G-7) comminuique
  issued in Washington contained nothing basically new, they
  said. It fell about a half yen, to around 145.
      The G-7 reaffirmed that their currencies around current
  levels reflect economic fundamentals.
      One dealer said the Bank of Japan probably intervened in
  Australia before the opening here, but could not confirm this.

training/10367,Markets,2,"SUGAR MARKET SEES GOOD RECENT OFFTAKE
  Reports the Soviet Union has lately
  extended its recent buying programme by taking five to eight
  raws cargoes from the free market at around 30/40 points under
  New York May futures highlight recent worldwide demand for
  sugar for a variety of destinations, traders said.
      The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India,
  Turkey and Libya, as well as possible raws offtake by China.
      Some 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes could have changed hands in
  current activity, which is encouraging for a sugar trade which
  previously saw little worthwhile end-buyer enquiry, they added.
      Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the Soviet
  Union in the past few days involved Japanese operators selling
  Thai origin sugar.
      Prices for nearby shipment Thai sugars have tightened
  considerably recently due to good Far Eastern demand, possibly
  for sales to the Soviet Union or to pre-empt any large block
  enquiries by China, they said.
      Thai prices for March/May 15 shipments have hardened to
  around 13/14 points under May New York from larger discounts
  previously, they added.
      Traders said the Soviet Union might be looking to buy more
  sugar in the near term, possibly towards an overall requirement
  this year of around two mln tonnes. It is probable that some
  1.8 mln tonnes have already been taken up, they said.
      Turkey was reported this week to have bought around 100,000
  tonnes of whites while India had further whites purchases of
  two to three cargoes for Mar/Apr at near 227 dlrs a tonne cost
  and freight and could be seeking more. Libya was also a buyer
  this week, taking two cargoes of whites which, for an
  undisclosed shipment period, were reported priced around
  229/230 dlrs a tonne cost and freight, they added.
      Futures prices reacted upwards to the news of end-buyer
  physicals offtake, although much of the enquiry emerged
  recently when prices took an interim technical dip, traders
  said.
      Pakistan is lined up shortly to buy 100,000 tonnes of
  whites although traders said the tender, originally scheduled
  for tomorrow, might not take place until a week later.
      Egypt will be seeking 20,000 tonnes of May arrival white
  sugar next week, while Greece has called an internal EC tender
  for 40,000 tonnes of whites to be held in early April, for
  arrival in four equal parts in May, June, July and August.

  Caterpillar Inc, in remarks
  delivered at its annual meeting in San Francisco, reiterated
  its expectation of a loss in the first quarter.
      It said results would be hurt by a 25 mln dlr one-time

  company said it expected profit from operations for the full

      In remarks prepared for delivery to shareholders, President

training/1550,Economics,1,"GERMAN INSTITUTE SEES INFLATION RISING IN 1987
  The cost of living in West Germany will
  likely be about 0.5 pct higher on average in 1987 than in 1986,
  when the cost of living actually fell by an average 0.2 pct in
  the first recurrence of ""negative inflation"" since the 1950s, the
  HWWA economic research institute said.
      The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the
  fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986
  cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the
  value of the dollar, the institute said in a report.
      The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the
  course of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a
  whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the
  first part of 1987.
      Provisional inflation figures for February released last
  week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower
  than in February 1986. In January prices had fallen 0.8 pct
  against the same month a year earlier.
      The HWWA said its forecast assumed the dollar would remain
  around 1.80 marks and oil prices would range between 15 and 17
  dlrs per barrel.

  The Agriculture Ministry declined comment
  on a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks
  on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.
      ""We have no idea about the report and cannot comment,"" a
  spokesman told Reuters.
      Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources,
  said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
  and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its
  intentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for
  farm talks.
      The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue
  at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.
      Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff
  Control Act.
      Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries about
  mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan
  will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is
  justified, it said.
      The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay trade
  round last September. It will take four years to negotiate.

  Norway is expected to seek a compromise
  solution to defuse a row between Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap
  A/S &lt;STAT.OL> (Statoil) and Conoco Norge A/S over which firm
  will operate the Heidrun oil field, government sources said.
      The sources, who asked not to be named, said the government
  will likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as the
  field's operator through the development phase, with Statoil
  taking over only after production starts in the early 1990s.
      Oil Minister Arne Oeien told Reuters the government had
  today discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decision
  had been taken and several questions remained unresolved.
      It was unlikely the government would announce its decision
  on Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday's cabinet meeting
  and after discussing a proposed solution with both companies,
  the sources added.
      This spring Norway's state-owned oil company Statoil
  exercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration license
  that, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieve
  Conoco as Heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised by

training/1553,Economics,1,"FED DRAFTS CURRENCY, RATE SWAP RISK GAUGE
  The Federal Reserve Board voted
  unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of
  interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort
  to come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that
  takes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other
  assets.
      Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues
  today by the Bank of England.
      The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan.
      The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks
  associated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange
  contracts and similar financial instruments.
      Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines
  for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities
  that banks would be required to take into account in
  calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to
  maintain.
      Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans
  and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that
  would establish a bank's minimum capital needs.
      The additional guidelines proposed today would determine
  the amount of capital support required for a bank's current
  exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure.
      The current exposure would be measured by the
  mark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the
  replacement cost.
      Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be
  calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical
  analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking
  regulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of the
  asset.
      The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance
  conflicting needs for precision and simplicity.
      They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the
  particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts.
      Board officials said the new gauge could increase the
  capital required of the largest money center banks, which are
  the principal participants in these types of activities.
      They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the
  potential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to
  compete in world financial markets.
      However, the staff concluded, ""The credit risks inherent in
  such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk
  profiles of some banking organizations.""
      The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest
  participants in this market, on grounds the benefits of
  including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs.
      Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange
  contracts traded on organized exchanges.
      Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was
  not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital
  rules.

      ""We wish to see it (stability) continuing,"" he added.

      ""Interest rate stability is not an objective in that

  Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax
  reform will not affect his determination to reign in
  expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline
  in the budget deficit in the late 1980s.
      ""Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,""
  Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.
      Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs
  in the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he
  forecast in the February budget.
      And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was
  expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32
  billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.
      Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year
  higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income
  support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated
  revenues.
      But finance department documents show the pace of deficit
  reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and
  1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the
  transition to the reformed taxation system.
      The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in
  fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1
  billion dlrs in 1991.
      Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian
  economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct
  this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an
  actual 3.1 pct.

      In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in
  the statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April
  8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to
  increase the price of his offer.
      Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in
  place.
      Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> has now delivered
  to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing
  dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding
  Corp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition.
      He said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, which leads a
  syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr
  margin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for
  further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to
  an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the
  purchase of shares under the offer.
      Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,
  each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,
  or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into
  Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an
  independent investment baking firm.
      He said ""To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares
  are purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a
  combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value
  of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars.""
      Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to
  Caesars' recapitalization.
      Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming
  officials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory
  process required for regulatory approval, a process that it
  already underway in New Jersey.
      He said his offer has been extended based on the likely
  duration of the regulatory process.
      He said he intends to further extend the offer if the
  approval process is not completed by the expiration date.

  Ecuador will use a new pipeline link
  with Colombia to export crude oil for the next five years,
  Colombian mines and energy minister Guillermo Perry said.
      The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to
  allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5
  by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline,
      Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its
  OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts
  contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador
  mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said.
      The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after
  signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation
  of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling
  will begin in September.
      ""The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only
  for this emergency period but for the next five years, with
  possibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels
  per day (bpd) will be pumped along it,"" Perry said.
      Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels
  through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents
  per barrel during the first year.
      The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will
  run from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador's jungle
  oilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to the
  Pacific port of Tumaco.
      Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the
  Ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures for
  Colombia's 11 km segment but said it was ""insignificant compared
  with what we are going to earn.""
      OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd before

  The Soviets have not indicated an

  that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit

  Lyng told Reuters.
      In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did
  not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat
  subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.
      ""Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.
  There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that
  there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a
  wheat subsidy).""
      When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet
  summit, Lyng said, ""No, I don't think so. I don't think that.""
      The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to
  Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for
  discussion at a summit.
      ""It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the
  Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions
  about,"" Lyng said.

  agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was
  not something that would be discussed with the President of the
  United States. He said it's not presidential,"" Lyng said.
      Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major
  producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the
  still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final
  decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.
      The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement
  will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the
  Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the
  long-standing agreement.
      ""We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have
  failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would
  love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,
  but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.
  These are some of the questions we need to discuss.""

  Losses for Volkswagen AG
  &lt;VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will
  not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW
  spokesman said.
      The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it
  would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on
  1986 business, despite the provision.
      One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency
  dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from
  the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but
  the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an ""upper limit.""
      VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board
  meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in
  detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign
  currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing
  company.
      VW has said computer programs were erased and documents
  were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes
  transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign
  currency losses were not completed.
      VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was
  arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having
  evaded justice.
      Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985
  profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and
  parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend
  an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has
  also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,
  which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held
  dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.
      VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5

test/18991,Economics,1,"JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS WILL GROW AGAIN IN 1987, OECD
  Japan's trade surplus is likely to
  continue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroad
  increase while domestic demand remains sluggish, the
  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
  said.
      In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the
  OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last
  year, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while
  export markets rose by only two pct.
      But it said this differential between the growth of
  domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,
  ""thus weakening the international adjustment process.""
      It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two
  pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct
  in 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will
  rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in
  1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.
      The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion
  yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand
  and increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said the
  measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite
  possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have
  worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.
      The OECD outlook said, ""Continued large current account
  surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial
  net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure
  on the yen."" It said that further appreciation could then lead
  manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus
  weaken domestic growth.
      The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely to
  gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pct
  growth. But it said Japan would continue its good performance
  on inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a
  0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.

test/16268,Economics,1,"GERMAN INSTITUTES WARN ON MONEY SUPPLY
  Four of West Germany's five leading
  economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary
  growth threatened a resurgence of inflation.
      But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,
  echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said
  the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not
  necessarily threaten stability.
      The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which
  three -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in
  GNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.
      The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in
  view of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has
  shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price
  rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.
      Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may
  seem exaggerated, they said.
      ""But it has often turned out in the past that the price
  climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into
  a restrictive policy,"" they said.
      The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are
  less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.
      The four institutes disputed the view that monetary
  expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic
  investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market
  investments following lower interest rates.
      ""Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of
  central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a
  smaller expansion of money supply,"" they said.
      A return to growth and stability did not require
  spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with
  open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid
  an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.
      The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be
  focused simply on growth of production potential. Because of
  uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic
  weakness other factors should be taken into account.
      Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts
  and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation
  speculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat
  in itself to price stability.
      The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth
  reflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the
  falling mark.

training/10771,Markets,2,"JAPAN ISOLATED, YEN RISES, WORLD FEELS CHEATED
  Japan is becoming dangerously isolated
  again as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by
  Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth,
  officials and businessmen from around the world said.
      As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen,
  making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments
  grit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
  there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise.
      The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by
  both sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year.
      The document was prepared by a private committee formed by
  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of
  Japan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction
  due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must ""make a historical
  transformation in its traditional policies on economic
  management and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no further
  development for Japan without this transformation.""
      Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have
  looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the
  Japanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term
  prospects of totally transforming their economic habits.
      The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese
  prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to
  raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to
  the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral
  semiconductor pact.
      British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to
  block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese
  placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid
  by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic
  telecommunications joint venture.
      On Friday, European currency dealers said European central
  banks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might
  leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.
      Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group
  Keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory
  views last November when he visited the European Community.
  ""Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I
  found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe
  was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the
  results of the Maekawa report,"" he said.
      ""We explained that the process of restructuring the economy
  away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between
  domestic and external demand...Would take time,"" Saito said.
      Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial
  Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said ""I
  only know that your government, under the leadership of
  Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less
  outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa
  report which has attracted the most attention in Europe.""
      And Europeans and Americans want quick action. ""A far better
  answer than protectionism would be structural change within the
  Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And
  we hope to see changes occur in the near future,"" visiting
  Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.
      Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the
  fault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of
  change in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.
      Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business
  leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade
  problem.
      ""We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the
  Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,""
  said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.
      ""The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it
  is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their
  labour,"" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of
  Shearson Lehman Brothers.
      Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.
      Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as
  fast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled
  the country asking about this issue.
      He said People mentioned many things in line with the
  spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and
  steel industries.
      A major misunderstanding is that the private report was
  government policy. Europeans are confused about this,
  underlined by von Moltke's reference to the ""leadership"" of the
  Maekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last
  September's government programme of new economic measures.
  ""Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out
  that the government has put its signature to a programme
  designed to implement the report,"" the ambassador said.

      Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told

  Brazilian President Jose Sarney
  announced a move which temporarily legalises the purchase of

  imports of foreign goods.
      In a speech, Sarney justified his measure as a need to face
  ""current well known difficulties to obtain foreign loans for the
  purchase of goods.""
      The parallel market, although tolerated, is technically
  illegal. For the past year, the dollar in the parallel market
  is being sold at 25 to 100 pct above the official rate.
      Sarney's decision means that Brazilian importers of
  machinery and industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in
  the parallel market without having to wait for the issuing of
  an official order from the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade
  Department (Cacex).
      Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in an
  effort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviate
  the risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of the
  economy.
      The president authorised the National Foreign Trade Council
  (CONEX) to resume operating as the ruling body of Brazil's
  trade policy, with participation of the private sector.
      The Council had been closed three years ago by the military
  government of former President Joao Figueiredo.
      Tomorrow, Brazil was due to fulfill payment of 15 billion
  dollars in short range credit lines, but its economic officials
  have suggested a 60-day extension in the deadline in order to
  seek a renegotiation with its creditors.

  must to recover its annual trade balance surplus to the 12
  billion dollars average recorded in 1984 and 1985, and which
  dropped sharply last year to 8 billion dollars.
      He attributed the poor performance of Brazil's trade
  balance in 1986 to protectionist moves by industrialised
  countries, the fall in the prices of basic goods and the crisis
  faced by several of Brazil's Third World trade partners.

  and warships towards disputed waters in the Aegean Sea.
      Papandreou told an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens ""the
  military readiness of our country is able now to give a very
  hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out
  military actions.""
      He said the activities of the research vessel could be
  aimed at partitioning the Aegean.
      ""The air force, navy and army are in a state of alert,""
  General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General
  Staff, told a news conference.
      He said the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an
  unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters
  in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning.
      Ergenc told Reuters later that all leave had been cancelled
  for members of the armed forces in the Aegean coast area.
      The Turkish government said yesterday it had licensed the
  state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corp to explore for oil in
  international waters around three Greek islands off Turkey.
       Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes over areas
  of the Aegean and the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus.
      The latest row erupted when the Greek government said last
  month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium
  which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos
  and would drill in the same area after the takeover.
      Ergenc told the news conference the alert followed a
  government decision that Turkey should protect its interests
  ""because of measures Greece has been taking in the Aegean in
  violation of international agreements.""
      Asked how Turkey would react if Greece attacked any of the
  vessels, he said ""If there is an attack, it is clear what has to
  be done. An attack on a warship is a cause for war."" But he
  added ""We are not in a state of war. The measures taken by the
  military are directed towards protecting our rights.""
      Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rights
  in the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of the
  dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
      Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp told
  reporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditions
  Athens had attached.
      In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if the
  Turkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations ""we will
  hinder it, of course not with words, as it cannot be stopped
  with words.""
      Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert and
  navy ships had gone to the Aegean. But government spokesman
  Yannis Roubatis did not confirm the move, saying only ""The Greek
  fleet is not at its naval base.""
      Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pct
  of the areas proposed for research were on the Greek
  continental shelf.
      Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a part
  in orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece to
  negotiate with Turkey, the Greek government would not accept
  it.
      Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will not
  negotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights in
  the Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus.
      He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not be
  possible for Greece to discuss the future of American military
  bases here. Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Bases
  in Greece in the event of war, Papandreou replied ""Obviously,
  and perhaps even before the war.""

  France's growth rate is expected to

  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
      In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECD
  forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
  would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said the
  rate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly
  higher than in the first half of this year.
      The OECD said France's economic situation has deteriorated
  somewhat during the early months of 1987. 
      Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory
  adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation
  has reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to
  reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.
      The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand
  pick up in the second half of this year. But both data are
  likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.
      The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for

  The Indian Finance Ministry's
  announcement in Parliament yesterday, changing the nation's
  interest rate structure, will benefit industry and agriculture
  by providing loans at lower interest, bankers and brokers said.
      The changes, effective today, included reducing commercial
  bank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 17.5 pct
  by one percentage point.
      New rates, which affect both Indian and foreign banks, also
  include a one percentage point gain, to an annual 10 pct, on
  deposits of two years or more but less than five.
      Bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pct
  interest have been abolished.
      Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect the
  government's concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and help
  improve world competitiveness of Indian goods.
      There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank deposits
  by long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will create
  the flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equity
  shares or short-term bank deposits, they said.
      A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs due
  to lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market.
      Tata Steel, a trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange,
  opened today higher at 1,040 rupees against yesterday's closing

      A stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic now
  to buy convertible and non-convertible debentures because the

  The price of gold bullion and share
  prices of North American gold stocks are benefiting from
  continued weakness in the U.S. dollar, analysts said.
      ""There's been a tug of war between the (currency)
  speculators and the central banks over the U.S. dollar and it
  looks like the game has gone to the speculators,"" said John Ing
  at Maison Placements Canada Inc.
      The dollar remained close to post-World War II lows today
  against the Japanese yen despite buying by several central
  banks, including the Federal Reserve, dealers said.
      A drop in the dollar means uncertainty and gold is the
  traditional hedge against uncertainty, Ing noted.
      Another analyst, Richard Cohen at Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd,
  noted that ""a lot of foreign investors are holding U.S. dollars.
  If they see they are losing money, they move back into gold.""
      A dollar decline also has inflationary implications, Ing
  said, adding that Maison Placements sees inflation rising to a
  four pct annual rate from the current level of about three pct.
      Ing predicts gold will peak at 510 dlrs this year from its
  current level of about 416 dlrs per ounce. Cohen sees an
  average price of 425 dlrs, and another analyst, Michael
  Pickens, at Yorkton Securities, puts the average at 450 dlrs,
  with a possible spike above 500 dlrs.
      However, gold stocks in the U.S. and Canada have risen far
  faster in recent months than the price of the metal itself,
  causing concern among analysts that a correction lies somewhere
  in the future. But for now, all analysts say there is no sign
  the buying pressure is slowing down. ""The stocks have run an
  incredible way,"" Cohen said.
      On U.S. markets today, ASA Ltd &lt;ASA> rose 4-1/8 to 61-1/2,
  Campbell Red Lake Mines &lt;CRK> was up 1-3/8 and Newmont Gold
  &lt;NGC> increased 1-1/2 to 31-1/4.
      The Toronto Stock Exchange gold index today was up 268
  points at 8067.90. Hemlo Gold gained 1-1/4 at 26-3/4, LAC
  Minerals was up 1-5/8 at 41, Placer Development rose 1-1/4 at
  43-3/8 and Lacana Mining gained 1 at 18.
      Ing pointed out that the TSE gold index has gained 51 pct
  since December 31, 1986, while the price of bullion has
  increased six pct. ""Canadian golds have been the top performing
  index this year,"" he noted.
      In the U.S., there is ""too much money chasing too few
  stocks,"" Pickens said. And many investing institutions such as
  pension funds and insurance companies still have excess cash,
  he added.
      Cohen also noted that today's silver price break through
  six dlrs an ounce indicates small investors are entering the
  precious metals market and he expects the ratio between gold
  and silver prices to narrow.

      A common currency system or EMS-style ""grid"" would, in

  exchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at a
  very low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remain
  small. ""Capital markets in the Arab world are still in their

  A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome
  Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>
  may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door
  for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
      Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
  of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
  debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
  substantial payments to creditors will expire.
      Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders
  that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.
      Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
  public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
  negotiations.
      TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt
  restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
  Ltd said from Toronto.
      Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow
  creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
  to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
  cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
      ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
  even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
  Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""
  said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
  Calgary.
      TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome
  was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
  refinancing packages, Gobert said.
      The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome
  since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
  to agree to a restructuring, he added.
      ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
  any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said.
      Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
  TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
  the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other
  possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to
  us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
  reluctant to come forward,"" he said.
      Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal
  offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
  confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
      Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
  with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other
  unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and
  financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
  TransCanada's.
      Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price
  for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
      However, he said not enough financial details are known
  about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
  TransCanada's proposed offer.

  Italy's Foreign Trade Minister Mario
  Sarcinelli, commenting on speculation in the Italian press,
  said a sharp balance of payments deficit in May could not be
  attributed to recent moves liberalizing the purchase of foreign
  securities.
      Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month's
  overall 3,211 billion lire deficit, which compares with April's
  2,040 billion surplus, could be linked to a May 13 decree
  abolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreign
  securities purchases.
     ""The deficit can be better attributed to premature and

  rather than capital outflow to portfolio investment,"" Sarcinelli
  said in a statement.
      Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks by
  the Bank of Italy, which announced the deficit for May and said
  it had been partly caused by ""non-banking capital outflows.""

  of capital to foreign securities or investments outside our

  A reduction of the U.S. federal budget
  deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation's huge
  trade deficit, U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter said.
      Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
  Yeutter said ""Capital and trade flows are clearly
  inter-releated now.
      ""Unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get the
  trade deficit down.""
      He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between
  the two deficits.
      Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S.
  budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas
  investors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and, to a lesser
  extent, other U.S. securities as well.
      ""We'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr
  trade deficit in 1987, but there's still a long way to go,""
  Yeutter said.
      He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and
  focus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetary
  policies to foster economic growth, U.S. competitiveness and
  the establishment of a ""level playing field"" for trade.
      The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserve
  under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the
  trade situation by getting interest rates down.
      On the fiscal side, Yeutter said ""the budget deficit is
  still our biggest problem"" and there has not been enough
  progress toward reducing that deficit.
      In the international area, he said that ""our major trading
  partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth.""
  Commenting on Japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlr
  trade surplus with the United States, Yeutter said ""Japan is
  just not doing the job on the import side.""
      Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the
  dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of
  Economic Affairs Robert Ortner.
      In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored
  meeting, Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels
  was fairly priced against most European currencies, but that
  the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued.
      ""The market will determine the dollar's proper value in the
  end,"" Yeutter said. However, he added that, if the U.S. and
  other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S.
  trade deficit, ""the dollar will be the equalizer.""
      Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and
  any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation
  or trade restrictions poses real dangers.
      He said ""there's relatively little that Congress can do to
  legislate a solution to the trade problem.""
      Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by
  U.S. trading partners, Yeutter said.
      ""There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our
  trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade
  legislation,"" Yeutter said, adding that policy flexibility is
  essential in solving international trade problems.

  Premier Yu Kuo-Hua ordered financial
  officials to quicken the pace of relaxing foreign exchange
  controls and study the possibility of suspending the controls,
  a cabinet statement said.
      The statement quoted Yu as telling Finance Ministy and
  Central Bank officials the relaxation was needed to help reduce
  Taiwan's surging foreign exchange reserves, which reached a
  record 53 billion U.S. Dollars this month.
      Finance Minister Robert Chien told reporters his ministry
  and the Central Bank would work jointly on new measures to ease
  the controls, but he did not give details.
      Yu said the government could maintain the framework of the
  foreign exchange controls while finding ways to ease them. The
  controls would be used during emergency.
      Taiwan's reserves have resulted largely from its trade
  surplus, which hit 15.6 billion dlrs in 1986 and 10.6 billion
  in 1985. About 95 pct of the surplus was from Taiwan's trade
  with the United States, according to official figures.
      But he said that while easing the controls would help
  reduce the reserves, it would not do so substantially in a
  short time.
      Economists and bankers said the new decision resulted from
  growing pressure from the United States, Taiwan's largest
  trading partner, which buys almost half the island's exports.
      Lu Ming-Jen, economic professor at Soochow University, told
  Reuters: ""The decision came a little bit late. But it was better

  controls will not only help our trading partners, but also help

  This week's Bank of England resistance to
  strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in
  holding bank base rates at 11 pct.
      But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the
  Exchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the Paris
  Group of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling
  broadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources
  said.
      Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing
  trade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the
  Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day.
      Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19.
      A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted
  a substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is
  therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.
      Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe
  Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the
  trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. ""Even after this action
  over the last few weeks, sterling's only just within striking
  distance of that range,"" he said.
      Other analysts agree that the government probably has some
  broad target range around this area.
      However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the
  pound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of
  a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.
      ""If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they
  are, what's to stop it (going higher),"" said John Cox, executive
  director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London
  foreign exchange market.
      Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active
  selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of
  general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped
  keep it below 1.60 dlrs.
      The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and
  1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.
      But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling
  heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it
  holds around these levels.
      He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest
  rate boat. ""If rates don't come down, the market will say they
  ought to have come down and will sell sterling,"" he said.
      Most dealers agree there is a good deal of ""hot money"" being
  invested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight
  or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short
  notice.
      However, the authorities will hope that at least a
  proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.
      ""The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and
  have to jack them back up again,"" said Richard Jeffrey,
  economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.
      He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for
  sterling, at least in the near term.
      However, most analysts are still looking for a full point
  about March 17, Budget Day.
      The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the
  Budget, said Temperton.
      The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the
  run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current
  bullishness in the government bond and currency markets.
      ""Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.
  He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate
  cut,"" said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the
  equities arm of Mercury International Group.
      Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the
  way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in
  the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last
  Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.
      This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11
  3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest
  since base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.
      However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months
  money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut
  as a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates.

  Australia could lose valuable wheat
  markets through lack of availability if plantings for the
  coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian
  Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.
      ""If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove
  true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its
  valuable markets,"" he said in a statement.
      Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB
  spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that
  farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut
  back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.
      However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be
  cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were
  facing enormous financial pressures.
      He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln
  hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about
  16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting
  intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.
      If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in
  plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed
  with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling
  wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.
      ""Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat
  understand a decrease in production due to drought but they
  will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to
  decrease production,"" Condon said.
      ""If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export
  income earner, governments and government authorities will need
  to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing
  viability of the wheat industry,"" he added.
      Australia's leading wheat markets include China, Egypt,
  Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan.

  Top U.S. and European farm trade and
  government representatives called for a sweeping reform of
  world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply
  imbalance.
      Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here
  demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for
  an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and
  production.
      ""It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and
  harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the
  disruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls of
  protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation
  become more harmful,"" U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy
  Administrator William Bailey said.
      Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, which
  ends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to
  adjust its policies to the changing market environment.
      The need for urgent reforms is justified by the ""imbalance
  and tensions of the world economy,"" the secretary general of the
  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
  Jean-Claude Paye said.
      And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on
  Tariffs and Trade, he noted.
      Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint
  reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures
  to help farmers in unprofitable areas.
      Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm
  prices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, and
  instead help farmers through income support and adjustment
  aids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president of
  Cargill (USA), one of the world's largest cereal houses.
      Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West German
  Chancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must take
  greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices.
      However, ""differentiated policy treatment is required"" to
  take account of large disparities in the situation around the
  EC, he said.
      ""Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy
  and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the
  Community,"" he said.

  The U.S. Is willing to drop tariffs on
  Japanese electronic imports if Japan shows it will abide by an

  Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a TV interview.
      ""But there has to be a clear indication that they are
  willing to act,"" he said.
      Yeutter said difficulties in the Japanese economy caused by
  the U.S. Tariffs and the yen's rise against the dollar are
  problems ""they have brought on themselves.""
      The dollar fell to 40-year lows against the yen today.
      ""Certainly the movement of the yen is causing some economic
  turmoil in Japan,"" he said. ""My only response is that we have
  gone through about five years with the dollar going in just the
  opposite direction. Although I can sympathise, it's occurred
  for only a few weeks or months in Japan.""
      The tarriffs, announced on Friday by President Reagan, will

  Washington between Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
  will include ""some difficult items on the agenda.""
      Japan has failed to implement two parts of a three-part

      Japan has stopped dumping chips in the U.S. But it has

  OPEC output for the second half of 1987,
  including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln
  barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday,
  Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said.
      Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its
  ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters
  of 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter
  level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter
  target.
      Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, ""OPEC third
  quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while
  fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd""
      Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production
  levels would have on prices.
      Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,
  rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to
  adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln
  barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia
  and Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when
  a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about
  September.
      Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War
  enemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369
  mln in the second half.
      Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from
  the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has
  been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. ""We will
  not discuss it. There will not be any change,"" he said.
      Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended
  Saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems
  to be adressed. ""We are overdoing it in holding too short a
  meeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet,"" he said.
      Ali said the problem of price differentials between the
  prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly
  at the meeting.
  
      Ali said ""The problem of differentials is a real one. I
  would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem
  has not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced
  relative to heavy crudes.""
      Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the
  next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said
  ""If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do
  the work of another minister.""
      Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades.
      OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spread
  of 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes.

  News of a meeting between U.S. Treasury
  Secretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing the
  dollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said.
      News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in great
  secrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by
  Baker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fears
  that the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.
      The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over two
  pfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said.
      The announcement of the meeting, also attended by
  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneously
  in Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New York
  markets.
      Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies
  accepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministry
  spokesman in Bonn said.
      The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of
  1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.
      The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market
  reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest
  rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that
  West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.
      Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to
  coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with
  the surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating
  their economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget
  deficit.
      West German government sources said rising West German
  money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre
  pact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest
  rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising
  since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed
  raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.
      German yields have also risen over this period, but less
  markedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up
  short-term rates by changing the terms on its security
  repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the
  money market.
      The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,
  compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's
  inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,
  but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the
  Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary
  growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,
  bank economists said.
      This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the
  pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
  since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the
  more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.
      In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,
  the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this
  morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.
  anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.
      ""They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much
  under American fire,"" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at
  Swiss Bank Corp here.
      ""It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a
  significant retreat from its position,"" added Giles Keating,
  economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.
      The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of
  the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact
  on Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market
  economists said.
      Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank
  does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation
  rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,
  little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.
      The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication
  that the meeting would take place, although the Finance
  Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.
      Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to
  comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre
  accord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he
  assumed monetary cooperation would continue.
      The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West
  Germany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visit
  Denmark and Belgium.

  The United States may lift an

  Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986
  agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third
  country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.
      The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on
  Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and
  portable computers.
      Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after
  Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at
  below production costs.
      Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory
  and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.
      The Administration officials said Commerce Department 
  monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the
  semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking
  sales away from American-made semiconductors.
      They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would
  be lifted by the end of the month.
      The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the
  closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.
      U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance
  with the agreement earlier this week.
      The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining
  sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan is

  Flooding in the Red River on the
  Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a
  24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per
  day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a
  Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.
      ""The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any
  divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility
  that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week,"" a company
  source said.
      The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and
  one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.
      Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is
  restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring
  oil which has been lost to the flood.
      ""But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be
  difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like
  to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to.""
      The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield
  Corp &lt;ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell
  Group &lt;RD> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, which is the pipeline's
  operator.
       Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude
  oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to
  new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.
      July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to
  19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.
      Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of
  WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.
      Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline
  shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West
  Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a
  barrel below WTI, respectively.
      Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
  Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days
  but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River
  recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is
  dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area
  affecting the pipeline, Stevens said.
      He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was
  underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.
  The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil
  nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was
  apparently washed away.
     
      The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed
  at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this
  line.
      Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not
  found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma,
  which is nearby.

  The Kenyan economy is heading for
  difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must
  tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging
  too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said.
      In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said
  high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth
  of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985.
      The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of
  payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in
  1985, he added.
      ""But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a
  result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange
  reserves during the year,"" he said.
      The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreign
  exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a
  peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986.
      Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a
  barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs.
      Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline
  in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more
  difficult to finance the government's budget deficit.
      Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on
  servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of
  capital for the first time in its history, he added.
      ""This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult
  phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that
  we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign
  sources to finance our development,"" he said.
      ""It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on
  expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the
  lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more
  frugal in satisfying immediate needs,"" the president added.

  Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a

  with 50 billion in mid-February and 25.1 billion a year
  earlier, the central bank said.
      Bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the increase
  came mainly from the bank's purchases of more than one billion
  U.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and
  March 4.
      He said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, because
  Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade
  surplus to decline over the next few months as a result.
      Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise,
  but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion
  U.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987.

  on some 1,700 foreign products. It had been under growing U.S.

  OPEC has shown itself to be in control
  of the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a
  pact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day
  (bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said.
      They said market respect for the cartel has increased since
  it announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output
  to 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December.
      ""There are light oversupplies now, but OPEC ... Has ensured
  there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is in
  effect putting pressure on end-users,"" a European crude oil
  trader said.
      In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, ""There's no reason to expect
  a weak market from now on.""
      A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, ""We
  thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter
  production so the market will react very bullishly.""
      Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a
  slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmark
  crude, they expect price increases over the next few days.
      August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at
  around 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but still
  below the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.
      Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and Abu
  Dhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weak
  positions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traders
  said sellers might now aim for GSP's at least.
      They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices to
  stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.
      They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected
  and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter
  requirements before October.
      Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on
  European and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.
      ""There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production
  by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high,"" said an
  international trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was less
  bullish, ""For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on
  how much they (OPEC members) cheat.""
      A Singapore trade source said, ""There is enough cheating and
  leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is
  no need to worry about shortages.""
      Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level,
  after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearish
  factor to be considered.
      Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as
  possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market
  cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement.
      Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in

      The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for a

  semiconductors in world markets and to open its own market to

      The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimous

  Top executives with Tenneco Corp &lt;TGT>

  gradually increase over the next two years as U.S. reliance on
  imports of oil from the Middle East grows.
       ""I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to a
  trend of gradually increasing prices,"" C.W. Nance, president of
  Tenneco Oil Exploration and Production, told a meeting of the
  Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association.
       Nance predicted that by 1990, the Organization of
  Producing and Exporting Countries would be producing at the
  rate of 80 pct of capacity.
      The gain will come largely through increased imports to the
  United States, he said.
      ""They will be able to raise the price again but I do not
  think they will raise it as much as they did in 1979,"" Nance
  said. He did not say how much of a price hike he expected.
       Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predicted
  that world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20
  dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in
  1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climb
  from a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between
  1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988.
       ""Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in
  increased demand,"" Shoup said, referring to the gas industry's
  outlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal law
  prohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants
  and utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15
  pct, he said.
       Tenneco's Nance also said that some U.S. cities may
  experience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next
  winter because of the industry's reduced deliverability.
       Tenneco's gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20
  pct during 1986, he said.
       ""This does not mean the gas bubble is gone,"" Nance said.
  ""We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question is
  how broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or three
  years before we start to climb out?""

  improvement in oil prices was not enough for independent

  exploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by
  independents in the 1990s are pretty dismal,"" Walter said.
       He suggested that some independents may instead turn to
  exploration in shallow federal offshore leases. Farm-out
  agreements, cheap rig rates and less competition have held

  Mead Corp said the outlook for its

  augurs well for its earnings in 1987.
      ""The generally strong outlook bodes well for significantly
  improved earnings this year,"" Burnell Roberts, chairman and
  chief executive officer said.
      Earlier, the company reported first quarter earnings of
  34.2 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share, versus 20.3 mln dlrs, or
  65 cts a share, in last year's first quarter.
      In 1986 the company reported earnings from continuing
  operations of 109.3 mln dlrs, or 3.50 dlrs a share.
      Mead said its first quarter benefitted from stronger market
  conditions and improved operations.
      ""The combination of capital improvement programs and more
  employee involvement has been paying off throughout our paper
  operations,"" Roberts said.
      He added that Mead's pulp and paperboard businesses are
  operating well as prices have improved and strong demand has
  placed most products in a sold-out position through the middle

  Howard told Japan to resolve the row over the U.K. Firm Cable
  and Wireless Plc's &lt;CAWL.L> shareholding in a new Japanese
  telecommunications company or face an abrupt deterioration in
  trade relations.
      In meetings with both the foreign and telecommunications
  ministers Howard said he expressed deep concern about the way
  Tokyo had handled the dispute and about the continuing trade
  imbalance between the two countries.
      ""I put it to the (post and telecommunications) minister that
  I was sure he did not want to be responsible for an abrupt
  deterioration in the trading relations of our countries which
  would have widespread reverberations elsewhere in the world,""
  Howard told reporters.
      ""He listened very carefully and I have little doubt the
  message got home,"" he added.
      British frustration over the lopsided trade balance -
  nearly six billion dlrs in Japan's favour last year - has
  reached boiling point over the telecommunications issue, Howard
  said.
      Howard has accused Japan of trying to shut out Cable and
  Wireless from having a major role in the international
  telephone market in Japan.
      ""I want a fair crack of the whip for Cable and Wireless as I
  want a fair crack of the whip for Britain generally in trading
  relations,"" Howard said. ""We simply aren't prepared to continue
  to accept the imbalance which has been the position for such a
  long time.""
      Post and Telecommunications Ministry officials were unable
  to comment on Howard's meeting with their minister.
      But Foreign Ministry officials said Foreign Minister
  Tadashi Kuranari said that British exports to Japan are
  increasing, but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade.
      Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications
  dispute, including Cable and Wireless, to be satisfied.
      Howard told reporters that Britain was actively considering
  possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the
  telecommunications issue.
      ""There are measures which are under consideration if we
  continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations,""
  he added, but gave no details.
      He said he had received a reassuring response from the
  Japanese he has spoken with.
      ""But of course we've had reassuring signs from the Japanese
  for quite some time,"" he added. ""What I've made plain is we
  expect to see action.""
      Howard ruled out using powers in Britain's Financial
  Services bill to retaliate against unfair trade practices.
  Those powers, which allow London to ban foreign financial firms
  like banks from Britain, are designed to ensure U.K. Firms
  equal access to overseas financial markets.

  White House Budget chief James

  next year.
      ""Our greatest danger is overreaction,"" Miller told newspaper

  overreaction. I'm concerned about what I see in recent data
  showing a substantial fall in the money supply.""
      Edwin Dale, Miller's spokesman, said the remarks, published
  in the New York Times today, were accurate.
      Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact to
  signals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move he
  said could have ""political consequences.""
      The White House budget chief appeared to be referring to
  the effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidential
  and congressional elections next year.
      ""My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deep
  soup, and there is no question about it,"" he said.
      Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax
  revenues and a widening of the budget deficit.
      Miller's remarks reflected concern that the U.S. central
  bank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means of
  bolstering the dollar.
      Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve

  The Commerce Department said on that
  insurance and freight costs for imported goods of 1.45 billion

  billion dlrs reported on Tuesday.
      The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after
  the initial trade report to issue a second report on a ""customs
  value"" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance
  charges from the cost of imports.
      Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce
  Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion
  dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis.
      A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the
  foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers
  said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been
  revised downward.
      The Commerce department would like to have the law changed
  to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously.
      ""My feeling is the second one is a better report but there's
  legislation that requires us to delay it two days,"" said Robert
  Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.
      ""But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays
  any attention to the second figure.""
      The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a
  revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs.
      The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly

  customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison

  freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable
  light for the Reagan administration.

      Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks
  distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
  at The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bank
  for this free trade, open economy view is weak.""
      The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
  largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
  growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.
      The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
  and the subsidies are a waste of money.
      Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
  an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
  needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
  exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
  assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
      Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
  should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
  government would continue to maintain production targets for
  ""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.
      The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
  drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
  the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
  would save money by importing the commodity.
      However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
  to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
  industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
      He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the

  The inflow of long-term capital into
  West Germany slumped to 606 mln marks in February from
  January's record 11.91 billion, with foreign purchases of
  German bonds and shares declining sharply, the Bundesbank said.
      While foreigners bought only four billion marks worth of
  German bonds in February after 13 billion in January, they sold
  a net 500 mln marks in shares and promissory notes of public
  authorities after sales worth 300 mln in January.
      With German investors' purchases of foreign securities
  steady around 1.3 billion marks, only 2.2 billion marks were
  imported through securities transactions, after 11.2 billion.
      Direct investment abroad led to a capital outflow of 1.60
  billion marks in February after 2.83 billion in January.
      There was a deficit of 8.14 billion marks in the short-term
  capital account after a surplus of 194 mln in January.
      Banks alone exported some 8.6 billion marks in funds while
  domestic companies increased their short-term financial assets
  abroad by 700 mln. But public authorities received some one
  billion marks from abroad, the Bundesbank said in a statement.
      Combining long and short term capital outflows, West
  Germany recorded a net outflow of 7.53 billion marks in
  February against a net inflow of 11.91 billion in January.
      The Bundesbank confirmed the German trade surplus widened
  to 10.45 billion marks in February from January's 7.20 billion.
      Taking the two months together the seasonally adjusted
  surplus was slightly below the figure for the previous two. In
  terms of current as well as constant prices, the narrowing of
  the surplus was progressing, the bank said.
      Germany's current account surplus widened to 6.63 billion
  marks in February from 4.79 billion in January, but was down on
  the 7.26 billion figure for February 1986. Seasonally adjusted,
  the February current account surplus narrowed against January.
      While exports in February fell a half pct against the same
  month last year, imports fell 10-1/2 pct largely due to the
  drop in prices. Exports grew three pct in volume and imports
  two pct.
      In the balance of services, a fall in net investment income
  led to a 300 mln mark deficit in February after a 300 mln mark
  surplus in January.
      The deficit in transfer payments widened to 3.70 billion
  marks from 2.69 billion, largely due to a sharp jump to 2.3

training/1959,Economics,1,"GERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT
  The outlook for the West
  German economy is relatively bright, with gross national
  product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel
  University's Institute for World Economy said.
      The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading
  economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic
  than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently
  reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.
      In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export
  outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's
  strength against the dollar and other major currencies.
      ""The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in
  all, limited,"" the report said. ""On the contrary, a slight rise
  in exports can be expected.""
      The institute said past experience has shown West German
  exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by
  cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting
  their product ranges.
      They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in
  economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the
  decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow
  this year.
      West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed
  advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both
  of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary
  policy, the institute said.
      However, it said the labour market would see only a slight
  improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire
  additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by
  agreed reductions in working hours.
      The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of
  monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked
  acceleration of inflation.
      It also warned that what it called the worldwide
  synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new
  global recession. It said central banks in industrialized
  countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal
  Reserve Board's expansionary course.
      The institute said this in turn was bound to lead
  eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.
  Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks
  were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could
  aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as
  increase protectionism around the world.
      Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the
  negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary
  policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of
  growth at home.
      The institute said this could be done by ensuring that
  fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes
  should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and
  wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than
  in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary
  pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply
  to about four pct.

  Commodities from gold to grains to
  cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses
  in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of
  inflation and economic instability.
      Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New
  York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a
  troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.
      A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that
  inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations
  to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve
  Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,
  Harris Upham and Co., in New York.
      The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from
  the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their
  commitment to support its value, and despite reports of
  intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.
      Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known
  as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term
  direction of the currency markets.
      ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""If
  they do, it's not evident.""
      ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market
  take values to where they should be.
      ""One way or another, we will force our major trading
  partners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correct
  the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.
      ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long
  time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's
  going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's
  happening,"" he said.
      The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities
  cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.
      At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds
  saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning
  to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty
  McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of
  Dominick and Dominick.
      The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout
  the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton
  posted broad gains.
      Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the
  grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome
  supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate
  export demand.
      After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department
  raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by
  two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.
      Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the
  Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately
  higher.
      Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said
  hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at
  this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field
  work to market animals.

  Indonesia rejected World Bank
  recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
  the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
  billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
      Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks
  distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
  at The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bank
  for this free trade, open economy view is weak.""
      The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
  largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
  growth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming.
      The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
  and the subsidies are a waste of money.
      Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
  an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
  needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
  exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
  assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
      Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
  should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
  government would continue to maintain production targets for
  ""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.
      The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
  drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
  the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
  would save money by importing the commodity.
      However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
  to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
  industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
      He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the

  U.S. House and Senate budget
  negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached
  yesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending
  on agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.
      The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4
  billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.
      The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the
  farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a
  total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.
      The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture
  committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in
  agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets
  without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior
  Congressional aides told Reuters.
      Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find
  the budget savings.
      Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains
  subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat
  and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs
  and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.
      House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has
  said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.
      But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to
  be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and
  a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said
  freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major
  grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget
  savings Glickman claims.
      Another area where Glickman and other have said budget
  savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,
  ARP, levels for wheat and corn.
      However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand
  within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop
  wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30
  pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most
  commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.
      Congressional sources said the only way to achieve
  significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost
  the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said
  singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as
  unfair to one commodity.
      Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most
  likely to eventually look for budget savings are some
  tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible 
  adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.
      Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion
  but not enough, they said.
      Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture
  committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on
  all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price
  support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the
  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.
      This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau
  Federation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.

  reducing Seoul's trade surplus with Washington.

      The official said Chung is expected to outline Seoul's

  CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> has made a bold move in
  selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and
  ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share
  analysts said.
      ""It sounds like a good deal,"" Stuart McKibbin of &lt;A.C. Goode
  and Co> told Reuters.
      CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas
  interests held in the &lt;Delhi Australia Fund> and would instead
  sell it to Exxon Corp &lt;XON> unit &lt;Esso Exploration and
  Production Australia Inc> for 985 mln dlrs.
      In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largest
  sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it
  does not already hold in &lt;Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd>.
      ""This will be a big shock to the market, which was under the
  impression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi,""
  McKibbin said.
      A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and
  300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, CSR had given
  itself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on
  an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing
  divisions of sugar and building products, analysts said.
      CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the right
  to share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from an
  oil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years.
      Delhi is one of Australia's largest onshore oil producers
  yielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin.
  Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrs
  for every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs.
      Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker &lt;Bain and Co Ltd>
  said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industry
  was a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of
  Australian-owned assets to a foreign company.
      ""The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold
  back to the Americans,"" Goldston-Morris said.
      The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far the
  largest player in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry
  and would give it access to some of the best sugar properties
  and mills in the country, analysts said.
      They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend
  acceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from the
  bottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices.
      Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next
  season from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said.
      Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaging
  investment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the company's
  overall performance, analysts said.
      CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on
  what had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirely
  from U.S. Dollar debt, they said.
      ""It was a bad investment for them. They financed it entirely
  with debt, the currency collapsed on them and then the oil
  price collapsed on them,"" Owen Evans of Sydney broker &lt;Meares
  and Philips Ltd> said.
      Esso not only picked up Delhi's oil and gas output but also
  gained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses
  accumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions.
      Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stake
  in Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50
  Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd
  &lt;BRKN.S>.
      ""Esso has been very keen to diversify from the Gippsland
  Basin. They haven't found too much oil in Bass Strait lately
  and Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production,""

  China will not increase sugar imports
  substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints
  and large stocks, despite falling production and rising
  domestic demand, traders and the official press said.
      ""Despite rapid increases in domestic production over the
  last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to
  be extremely serious,"" the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986
  plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because
  farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical
  and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.
      The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop
  (November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year
  earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.
      The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500
  tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier
  figure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China
  News Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure.
      The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province
  fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the
  area under sugar was dropping.
      ""Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate,"" the newspaper
  said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of
  nearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane
  is a major problem.""
      A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian,
  south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in
  area planted.
      He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel
  developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the
  maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.
      The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province
  of Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667
  hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only
  70 from one mu of sugarbeet.
      The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to
  4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.
      Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed
  with each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in
  falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills.
      The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the
  official press has said.
      Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of
  sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.
      The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln
  tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.
      A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks
  in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import
  sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986
  when the central government resumed control of imports.
      ""As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored
  in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas,"" the diplomat
  said.
      The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to
  consumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly
  as coal had priority. ""How quickly they can move the sugar is
  one factor determining import levels,"" he said.
      Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba,
  China's major supplier through barter trade, he said.
      ""China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about
  152/153 dlrs a tonne,"" he added. ""China is not a desperate buyer
  now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into
  the open market.""
      A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regarding
  imports was price.
      ""While the foreign trade situation has improved this year,
  foreign exchange restraints persist,"" he said.
      The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five
  pct a year but ""a communist government is in a much better
  position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the
  foreign exchange situation demands it.""

  Uganda's Coffee Marketing Board (CMB)
  has stopped offering coffee on the international market because
  it is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.
      The board suspended offerings last week but because of its
  urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it
  could sustain, the sources added.
      Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been
  waiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has had
  trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the
  Kenyan port of Mombasa.
      Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by
  holding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings from
  coffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said.
      The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money
  and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty
  for such delays, it added.
      Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that
  commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings
  -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the
  current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100
  billion.
      The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of
  annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment.
      The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's export
  earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is
  likely to more than offset an expected increase in production.
      CMB officials have forecast that because the government has

  September 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.

training/10344,Markets,2,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - DUTCH EXCHANGE RATE POLICY
  Recent slackness on Dutch capital
  markets has led some bankers to question the Central Bank's
  policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German mark
  and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy.
      While agreeing with the Bank's commitment to defend the
  guilder strongly, some bankers want the Bank to make more use
  of the range within which the guilder and the mark can
  fluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System
  (EMS).
      Roelof Nelissen, chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV
  (Amro) said the Central Bank's policy was overcautious.
      ""I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely the
  range given to the guilder in the EMS,"" Nelissen said at the
  presentation of Amro's 1986 annual report last week.
      Within the EMS, the mark is allowed to fluctuate against
  the guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100.
      The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries to
  keep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. It regards a
  stable exchange rate as its main target, using interest rate
  policies to influence the exchange rate.
      The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate
  aims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands.
      Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short.
      Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: ""By
  maintaining the 113.00 limit, the Central Bank raises the
  expectation it will always intervene above that level. If it
  suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to
  obtain.""
      Amro's Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest
  rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of
  securities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital
  market. Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring
  about small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, he
  added.
      Unlike Amro, Algemene Bank Nederland NV (ABN) says this is
  a price the Dutch have to pay. It fully agrees with the Central
  Bank's policy, director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters,
  noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with
  the mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency.
      ""It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference
  between West Germany to maintain the exchange rate,"" he added.
      Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the
  Netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows
  between the two countries, as the economic performance of the
  two does not differ much, economists said.
      Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the
  Netherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 they
  accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two
  countries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the
  Dutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month.
      Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest
  and exchange rates.
      West Germany is the Netherlands' largest single trading
  partner, taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of
  imports in the last quarter of 1986, Central Bureau of
  Statistics figures show.
      At the moment, the rates for three month euromark deposits
  trade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a
  rate of around 5-7/16 pct.
      Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will
  even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in
  1987, contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany.
      In the Netherlands, the cost of living is expected to
  decrease by 1.5 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct, the Dutch
  Central Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month.
  German GNP is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflation
  between zero and 1.0 pct, according to most German forecasts.
      But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates, money
  dealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates
  independently without prior moves by the Bundesbank.
      Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22,
  the Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5
  pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit
  surcharge. Most traders were surprised by this move as they had
  expected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said.
      The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact
  on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted.
      While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its
  policies, the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range
  narrow.
      ""The European Monetary System is not only a relationship
  between the guilder and the mark. Many times widening of the
  margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell
  large amounts of a third currency,"" Central Bank vice-director
  Jan-Hendrik Du Marchie Sarvaas said.
      ""If we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper, the
  markets would start to believe it was weak. We don't want that.
  We want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as the
  mark,"" he said.

  Today's U.K. Economic data have pushed
  the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current
  nine pct further into the distance, analysts said.
      A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing
  production data showed that the economy is still strong and
  does not need a fillip from lower rates.
      News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,
  taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money
  supply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist
  arguments against easier credit, they said.
      ""The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back
  all the while. The strength of the economy and broad money
  growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near
  term,"" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.
      Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's
  mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies
  said were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.
  Rates.
      It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that
  a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such
  optimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise which
  mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling's
  strength.
      The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm
  about May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment
  rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly
  replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying
  average earnings in April, dealers said.
      The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending
  rose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank
  of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset
  the impact on domestic money supply of its current
  intervention.
      ""The gilt market reaction was correct,"" said Bill Martin,
  chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.
      ""That's very important ... It shows the economy in a very
  good state indeed,"" Skeoch said.
      ""There's no reason to get worries about inflationary
  pressures because they're very subdued."" Unit wage cost rises
  were better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to
  April, and it was these costs rather than average earnings
  which were potentially inflationary, he added.
      ""I don't think these average earnings numbers are a major
  problem,"" agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.
      But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried
  about the funding implications of recent intervention.
      He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets
  earlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that
  the ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, now
  looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try
  to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.
      However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson
  Securities, said any fresh sterling strength would still
  trigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signal
  higher inflation this year.
      ""Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As
  long as that continues we're okay,"" he added.

training/10779,Economics,1,"TOKYO BIDS TO STOP CHIP ROW BECOMING TRADE WAR
  Japan is seeking to prevent its computer
  chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale
  trade war, government officials said.
      ""We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have
  an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United
  States,"" a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
  official said.
       On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300
  mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's
  alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact.
      That agreement, reached last year after heated
  negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips
  in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.
      Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the
  fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime
  Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the
  end of April.
      While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure
  the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures
  it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure
  the trip's success, they said.
      ""The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,""
  one official told Reuters. ""We would very much like to do
  something to respond to that.""
      In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from
  spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the
  U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor
  makers, not to the government.
      Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an
  angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been
  forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor
  dispute, trade analysts said.
      They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest
  chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the
  draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact,
  included enforced production cuts.
      The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the
  announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties
  the government faces in taking further action.
      ""Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the
  U.S./Japan agreement,"" said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the
  Electronic Industries Association of Japan.
      He accused the U.S. of being ""irrational."" He said the U.S.
  action had made the bilateral chip pact ""meaningless.""
      Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute
  through consultations.
      Japan is expected to send a high-level official to
  Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to
  go ahead with the tariffs on April 17.
      Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry
  plans to step up purchases of U.S. chips and to propose a joint
  investigation into U.S. allegations of chip dumping.

training/10375,Economics,1,"INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP
  India is searching for non-communist
  countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
  conserve foreign exchange.
      Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and
  electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are
  all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,
  chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.
      Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in
  1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading
  Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).
      ""The two state trading corporations are free to use their
  buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
  exports,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that
  private firms are excluded from countertrading.
      One trade source said India has targetted countries that
  depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
  imports.
      However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part
  of India's total trading and are likely to account for less
  than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade
  during the nine months ended December, the sources said.
      Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65
  billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,
  against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.
      However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern
  Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.
      Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of
  agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude
  oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,
  against three billion in 1985/86.
      Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help
  narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still
  insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,
  Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.
      The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96
  billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion
  in the current fiscal year.
      But the push to include non-communist countries in
  countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow
  growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,
  shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.
      One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting
  countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made
  discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot
  officially support bartering.
      The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore
  exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.
      ""MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that
  preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind
  for goods and services sold to India,"" a trade official said,
  adding that the policy remains flexible.
      ""We also take into account other factors such as prices at
  which the goods and services are offered to India,"" the trade
  official said.
      Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign
  companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs
  and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance
  if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade
  sources said.
      Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean
  firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln
  dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.

  Military experts say the United States
  faces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of an
  Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a
  U.S.-flagged tanker.
      The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is
  likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as
  long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching
  limited retaliatory strikes.
      But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps
  -- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or
  destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.
      ""Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the
  cycle of attack and retaliation continues,"" said Fred Axelgard,
  a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and
  International Studies (CSIS).
      ""It's like a Greek tragedy,"" said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll
  of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)
  think tank.
      Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for
  Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to
  the war between Iran and Iraq.
      They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its
  30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began
  escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal 
  would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which
  President Reagan could never accept.
      U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon
  news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel
  fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam
  oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf
  time (0700 EDT) on Monday.
      Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military
  base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian
  Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea
  Isle City on Friday.
      Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and

  A free trade pact between the United
  States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides
  substantially, according to a study released by the Institute
  for International Economics.
      The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusion
  to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada's
  gross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S.
  export's by about seven pct.
      He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of
  government subsidies, end curbs on trade in services and
  investments and pave the way for new global talks under the 
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
      The United States and Canada - the world's two biggest
  trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150
  billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. They
  are aiming for a pact by next October.
      Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity of
  Maryland, said an agreement should include:
      - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phased
  in over a five to 10-year period;
      - Equal access to federal government procurement in the two
  countries, replacing current ""Buy America"" and ""Buy Canada""
  provisions with a ""Buy North America"" provision;
      - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly finance
  and transportation;
      - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor
  domestic producers;
      - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes.
       Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, the
  two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to
  2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties.
      The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct.
      He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset
  subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for
  resolution at an early stage.
      Wonnacott said ""bilateral free trade would contribute to the
  efficiency of the North American economies and to their
  competitiveness in facing overseas producers.
      He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadian
  goods and enable them to benefit from the economies of mass
  production.
      Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those to
  Canada proportionately, he said, because of the already large
  U.S. gross national product.
      Wonnacott said also that a U.S.-Canada pact in such areas
  as export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commission
  could set an example for the current attempt by GATT to write
  new and more liberal global trading regulations.

  New Zealand has imposed sanctions

      The sanctions will end all military cooperation and cut
  economic aid. New Zealand will also not renew an agreement
  which supports the price of Fijian sugar when it expires in
  March. The loss of aid and sugar supports will cost Fiji about
  10 mln dlrs a year.

  Leaks of a major Dutch official
  economic forecast due to be published on Monday indicate
  reduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment this
  year, political and market sources say.
      Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitiveness
  this year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wage
  increase, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered some
  calls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth.
      But whatever the government's response, the central bank
  will stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say.
      The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB)
  publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which will
  also see a key parliamentary debate on government finances and
  the economy.
      Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson - in an estimate
  reflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutch
  economic growth was now seen around one pct.
      Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset the
  decline in export growth caused by slowing growth in West
  Germany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar,
  Pierson said in its February economic outlook.
      The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pct
  growth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of
  2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September.
      The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and the
  government has already admitted it will not meet its goal of
  reducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990.
      Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central
  bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if
  necessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder.
      Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticised
  the guilder's revaluation in line with the West German mark in
  last January's European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and
  expressed concern over its effect on competitiveness.
      But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economy
  had become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of the
  dollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment.
      Some analysts also question the central bank's decision not
  to copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and instead
  lower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge.
      Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the move
  saying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on
  the money market, noting ""the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at the
  moment not the most important Dutch rate because it is already
  far below the market rates.""
      Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of
  the Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interest
  rate policies serve that goal.
      Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlands
  recently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being sold
  to take profits.
      Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark would
  reduce international confidence in the guilder and make it more
  dificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutch
  interest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revalued
  completely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment.
      Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decision
  not to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Pierson
  warned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder.
      Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministry
  and the central bank, with Finance Minister Onno Ruding having
  said before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lower
  Dutch rates but that the Germans should move first.
      One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates down
  to reduce the government debt burden.
      A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates were
  needed but denied any suggestion of conflicting views between
  the ministry and the central bank. ""The cabinet's policy is
  steady, the guilder has to stay with the mark,"" he said.

  Bangladesh's trade gap is expected to
  widen in fiscal 1987/88 beginning on July 1 after the
  government relaxed restrictions on some imports including
  luxury cars.
      The country has set its export target for the year at 1.1
  billion U.S. Dlrs against imports of 1.805 billion dlrs,
  compared with 1986/7's one billion dlrs of export earnings and
  1.113 billion dlrs of imports.
      Commerce Minister Mohammad Abdul Munim said the changes
  were aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boost
  foreign exchange earnings and imports of essential machinery
  and raw materials, to increase industrial production.
      The government was easing procedures to enhance incentives
  especially for exporters of textiles and frozen food and
  importers of industrial machinery and raw materials, Munim told
  reporters.
      Commerce Ministry officials told Reuters the import policy
  covered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billion
  dlrs. Imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by the
  government were not included in the policy, they added.
      They said the country's total import bill (both commercial
  and other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs in
  the new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87.
      The minister said ending restrictions on imports of cars
  and dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm the
  economy.
      Munim said Bangladesh feared a further drop in prices for
  its main export jute, ""which will certainly affect our export
  earnings"" in the coming year.
      Bangladesh's jute exports fell to 410 mln dlrs from 500 mln
  in 1986/87, according official figures.
      But Munim said exports of non-traditional items, which
  accounted for over 40 pct of total exports this year, would
  play a key role in achieving the 1987/88 export target.

  Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman
  Manuel Johnson said that maintaining price stability was
  critical to achieving non-inflationary economic growth in the

      ""It is worth reiterating that the Federal Reserve's
  promotion of price stability is critical to the successful
  implementation of virtually all of the important ingredients
  for growth,"" he told the Eastern Economic Association.
      Johnson said initial progress has been made on a variety of
  fronts. ""Federal Reserve monetary policy, the
  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation, the G-6 agreement, and the
  Baker debt initiative for example all have moved us in the
  right direction,"" he said. G-6 is comprised of U.S., Britain,
  France, Japan, West Germany and Canada.
      On the budget deficit, Johnson said meeting precise
  numerical goals was less important than a continuing commitment
  toward slowing the growth of federal spending.
      There was evidence deficits as a pct of Gross National
  Product were declining and would continue to drop, he said.
      But Johnson warned against reliance on inflow of foreign
  capital to finance investment and the budget deficit and keep
  interest rates stable.
      ""This situation, however, cannot continue indefinitely.
  Sooner or later progress must be made in controlling excessive
  federal spending,"" he said.
      A disinflationary monetary policy should continue to be the
  main objective of the Fed, Johnson said.
      He also said a more stable and sustainable alignment of
  exchange rates was needed for long-term growth.
      On the trade deficit, Johnson warned against ""quick fix""
  solutions, which he identified as excessive dollar depreciation
  or protectionist trade legislation.
      ""What is important is that we attempt to maintain healthy
  returns to capital and adopt policies encouraging genuine

  and ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for the
  future cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible,
  the Press Association reported.
      The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax
  Commissioners that any such provision was a capital
  expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible.
  The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an
  annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of
  abandoning a rig.
      An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the
  subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible
  from corporation tax payable.
      It would have been a bonus if the company had won but all
  budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he
  said.
      Oil analysts said that RTZ's assumption of liability was
  shared by the industry as a whole.
      The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the
  expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the
  expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were
  built into the accounts, one analyst added.

  West German Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countries
  would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on
  stabilizing foreign exchange rates.
      Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness
  of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and
  Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.
      But he declined to say what measures would be discussed
  ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later
  today.
      Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said
  the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre
  accord, had been underestimated.
      Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major
  countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual
  meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,
  marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major
  trading partners.
      ""There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord,"" he
  said. ""We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do
  not want to discuss that here.
      Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a
  ""slight firming"" of the yen against the dollar.
      And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged
  since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell
  marks to support the dollar.
      ""The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market,"" he
  said.
      Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the
  bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be
  accelerated as a way of stimulating growth.
      Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its
  pledges for economic stimulation.
      ""And we will have to see if the United States is able to do
  what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit --
  and get it through Congress,"" he added.
      Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further
  fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against
  the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis.
      ""You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And
  it is not just a German problem, it is a European problem,"" he
  said.

  The former chief currency
  dealer of Herstatt Bank, which collapsed in 1974 on foreign
  exchange speculation in West Germany's biggest banking crash,
  can stand trial for damages, a court ruled.
      The court overturned a claim by Danny Dattel that a case
  for damages should not be allowed after such a long interval.
      Herstatt creditors are seeking 12.5 mln marks from Dattel,
  whom they accuse of causing losses at the bank of over 500 mln
  marks by manipulating forward foreign exchange contracts.
      The crash of the private Herstatt bank with losses of over
  one billion marks stunned West Germany's business community,
  and led to a tightening of banking regulations.
      The losses were even greater than the 480 mln marks
  announced recently by Volkswagen as a result of fraud in
  currency transactions.
      Ivan Herstatt, managing director of the bank when it
  collapsed, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in
  1984 but appealed. Six other people associated with the bank
  were jailed in 1983.
      But Dattel was freed from prosecution after he produced
  medical evidence of paranoia caused by Nazi persecution during
  his childhood, which might have led him to take his own life.

  A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) &lt;SANM.MN>
  to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut
  Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources
  in the Philippine food and brewery company said.
      A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB
  from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC's
  outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on
  April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former
  chairman of both SMC and UCPB.
      Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)
  and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.
      Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and
  represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB's
  plans to sell the shares to SMC were ""a serious breach of
  fiduciary duties.""
      The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be
  held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities
  and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a
  government nominee on the company's board.
      De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,
  asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by
  the company's board.
      On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the
  sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per
  share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained
  earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the
  purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of
  dividends.
      De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate
  an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt
  to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon
  del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would
  boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.
      In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier
  suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres
  Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.
      De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming
  last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong
  subsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.
  The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board
  meeting.
      An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to
  resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by
  April 15.
      ""The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of
  a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard
  of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early
  disposition of the sequestered shares,"" San Miguel Corp said in
  a statement.
      ""Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have
  reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of
  payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the
  government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement
  of the controversy by April 15,"" the statement added.
      A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on
  Cojuangco's court petition, adding: ""Any statement coming from
  us might be interpreted as adversarial.""
      Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which
  sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible
  to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United
  States citizen.
      The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln ""A"" shares,
  which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln ""B"" shares which
  are available to foreign buyers.
      SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among
  prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by
  the &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed
  institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers
  in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.
      The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on
  Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were
  owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President
  Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the
  U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend
  announced last June.
      ""We have no objection to Soriano buying the ""B"" shares,"" Diaz
  told Reuters. ""But everything is on hold now.""
      The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy
  would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders'
  meeting, scheduled for May 14.
      San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion
  pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in
  1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of
  700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.

  The American Soybean Association (ASA)
  denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal
  under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and
  threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not
  remedy the situation.
      ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored
  Outlook 87 conference: ""It will be filed unless the EC takes
  drastic and immediate steps.""
      ""These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,
  since they were established after the zero soybean duty was
  established in 1962,"" he said.
      The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask
  for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to
  make the regime non-discriminatory.
      The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in
  an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production
  has risen dramatically since then.
      The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world
  market levels and is considering implementing a controversial
  oils and fats tax.
      The subsidies ""are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero
  duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,"" Adams
  said.
      The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its
  trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an
  EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the
  EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.
      U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in
  volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of
  EC policies, Adams added.
      Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at
  the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973
  when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.

  Prospects appear slim for a summer
  meeting between U.S. and Soviet officials before the two
  countries enter the final year of their bilateral grains
  agreement, Agriculture Department officials said.
      The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the
  agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up
  to last February. However, any delay this year should not
  endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends
  through September, 1988, USDA officials said.
      ""It will be difficult to pull together the people for the
  meeting during July,"" an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel
  Amstutz said.
      Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, the
  next talks could still be a ""couple more months,"" he said.
     
      There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA
  will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next
  marketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultations
  were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made.
      ""I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer
  or before the next agreement year begins,"" a USDA source said.

  year's crops, he said, ""There are too many variables now. It
  would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now.""
      Under the nonbinding pact, Moscow has agreed to purchase a
  minimum of nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain per year. Soviet and

  Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped
  to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to
  the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite
  continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts
  to extend world penetration.
      Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln
  guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.
      Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's
  leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,
  said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.
      The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,
  Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,
  where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.
      Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker
  foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.
      Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the
  increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El Aguila
  S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly
  in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The
  company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in
  restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.
      Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit
  next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had
  already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.
      Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the
  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer
  into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer
  market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. ""We
  have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important
  point,"" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken
  had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.
      ""The question is not if we want to penetrate the German
  market, but how we are to do it,"" van Schaik said, adding that
  while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a
  taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very
  regionalized.
       Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for
  African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most
  important beer growth markets in the long term.
       He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with
  majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was
  hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.
      Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters
  per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions
  and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total
  1986 sales.
      On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price
  of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists
  have been looking at other possibilities.
      To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on
  the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which
  had sold successfully, Coebergh said.
      Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw
  materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were
  popular in Rwanda . ""This is a possibility, but we could not
  possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,"" Coebergh said.
      Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to
  penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a
  contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.
      But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's
  market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that
  are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western
  money.

  The Federal Open Market Committee at
  its February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain the
  then-existing degree of reserve restraint, minutes showed.
      The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy
  directive which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than
  easier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct January
  through March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no
  M-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set a
  seven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March.
      The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds
  rate ""reference"" range for policy, as in other recent meetings.
      At a telephone conference on February 23, committee members
  discussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in
  Paris for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. No
  conclusions were contained in the minutes.
      In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC
  said that ""somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or
  slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable
  depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into
  account the strength of the business expansion, developments in
  foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and
  conditions in domestic and international credit markets.""
      The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged
  policy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president
  favored some tightening of reserve conditions.
      He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November
  through January and the firm federal funds rate that had
  prevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He
  also cited the recent declines in the dollar's value.
      Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential
  for a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed
  that prompt restraints might avert the need for more
  substantial tightening later.
      Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC
  minutes showed, ""the members generally felt that policy
  implementation should be especially alert to the potential need
  for some firming of reserve conditions.""
      In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve
  restraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in
  line with current expectations and there were concurrent
  indications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the
  background of stronger economic data.
      One indication of potential price pressure might be a
  further tendency for the dollar to weaken.
      The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer,
  preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing
  during the weeks ahead. However, ""most of the members did not
  want to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during
  the inter-meeting period, although they did not view the
  conditions for such a move as likely to emerge.""
      The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the
  dollar's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any
  significant effect on the Fed's economic projections. In
  addition, they anticipated that considerable progress would be
  made in reducing the federal budget deficit.

training/11746,Economics,1,"ANALYSTS SEE SLOW MOVE TO HIGHER U.S. PRIME RATE
  Quarter-point prime rate increases to
  7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will be
  followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of
  the Federal Reserve's policy intentions, economists said.
      ""Based on the spread between banks' cost of funds and the
  prime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, but
  no rush is likely,"" said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co.
      Citibank's surprise base rate increase, quickly followed by
  Chase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher.
      McCulley said that once the spread between three-month
  certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than
  1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a prime
  rate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently.
      However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until they
  see what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near
  term, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like to
  follow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example,
  the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks
  lifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discount
  rate increase in April of that year.
      Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since
  last August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pct
  shortly after the Fed's half-point discount rate cut to the
  current 5-1/2 pct level on August 20.
      ""The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. There
  should be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2
  pct rate and others 7-3/4 pct,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G.
  Lanston and Co.
      Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today's
  meeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed may
  well foster higher interest rates soon.
      Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policy
  change today, it may have decided to apply slight upward rate
  pressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heat
  up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery.
      ""The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to
  tighten policy when they did today's coupon pass,"" said Joseph
  Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co.
      In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, the
  Fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by
  offering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for
  its own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a ""pass.""
      ""The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy
  change,"" said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean Witter
  Reynolds Inc. 
      She said the spread between banks' cost of funds and the
  prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153
  basis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is not
  really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate
  increase.
      The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise
  ""may have been less a response to interest rates than an
  attempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line.""
      Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans to
  developing countries, large money center banks with heavy
  exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in
  an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans.
      The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money
  to one another could help determine how many banks match the
  higher prime rate and also how quickly they move.
      In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost of
  funds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federal
  funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly
  6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds.  
      The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting
  demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the
  close of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between five
  and 6-3/4 pct.
      Once the special distortions end, analysts said the funds
  rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the
  6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there,
  banks may not quickly boost their prime rates.
      But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many
  that the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to
  help the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly.

  U.S. retailers' lackluster March sales
  were due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect a
  recovery in April.
      ""Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, but
  underlying business is better than the numbers indicate,"" said
  Bear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.
       Analysts generally average the sales results of March and
  April to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. This
  year, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three
  weeks later than last year.
      Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said
  sales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a
  seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted
  5.7 pct last year.
      ""The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate
  that the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear
  to be because liquidity and employment are rising,"" said
  analyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.
      Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in
  according to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected
  to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.
       In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket
  items were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many
  analysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the
  holiday nears.
      ""Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a
  continuing strength in the housing market,"" said Edward
  Brennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported an
  overall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women's
  sportswear were also excellent.
      ""Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even
  a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment
  due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,""
  said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner. 
      J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH> were
  among the weaker performers with comparable stores sales
  declining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store and
  catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson's
  overall sales rose 4.8 pct.
      Penney chairman William Howell said, ""Sales continued
  strong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from
  very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed
  southwest.""
      ""Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity
  wear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,
  but are currently hurting sales,"" said Greenstein of Bear
  Stearns.
      Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for
  the decline. Edelman of Drexel said that ""Hudson had a tougher
  comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986.""
      Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower
  than last year.
      ""Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are
  being kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales
  are coming through anyway,"" said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.
      Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  
  be better than he had originally expected in the beginning of
  the year.

  U.S. moves to increase its warships in
  and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on
  unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a
  direct military clash with Iran, diplomats said.
      They said the American decision inevitably carries some
  risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt
  rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.
      ""As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the
  Gulf could do serious damage,"" said one western diplomat.
      Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks
  on ""soft targets"" such as merchant shipping not protected by
  American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.
      The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil
  tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated
  by diplomats as low. However, ""There is the threat that the
  Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,
  will go for softer targets,"" one diplomat said.
      Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar
  Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was
  ""moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.""
      The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10
  warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to
  patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.
      The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting
  Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered
  to fly the American flag to give them naval protection.
      Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by
  Iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.
      Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by
  Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is
  preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.
      The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to
  make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.
      A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a
  launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the
  Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.
      ""But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti
  territory would be a very serious escalation"" likely moving
  world opinion against Iran, remarked one.
      Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying
  out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.
      Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted
  last Friday ""a river of blood"" throughout the world in the event
  of any U.S. strike against Iran.
      Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused
  of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable
  capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.
      Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that
  most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to
  pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential
  trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.
      Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or
  other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.

  Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raise
  prime rates by half a percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following a
  one-quarter point prime rate increase by two major U.S. Banks
  yesterday, dealers said.
      They told Reuters local banks may decide on the increase at
  this weekend's routine meeting of the Hong Kong Association of
  Banks.
      G.C. Goh, chief dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank, said
  prime rate increases by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to
  7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 may prompt Hong Kong banks to follow suit.
      Goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6-1/2

      The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from five
  pct on February 28 after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 on

  U.S. And West German reaffirmation of
  support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental
  problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the
  current collapse in stock markets, London economists said.
      ""There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the
  dollar is going to be allowed to slip,"" said Richard Jeffrey of
  Hoare Govett. ""If not, there is going to be continued fear that
  when pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to
  tighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the
  U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.""
      But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which
  dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the
  very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation
  fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.
      ""If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street
  ...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,"" said
  Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from
  other London and Tokyo analysts.
      Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of
  further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary
  pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.
      Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the
  equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.
      ""It would be suicidal for any government in the context of
  what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their
  interest rates,"" he added.
      Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime
  lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed
  chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial
  system.
      The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock
  collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking
  crisis for example, thus precipitating recession.
      It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of
  1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said
  today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and
  that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in
  mind.
      ""The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.
  If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic
  growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a
  more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,"" said Capel's
  Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in
  danger.
      ""The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is
  disappearing from the equity markets,"" Dennis noted.
      David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world
  market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven
  (G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,
  as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies
  is still on.
      Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by
  expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money
  supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency
  stability.
      But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said
  Morrison. ""The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To

  Japan is expected to cut the base lending
  rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as
  part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris,
  Finance Ministry sources said.
      They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund
  Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3,
  abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with
  the bureau.
      The bureau channels funds to government financial
  institutions for public works and other official uses, they
  said.
      The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan
  Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance
  corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in
  tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.
      However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,
  to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund
  Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.
      The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a
  market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the
  domestic economy, they said.
      On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut
  their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28.
  The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors
  using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and
  Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of
  the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.
      These ministries are trying to determine which market rates
  should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate,
  the ministry sources said.
      Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1
  percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added.

  If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street,
  Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in a
  serious way, Japan investment managers say.
      The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollar
  securities, have already sold U.S. Equities.
      But ""if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happen
  yesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw
  significant funds from U.S. Shares,"" said Akira Kawakami, deputy
  manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd's
  international investment department.
      An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japanese
  investment in U.S. Bonds. ""Japan-U.S. Interest rate
  differentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothing
  in the absence of dollar stability,"" said Kawakami.
      U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture
  following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S.
  Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effect
  should be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise.
      But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiating
  to see if the dollar really is stable, he said. The dollar was
  holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning.
      ""Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in
  New York yesterday, most are still looking for chances to
  lighten their U.S. Stock inventories,"" Hiromitsu Sunada, manager
  of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment
  department said.
      Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points
  to 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914.
      ""Investment in U.S. Stocks and bonds is difficult,
  considering the dangers,"" said Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy general
  manager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed
  income securities marketing group.
      Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once
  markets have stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managers
  said. The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one
  or two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for.
  The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 6.3 pct yield for
  the 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said.

  bonds markets has not changed,"" said Norio Okutsu, assistant

  West German industrial production,
  seasonally adjusted, rose a provisional 3.2 pct in February
  after a downwards revised decline of 3.4 pct in January, the
  Economics Ministry said.
      The ministry had originally estimated that industrial
  production fell 3.0 pct in January.
      The February figure is likely to be revised upwards by just
  under one percentage point next month when the March figure is
  released, a ministry statement said.
      The industrial production index, base 1980, stood at a
  provisional 104.1 in February against 100.9 in January and
  104.5 in December. The ministry had previously put the January
  and December indices at 101.6 and 104.7 respectively.
      In February 1986 the output index had stood at 103.7,
  producing a year-on-year rise for February 1987 of 0.4 pct.
      The February rise in production was aided by a sharp 19 pct
  increase in construction output compared with January, when
  production in many industrial sectors was depressed by
  unusually severe winter weather.
      Manufacturing industry registered a 3-1/2 pct rise in
  production in February compared with January. But energy sector
  output fell nine pct and mining production declined seven pct.
      The ministry, which considers two-monthly comparisons to be
  a better guide to trends, said output in January and February
  together fell around two pct against November and December.
      The ministry said construction output fell 13-1/2 pct in
  January/February against November/December due to the cold
  January weather. Output in the energy sector rose four pct and
  mining output 10 pct.
      Manufacturing industry's production fell 1-1/2 pct in
  January/February compared with November/December.
      Within this sector, the output of both basic products and
  of food, tobacco and alcohol fell 1-1/2 pct. Production of
  capital goods fell 2-1/2 pct while output of consumer goods was
  unchanged.

  Weekend rain over the Western Corn Belt

  according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-Weather

      ""There is going to be more rain for the next two, three

      Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern
  Minnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in eastern
  Nebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.
      Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but
  were receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.
      Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with
  thudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.

  early-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage

test/16777,Economics,1,"JAPAN FARM REFORM A KEY TO TRIMMING TRADE SURPLUS
  Basic reform of Japan's protected farm
  sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to
  domestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its trade
  surplus, securities analysts said.
      The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and
  quotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and
  sheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they
  said.
      ""In economic terms, reform would be a plus,"" said Christopher
  Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co.
      The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices
  twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S.,
  The analysts said.
      Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the
  average household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross
  national product (GNP), according to a study by Chew.
      Reducing these prices could increase household spending
  power by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent on
  products which would have a more direct impact in boosting
  domestic growth, it added.
      ""There's a lot of slack,"" a U.S. Government official in Tokyo
  said. ""All that money could be spent on something else.""
      Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector
  amount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent
  estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37
  billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.
      Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm
  on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential
  development would also give a boost to domestic spending,
  economists said.
      ""Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the
  expansion of domestic demand,"" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor
  at Kyoto Gakuen University.
      Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform
  to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic
  restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the
  farm sector. Employers groups also want change. ""If you really
  want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to
  raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,"" Bumpei
  Otsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'
  Associations told a recent press conference.
      External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek
  removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade
  deficits with Japan.
      But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well
  entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.
      Although the full-time farm population is falling and there
  are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban
  constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on
  farm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several
  city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.
      The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform
  plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,
  the analysts said.
      Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the
  traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for
  national food security, they said.
      Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to
  import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms
  aimed at stepping up productivity, they said.
      Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific
  pressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew.

training/11224,Markets,2,"COMMODITY PACTS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MARKET
  Consuming countries, chastened by the
  collapse of International Tin Council (ITC) price support
  operations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before that
  commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are
  serving, a Reuter survey showed.
      They want price ranges to be more responsive to market
  trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the
  accords' support operations - and intervention rules that avoid
  the risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts.
  Consumers and producers, mindful of ITC buffer stock losses,
  have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations.
      Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a
  generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and
  prefer to assess each commodity case by case, the survey
  showed.
      The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) last week set
  precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager (BSM) could do
  under the new agreement. It imposed daily and weekly purchase
  limits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets
  and stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of
  total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. This
  will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, the
  world's fourth largest producer, undermining the market.
      The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer
  Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.
      A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) was
  adopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exporting
  countries agreed several changes to make the reference price
  more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions
  under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance
  operations. Direct cash contributions from members will fund
  buffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular feature
  of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running
  into hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue.
      Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiations
  in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that
  agreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said.
      Consumers and a small group of producers argued that
  ""objective criteria"" should be used to define export quota
  shares, which would have meant a reduction in the share of
  Brazil, the world's leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintain
  its previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and,
  although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today,
  delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term
  negotiations on export quota distribution as remote.
      International agreements exist for sugar and wheat. These
  do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for
  discussions on possible future economic agreements, collect
  statistics and draw up market analyses. Analysts said
  differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any
  progress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheer
  competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut
  militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat.
      An alternative focus for commodity discussions are
  international study groups, made up of governments with advice
  from industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber.
      The U.N. Common fund for commodities, with a planned
  directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed to
  become operational because neither the U.S. Nor the Soviet
  Union has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said the
  U.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives,
  citing the lack of widespread support.
      U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in
  Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity
  pact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing to
  study individual cases for economically sound, market-oriented
  commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.
      ""We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the
  price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,""
  official Administration policy states. The U.S. Currently
  belongs to only two international commodity agreements that
  have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement
  (ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat
  pacts.
      The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement
  because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and
  not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries,
  the State Department said. U.S. Officials singled out the INRA
  as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working.
      U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other members
  of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment
  mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect
  market trends and also to continue the accord as a market
  oriented agreement, U.S. Officials said.
      Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have
  consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on
  the merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister
  Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country, the
  world's top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides its
  participation in international commodity pacts case by case.
      Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing
  Countries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPC
  launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnes
  for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from
  70,000.
      Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and
  delegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told
  Reuters in London, ""Agreements with economic clauses to
  stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were
  close to market reality, if there was full participation by
  producers and consumers, and if participants were prepared to
  take their obligations in the framework of the agreement
  seriously.""
      But Baron added, ""No real sanctions are available for a
  country that doesn't stick to its obligations...The German
  approach is sceptical. We don't think agreements are the best
  instrument to help developing countries. They were never meant
  to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how
  developing countries often interpret them.""
      Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of
  commodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with Third
  World producing countries. But recently demands for more
  stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the
  need for ""intellectual honesty"" and ""objective criteria"" have
  grown.
      British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be
  a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.
      It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct
  market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree
  of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended
  borrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K.
  Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to
  reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather
  than dictate what prices should be.
      A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price
  realism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.
      A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable
  to commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer of
  sugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real
  market situation, particularly regarding stocks.
      Indonesia's Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told
  Reuters in Jakarta: ""These agreements can work as long as the
  problems are cyclical..But it's another matter when there are
  structural problems..But we are still committed to commodity
  agreements as an act of faith."" Nicaraguan External Trade
  Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers
  cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity
  agreements.
      ""The political will is not there on the part of some
  consumers to make agreements work,"" Martinez Cuenca said.
      The head of the economics department in the Brazilian
  Foreign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters an
  agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market
  reality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system
  of quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pact
  and actual market prices, it can work. UNCTAD spokesman Graham
  Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings
  enhance developing countries' ability to service debt and mean
  greater demand for industrialised nations' capital goods.

  between the two countries begin to fade.
      ""The Libyan bombing is a thing of the past, the trade war
  didn't happen and we have reached reasonably good cooperation
  on terrorism,"" one U.S. Official told Reuters.
      ""It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect,
  more harmonious than usual.""
      Since taking office a year ago, Chirac has been obliged to
  deal with a series of potentially serious disputes with the
  United States.
      During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets in
  Libya last April, France refused to allow British-based U.S.
  Planes to overfly its territory, forcing them to take a
  circuitous route. That angered Washington.
      The U.S. Officials, who asked not to be identified, said a
  year ago Washington felt the French were not taking strong
  enough action against terrorism. ""Now they are. We're pleased
  and they are pleased that we are pleased,"" one said.
      More recently, a dispute over U.S. Access to the grain
  markets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the European
  Community  threatened to become a trade war.
      In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberate
  Community moves to exclude U.S. Grain, the United States was
  poised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community food
  imports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute.
      Last week, the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad,
  supported, trained and armed by Paris and Washington, scored a
  major success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last bases
  in northern Chad.
      A French official added: ""There is also a common interest in
  getting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of the
  world by opening up its markets.""
      Although relations have improved markedly between the two
  countries, many irritants remain. At the top of the list is the
  Community's common agricultural policy (CAP).
      To Washington, as one official put it, ""CAP is the root of
  all evil"" in international food trade because it subsidises
  farmers and sells vast amounts of excess produce at below world
  prices, thereby eating into U.S. Markets.

  Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on
  world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains
  that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the
  Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said.
      December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before
  falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.
      ""Fundamentals are awful,"" said Philip Lambert, analyst with
  stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC
  production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln
  bpd, little changed from September levels.
      Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC
  production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and
  International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September
  production at 18.5 mln bpd.
      The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of
  a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea
  Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,
  in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag
  commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.
      The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the
  area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.
      Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on
  Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.
  Attack, analysts said.
      They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which
  around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in
  the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.
      Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in
  the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf
  hostilities, analysts said.
      But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian
  missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.
      Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,
  said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.
      ""The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond
  to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any
  further action will be met with a like-for-like response.
  Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,"" Pyne said.
      Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was ""a
  responsible retaliation,"" with the U.S. Apparently indicating to
  Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran
  chose to raise the level of conflict.
      Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.
      He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as
  Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests
  the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a
  result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian
  retaliation.
      The initial upward market move this morning reflected a
  strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which
  was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile
  launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.
      The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy
  attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary
  Caspar Weinburger.
      Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the

test/16565,Economics,1,"U.S. BANKS LIKELY TO LIFT PRIME RATES AGAIN SOON
  Major U.S. banks may lift prime
  lending rates again within days due to recent increases in
  their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is
  nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.
      In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most
  banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to
  7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own
  cost of money. That spread has narrowed again.
      ""A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,""
  said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.
      Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is
  justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and
  the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a
  percentage point.
      He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage
  points since last October until it fell below one point and
  triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.
      ""We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon
  as this week,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.
      ""We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the
  near future,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.
      ""Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding
  costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,""
  said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.
      However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime
  because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan
  demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain
  recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.
      Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift
  short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He
  said ""if there is widespread belief money market rates will
  stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.""
      Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a
  dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar
  fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders
  said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.
      In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to
  stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.
  interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.
      Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions
  on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said ""it has become
  clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure
  in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.""
      Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest
  rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation
  that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.
      That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the
  market than most economists had expected.
      On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small
  amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements
  with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another
  high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct
  today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr
  round of customer repurchase agreements.
      ""The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is
  offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,""
  said Jones of Lanston.
      ""The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the
  need to defend the dollar,"" Jones said. He believes it is
  merely shading policy toward restraint now, ""but to have a
  major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy
  overtly at some point.""
      Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by
  becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within
  four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.
      Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might
  well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to
  further aid the dollar.
      Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on
  30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate
  may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.
      ""The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening
  policy to defend the dollar,"" said Leslie of Discount Corp. He
  said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.
  Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures
  abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.

test/19285,Markets,2,"U.S. OIL PRICES STRONG AHEAD OF OPEC MEETING
  U.S. crude oil prices are at their
  highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC
  meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any
  policy changes from the session.
      They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the
  organization's accord in December, have risen on technical
  factors within the market and concerns about supplies because
  of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the
  Gulf.
      The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading
  around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile
  Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its
  highest level since January 1986.
      OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's
  oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to
  be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production
  agreement may only need a slight review.
      Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation
  of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to
  a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.
      Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon
  after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased
  tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices
  should begin easing.
      ""OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed
  to in December because oil prices are firm,"" said John Hill, a
  vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.
      OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at
  18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to
  16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln
  barrels in the fourth quarter.
      This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising
  from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.
      Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,
  Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a
  reduction in output.
      ""And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to
  trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that
  OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,"" said Nauman
  Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.
      But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such
  as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.
      ""The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the
  official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are
  committed to stabilizing the market,"" said Rosario Ilacqua,
  analyst with L.F. Rothschild.
      However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting
  in September to re-evaluate market conditions.
      Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the
  fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a
  day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000
  barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president
  of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.
      Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this
  meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to
  offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated
  throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,
  producers receive less money for their oil.
      ""The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,""
  said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.
      ""In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to
  produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act
  as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two
  dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,"" he
  said.
      One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.
      ""The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian
  Gulf,"" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache
  Securites.
      Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been
  regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration
  is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the
  U.S. flag, with naval escorts.
      ""Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis
  like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that
  could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,"" Knuettel said.

  Ministry on the country's economic development in 1986 showed
  gross domestic product (GDP) 2.7 pct higher in real terms than
  in 1985 but a rise in unemployment.
      GDP calculated at 1980 prices rose to 434,682 billion lire
  last year from 423,064 billion in 1985. On a current prices
  basis, GDP was up 11 pct, totalling 894,362 billion lire in
  1986 against 805,754 billion in 1985.
       But growth was insufficient to prevent a rise in
  unemployment to 11.1 pct last year from 10.3 pct in 1985, the

      The report said falling oil prices and the depreciation of

  OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6
  mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost
  spot prices and enable the group to raise its official
  reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current
  18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.
      ""Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the
  official price will be 20 dlrs in January,"" a Japanese refiner
  said.
      The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC
  members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and
  Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.
      Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as
  the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987
  output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs
  for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for
  U.K. Brent, traders said.
      They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into
  the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate
  (WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.
      ""With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import
  Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those
  grades further,"" said a Japanese oil trader.
      Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot
  market has further upward potential in the short term, having
  risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.
      ""You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that
  basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today,"" said
  one international oil trader in Tokyo.
      ""But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought
  back up again pretty quickly,"" he added.
      One oil industry analyst concurred, ""There is no reason to
  expect a weak market from now on."" He said he expected OPEC to
  raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.
      Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly
  in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and
  the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to
  maintain steady prices.
      Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day
  compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its
  export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline
  through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.
      Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,
  against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up
  to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.
      Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating
  on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price
  discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But
  they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as
  swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher
  output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise
  too high too fast.
      Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln
  barrels. ""Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the
  stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises
  too much,"" an oil industry analyst said.

  policy, central bank officials said.
      ""Today's CD buying operation was designed to seek an
  announcement effect, in which we would reassure the market of
  the fact that we have not changed our policy stance,"" a senior
  central bank official told Reuters.
      The bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-month
  commercial bills to smooth out tight credit conditions in the
  interbank market today, the officials said.
      The central bank was concerned about growing market
  expectations of higher interest rates, which were in part
  responsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices,
  the officials said.
      But money traders said the market generally shrugged off
  the bank's CD operation because it was small and at a rate far
  below prevailing market rates. The rate on the key three-month
  CDs in the primary market was 4.08/00 pct, while the bank's bid
  was 3.75 pct, they said.
      The bank's bill buying operation also had little impact
  because it was regarded as a routine operation, they said.
      The money traders said they regarded the central bank's CD
  buying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japan's
  pledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy.
      ""We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit grip
  any further,"" a bank manager said, adding that the prevailing
  market expectation of higher rates will remain.
      ""If this is the case, the three-month CD rate will stay
  above four pct for the time being,"" he said.

test/17930,Markets,2,"TAIWAN CURBS INFLOWS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE
  Taiwan's central bank announced that as
  from today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of local
  and foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached at
  the end of May.
      The central bank's statement added that the measure would
  be effective until the end of July.
      Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of
  foreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. They
  added that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge
  of the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend
  foreign exchange to importers and exporters.
      Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks
  reached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April,
  according to official statistics.
      Last week the central bank said that from today it would
  reduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40
  pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the move
  was needed because of ""distortions"" in the foreign exchange
  market.
      Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar,
  have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank
  market to avoid exchange rate losses.
      Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in May
  reached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9
  billion in April.
      All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be converted
  into local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming
  exports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in
  the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.
      In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions on
  remittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to
  Taiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money.
      Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of
  the local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs of
  speculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has
  flowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S..
      Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about
  22 pct against the U.S. Dollar.
      Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the
  foreign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on
  capital outflows. The central bank has said the controls will
  be dropped by the end of July or early August.
      Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement caused
  jitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavy
  purchases of U.S. Dollars. They said the central bank sold
  about 30 mln U.S. Dlrs.
      Taiwan's stock market plunged a record 75.53 points to
  close at 1,803.08.

  Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended his
  controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S.
  farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they
  approve of the proposal.
      The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per
  bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for
  soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on
  planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs
  for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.
      Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market
  sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting
  nations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the
  first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings
  examining farm programs.
      Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his
  ""Family Farm Act.""
      -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income
  and reduce government spending on agriculture.
      -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not
  ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would
  increase overall revenue from exports.
      This would be done by seeking agreement among major
  exporting countries including the European Community on market
  sharing at agreed high prices.
      Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing
  that such a grain export cartel is not workable.
      -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports
  would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices
  stem more from ""gouging"" by food processing companies than from
  high farm product prices.
      Harkin cited what he termed ""excessive"" net returns on
  equity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pct
  Monfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J.
  Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct
  Quaker Oats.
      -- Harkin said a ""legitimate"" concern about his bill would
  be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.
      He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would
  allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp.
  grain stocks for three years.
      Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a
  ""predictable and stable"" grain price, he said.
      -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm
  participation would be no more ""mandatory"" than the current
  farm program. He said farmers now must participate in farm
  programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect
  farm income.

  Figures for first quarter 1987 West
  German GNP will be published on June 11 after they were
  provisionally scheduled for June 4, an official at the Federal
  Statistics Office said.
      The official said there had been a delay in gathering
  information for the data, which are expected to show that the
  West German economy contracted in the period.
      A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said there
  was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on
  June 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends.
      ""There is no political motivation. It is a purely technical
  matter,"" he added.
      The West German government is expected to come under
  pressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partners
  to stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international
  trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.
      However, government officials have ruled out any further
  tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of
  stimulatory fiscal measures already underway.
      Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West German
  central bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, the
  widest measure of a country's economic activity, fell in real
  terms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first
  quarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.
       The government has confirmed that growth was negative in
  the first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected to
  be about two pct.
      Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank's reluctance to
  cut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate,
  at three pct, is just above historical lows.
      West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice
  summit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad,
  is already outstripping export performance, which has suffered
  from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over
  two years.
      The government has pointed out that depressed exports are
  the main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but
  says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will
  compensate for this setback.
      It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just under
  two pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.

  Brooklyn Union Gas Co, a New York gas
  utility, will see its gas costs up sharply as a result of
  Transco Energy Co's &lt;E> decision to close its pipelines to
  transport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said.
      Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in the
  United States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, or
  non-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spot
  supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,
  analysts said.
      Texas Eastern pipelines &lt;TET>, the other competing
  pipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the South
  closed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union has
  relied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.
       In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrs
  per mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gas
  costs four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said.
      Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open
  access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear
  of accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities.
      Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for
  gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers.
      Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount of
  supplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, a
  Brooklyn Union official said.
      Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said
  most of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed through
  to rate payers.
      While net effect on the company will not be known for
  several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,
  end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,
  will end up paying more for gas, he said.
      Because the closure takes place in summer months when gas
  demand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would be
  small, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson Lufkin
  Jenrette, said.
      If the situation persists into winter heating season, high
  cost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said.
      Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco for
  spot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co &lt;NCNG>,
  Piedmont Natural Gas Co &lt;PNY>, will face the same high cost
  factor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager with
  end users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokering
  firm, said.
      ""But these companies are not unwitting victims of the
  take-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers,"" he said.
      Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's request
  for an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facility
  for spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.
      Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas will
  threaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to
  alternative fuels, he said.
      In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the
  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is being
  negotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said.
      Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas
  for them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory
  on the inventory charge, he said.
      ""Cool heads will prevail,"" DLJ's Launer said, "" but it may
  take a while.""

  about a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freer
  competition, we have no choice but to accept it.""
      The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12.
      The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it
  should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. It
  should cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct of
  current capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput and
  gasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished.
      They said deregulation was vital to promote more
  competition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable.
      ""Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turn
  to see if we can survive cut-throat competition,"" said a source
  at one major Japanese oil company.
      A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, ""We'll have a hard
  time surviving, but that's something we must go through.""
      ""In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for
  the oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching out
  further into other lines such as real estate and travel
  agencies,"" he said.
      Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltd
  which had the largest share of refined products sales in the
  Japanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refining
  capacity in fiscal 1986.
      Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil products
  in 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, a
  spokesman for the company said.
      Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of the
  Council, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies
  within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the
  efficiency of the industry.
      Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to
  be streamlined further into five refining groups.
      ""MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups to
  merge into five to build up their muscles,"" a source said.
      A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out the
  possibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industry
  in the event of the relaxation of oil controls.
      He declined to officially confirm or deny that the
  Petroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures but
  said that in principal MITI would encourage a move towards
  deregulation.

  operating profits from the pipeline unit should improve from

  charge was incurred.
      Williams Pipeline Co took the charge against earnings in

  from service and for casualty losses. Companywide, Williams had
  a net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billion

      In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest Pipeline
  Corp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that are
  among the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07
  dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gas
  reserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feet

      The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which has

      The company's gas marketing business is expected to have

      Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs

      U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stop

  The 24 nations of the Organisation for

  growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into
  deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.
      The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD
  economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a
  2.8 pct growth forecast in December.
      It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the
  smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest
  hit by currency appreciation this year.
      The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth
  rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in
  December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.
      It said it expected the OECD to post a current account
  deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in
  large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.
      It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to
  fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in
  1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.
      It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr
  payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.
      The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50
  dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18
  dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes
  increasingly ragged.

  foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its
  trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last
  year's 18.4 pct drop.
      The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year
  and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break
  through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in
  1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.
      ""This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle
  of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather
  than a three-point landing,"" the EIU said.
      ""Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the
  February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and
  Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to
  more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter
  U.S. Fiscal policy,"" it said.
      It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the
  willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government
  assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.
      ""Thus far they have been willing,"" the EIC said, adding that
  if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would
  collapse.
      To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates
  would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt
  crisis, it said.
      On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look ""increasingly
  sick.""
      Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen
  slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to
  4.2 pct in 1988, it said.
      The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest
  single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a
  sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in
  December, the EIU said.
      On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West
  Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while
  Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.
  Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more
  competitively-priced dollar.
      It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and
  oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.
      However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over
  the current OECD average of three pct. Non-oil commodity prices
  will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first
  time since 1984, the EIU said.
      After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price of
  internationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in
  1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said.

  Recent government moves to curb capital
  inflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan's
  foreign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollar
  against the U.S. Currency, officials and bankers said.
      Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the
  reserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past two
  weeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against the
  U.S. Dollar.
      Chang said, ""The pace of increase in our reserves is much
  slower now than before and our currency is getting more stable.""
  He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surplus
  with the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S.
  Dlrs a month between January and May.
      The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and
  West Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs.
      On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings of
  local and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bank
  purchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90
  pct of the value of a contract.
      Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures had
  drastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange to
  importers and exporters.
      They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollar
  transactions showed a drastic decline with some banks
  registering a fall of up to 30 pct.
      Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised against
  the U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanese
  cents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of five
  to eight cents in May.
      The bank dealers said the central bank, which had
  previously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1
  billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercial
  demand.
      They said they expected the government to keep the local
  dollar stable in the near term to give breathing space to
  businesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise of
  more than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar since
  September 1985.
      The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today,
  unchanged from yesterday.
      Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said,
  ""It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflow
  is quite successful.""
      Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slower
  rise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure from
  Washington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan.
      Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayed
  imports of machinery and production equipment because of
  exchange rate uncertainty, he said. The stable exchange rate
  would help boost imports, particularly from the United States.

  The Philippines' first quarter growth
  figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely
  to achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor Jose
  Fernandez said in an interview.
      The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)
  announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct
  and gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter
  from a year earlier.
      ""I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it
  (growth) short,"" Fernandez said.
       NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the
  fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNP
  growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.
      ""Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources
  and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that
  domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and
  would not be a stumbling block,"" Fernandez said.
      ""I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at
  key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,
  showed that the economy was on a different track from last
  year,"" he said.
      Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the
  first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it
  could drop off in the third quarter.
      He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the
  manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in
  1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.
      ""That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,"" he said.
      He said the government had met all monetary targets set for
  the first quarter in consultation with the International
  Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth
  tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon.
      The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling
  58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988.
  Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or
  August to review performance in the January-June period.
      He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion
  dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs.
  Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their
  net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.
      ""It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA
  (official development assistance) accounts the commercial
  banking system will be requested to hold the line,"" he said.
      It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF
  debt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said.
      The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28
  billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March.
      Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984
  to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in
  April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in
  October last year, had almost been completed.
      He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level
  touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well.
  ""Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,"" he said.
      Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, ""I
  think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own
  receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap
  forward as might have been suitable.""
      The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach
  29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.
      NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first
  quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.
      Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of
  between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while
  growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.
      Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some
  economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the
  dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more
  competitive.
      ""By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso
  has already substantially devalued against all of the country's
  trading partners,"" he said.
      On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was
  opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted
  repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two
  years after the imposition of the Code.
      The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has
  been delayed by objections from some business groups.
      ""I think any central bank, certainly this one after the
  events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be
  prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds
  and I'm not about to do that,"" Fernandez said.
      ""It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of
  capital and earnings can be free,"" he said.
      ""We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainly
  we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external
  availabilities simply by servicing our debts.""

      It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht

      The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6

  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
  Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in
  Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection
  with their pact to stabilise currencies.
      Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why
  the participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawson
  replied, ""we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to.""
  When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float
  with set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said ""I do not
  want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as not
  to make it easy for"" speculation against the accord.
      Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual
  countries would take corrective action if their currency began
  reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors.
      But if such movements were due to extraneous factors,
  Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid
  through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges.
      ""It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having
  difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate
  appreciations and making their economies more domestically
  oriented, just as it is taking time for the United States to
  make its own economy more export oriented,"" Lawson said.
      In his oral evidence to Parliament's Select Treasury
  Committee, Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound's
  current level, adding that ""It is an objective ... To try to
  keep it around that level.""
      He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had
  changed since the steep drop in oil prices, largely because the
  pound had weathered that period so successfully. ""There has been
  a reassessment of sterling's fundamentals,"" Lawson said.  He
  disagreed with what he termed ""the grossly exaggerated claim""
  that real U.K. Interest rates were much higher than those of
  other major industrialsed countries.
      Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbank
  rate as quoted in London, Lawson said Britain now had a real
  interest rate level of 5.75 pct - the same as Japan did and
  only a 0.75 percentaage point above the Group of Five average.
      Lawson confirmed that ""over the medium and longer term, the
  government's objective is zero inflation.""
      He said the government's intention of its PSBR constant at
  1.0 pct of GDP ""is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget
  doctrine.""  He added that ""to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remain
  constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply
  a recipe for accelerating inflation.""

  compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might now

  remittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs

  For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is
  the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has
  played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for
  the last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the
  mark.
      President of the powerful and independent West German
  central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his
  contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the
  end of this year, government officials say.
      (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)
      But no official announcement has yet been made, raising
  eyebrows in West Germany's business community.
      The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top
  ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in
  opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.
      There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl
  would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own
  Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked
  closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.
      Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul
  Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international
  reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.
      Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook
  Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor
  Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was
  Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as
  Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.
      In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the
  dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of
  the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution
  which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent
  inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts
  of galloping inflation this century.
      But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and
  inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe
  to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the
  dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.
      ""I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the
  dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the
  Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark
  would endanger the economy in West Germany,"" he told business
  journalists in Frankfurt recently.
      Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that
  Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.
      ""Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not
  focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external
  economy,"" she said.
      An economist at a German bank, who declined to be
  identified, said ""If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will
  certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so
  rigidly oriented towards money supply.""
      One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to
  persuade the United States to stop ""talking down"" the dollar. For
  Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that
  the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise
  currencies.
      The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency
  dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in
  fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.
      ""This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they
  don't know - what the central banks can do,"" Poehl says of
  intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates
  round, making a speculator's position worthless.
      Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist
  in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.
      A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over
  a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.
      He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and
  play golf.
      Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute
  for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.
      ""But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount
  if you strike at the right moment,"" he said. Bundesbank dealers
  are very professional and skilled. ""They've burnt the fingers of
  many people,"" he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,
  the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.

      The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serve

      Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour by
  exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the
  exchange-trade currency option market against existing
  over-the-counter option trading during the local working day.
      Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become
  an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and
  had grown in popularity, he said.
      The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, including

      Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the

      He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Military
  action in the Gulf.
      But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian
  Petroleum Association, he said, ""If worst comes to worst and say
  the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely

  can take care of the situation.""
      ""But this is not to say that prices, at least for a short
  duration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of
  the situation,"" he declared.
      Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relatively
  short-term impact on prices, he added.
      Assessing future price trends, he said, ""Short-term spot
  prices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likely
  hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per
  barrel.
      ""The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greater
  than the downward ones.""
      ""The balance between supply and demand in the short term

  in world demand.""
      Subroto, a member of Opec's three-man quota committee which

  havoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize the
  situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers.

  Currency futures are likely to move
  higher following the sharp rally today after President Reagan
  announced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term as
  Federal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominated
  as his replacement, currency analysts said.
      Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,
  analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between
  now and the June 8 Venice economic summit.
      In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude to
  the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,
  analysts said.
      Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing
  a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks in
  Chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a
  technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,
  analysts said.
     
      ""Disappointment of European central bankers over the
  appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar
  lower,"" said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol
  Mackoff.
      ""The international community will not like this
  appointment,"" as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.
  budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and
  that Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to
  reduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David
  Horner.
       Furthermore, ""that Greenspan was not named two months ago
  suggests that he was not the Administration's first choice --
  and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,""
  Horner said.
      A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures
  prior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigated
  only by concrete action as opposed to ""jawboning"" at the G-7
  summit, he said.
      But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, may
  be at an impasse, analysts said.
      Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neither
  planned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from the
  U.S. to do so, Mackoff said.
      The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit
  as Japan and West Germany have urged, she said.
      Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut its
  budget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in the
  dollar could be forestalled, Horner said.
      However, ""the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing
  changes,"" Horner said.
      Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloane
  said European currencies will likely move to the higher end of
  their 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance.

  Mining group Boliden AB said it had
  agreed with Saudi state agency General Petroleum and Mineral
  Organisation (Petromin) to open a gold mine in Saudi Arabia to
  exploit one of the world's richest deposits of the metal.
      Boliden spokesman Goran Paulson told Reuters the Swedish
  group would  be responsible for the technical side of the
  operation and would have no control over the product itself.
      He said one option under discussion for refining the gold
  ore would be to ship it to Boliden's Ronnskar copper smelter in
  northern Sweden.
      Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it
  was strategically important since it increased Boliden's
  presence in Saudi Arabia.
      ""Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskar

  1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold
  smelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said.

  South Africa is expected to unveil
  tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year
  in a bid to boost the nation's flagging economic growth rate,
  economic analysts said.
      Faced with competing demands for increased military and
  police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black
  housing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is
  expected to raise significantly the government's overall
  expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament,
  the analysts said.
      Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state
  spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the
  financial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleas
  from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes.
      ""Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, but
  simply raising government spending and increasing the budget
  deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation,"" said Rob Lee,
  chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co.
      South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted
  growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of
  less than one pct.
      Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5
  pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to
  over 30 pct.
      Economists estimate that the government's spending target
  will rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted at
  around 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficit
  before borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of
  GDP.
      The government, having consistently overshot its own
  spending targets for more than a decade, also faces a
  credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the
  budget, analysts said.
      ""The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,""
  said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.
      Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less
  attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using
  their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the
  money and capital markets.
      South African Mutual's Lee believes government spending
  will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49
  billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5
  pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the
  IMF.
      ""The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,"" predicted
  one analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away
  from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past
  two years.
      The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the
  political situation and the onset of an economic crisis
  triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over
  loans to the country in September 1985.
      Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling
  per capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,
  government officials say economic growth is the prime
  objective.
      But private-sector economists caution that the government's
  ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is
  constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the
  current account of the country's balance of payments.
      Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5
  billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the
  nation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an
  arrangement reached earlier this year with major international
  creditor banks.
      Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has
  little room to manoeuvre.
      Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and
  budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and
  South African Transport Services suggest that major tax
  concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.
      Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions
  for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only
  election. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget.
      ""This will not be a very exciting budget,"" commented Harry
  Schwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive
  Federal Party. ""I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the
  sweets were given out before the election.""

  The Bundesbank should take further
  steps to reduce German interest rates to protect the mark from
  further appreciation and to persuade investors to bring
  long-term yields lower, Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> management
  board chairman Walter Seipp said.
      But he told the bank's annual news conference this did not
  mean a cut in leading interest rates, rather a reduction in
  money market rates through bringing the allocation rates down
  for Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements.
      ""Leading interest rates are not the decisive rates,"" he said.
  ""The money market rates are the important ones.""
      Seipp said the Bundesbank should move away from allocating
  money market liquidity at a fixed 3.8 pct as it has in recent
  tender allocations.
      An easier monetary policy would not mean a loss of
  credibility for the Bundesbank in its containment of monetary
  growth. A fall in short rates would make the public aware of
  the high yields in bonds and lead to a longer-term capital
  formation, braking the expansion of money supply.
      ""Thus, you can have lower rates and also a normalisation of
  monetary growth both at the same time,"" he added.
      Seipp said there were no grounds to paint too black a
  picture of the German economy, since company profitability had
  improved over recent years and domestic oriented firms were
  profiting from cheaper imports because of the rise in the mark.
      Growth this year should be at least one pct, he said,
  describing the downturn in production in the first months as a
  false start, unrepresentative of the rest of the year.
      After an economic contraction in the first quarter, the
  economy should show an uptrend in the last three. ""We don't
  believe that the economy has tipped over, but see it more as a
  'growth dip,'"" Seipp said.
      But Seipp also called for support for growth from fiscal
  policy, saying the top rate of income and corporate tax should
  be brought down to 49 pct. The current peak rate is 56 pct.
      The additional tax cuts brought forward to next January
  were no substitute for support for growth.
      Seipp added the federal government should make ""further
  courageous steps to decrease the state's proportion of the
  German economy and to increase its flexibility.""

      Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln

  lost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax.
      A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs
  from 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise was
  mainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in
  consumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.
      Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,
  Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or
  4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.
      Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
  medium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are not

  whole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.
      Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on
  non-accrual because the Quito government also suspended
  interest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interest
  income by 1.5 mln dlrs.
      Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs
  from 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from
  3.96 pct.
      This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, a

  of the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and
  a narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical's
  cost of funds.

  Storage problems with Brazil's record
  grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln

      Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,
  told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this
  year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.
      He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in
  harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage
  problems.
      Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,
  theoretically sufficient for the crop.
      But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly
  distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do
  Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were
  responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.
      The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West
  growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage
  capacity.
      Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and
  maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains
  production but only 20 pct of its storage space.
      In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,
  there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to
  storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for
  storing loose grain, Brito said.
      Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the
  crops.
      The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop
  has been evident from television reports, which have shown

  countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem
  between the United States and West Germany and insisted that
  the currency pact was still alive.

  comment will regret it later on.""
      French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the

      So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been
  taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted,
  only on an intermittent basis.
      They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week
  he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the
  limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000
  in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him.
      The traders recently returned from West Africa say
  producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so
  far, noting producing countries are part of the international
  cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers.
      London traders say terminal market prices would have to
  gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day average
  indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference
  price).
      However, little progress has been made in that direction,
  and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower
  intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously.
      The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be
  making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the
  agreement such action is not automatic, traders said.
      Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager
  are not confined to West African producers, they observed.
      A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources
  there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the
  intermittent buffer stock buying activities.
      In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than
  21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total
  potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes.
  Carryover holdings from the previous International Cocoa
  Agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes.
      Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from
  Friday's close, basis July at its high of 1,271.
      It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from
  the market, prices go up, while when he declares his intention
  to buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said.

  Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countries
  for emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by the
  country's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said.
      Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid
  needed for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts.
      The letter said the government had to step in ""to avert
  serious economic hardship"" and because the Social Services
  Ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision
  of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas.
      The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a six
  month period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice crop
  was harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour and
  other cereals were required, it said, along with supplies of
  sugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.
      In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha
  (October 1986-April 1987) crop had been ""almost completely
  devastated,"" the letter said. Maha paddy output was now
  estimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originally
  expected.
      There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a high
  forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate
  rainfall within the next three to four weeks.
      ""Should the present drought continue, however, production is
  estimated at around 20 mln bushels,"" the letter added.
      Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90
  and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Last
  year's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.
      The letter said villagers in most seriously affected
  districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because
  subsidiary crops had also failed.
      It said the government's current budget did not permit it
  to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected.
  ""Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity
  prices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continue
  to exert pressure on the expenditure side.""
      The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per
  month for each family, as well as handling, transport and
  distribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds by
  the government would not be possible without seriously
  impairing development projects, or ""greatly fuelling inflation""
  in the economy, the letter said.
      The letter said the Food Department would be able to
  release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the
  immediate cereal requirements ""provided such stocks are replaced
  subsequently.""
      The Meteorological Department said the country was
  experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month
  dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when
  the monsoon rains fell in late May.
      The letter said some areas had been experiencing the
  drought since August, and in the rice growing district of
  Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June
  1986.

  British Petroleum Co PLC may have to
  raise its planned 70 dlrs a share tender offer for the publicly

      ""There's a lot of speculation here that someway or other
  they would be forced to come up with another bid,"" said Rosario
  Ilaqua of L.F. Rothschild.
      And despite BP managing director David Simon's denial today
  that BP would raise the offer, the analysts said that remained
  a distinct possibility.
      Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal Dutch/Shell
  Group's &lt;RD> &lt;SC> bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell Oil
  Co in 1984 and 1985. Royal Dutch/Shell eventually raised its
  initial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share, after
  lawsuits by minority shareholders.
      ""I think they're going to have to go a little higher
  eventually, just as Royal Dutch/Shell had to go a little higher
  for the Shell Oil minority shares,"" Bruce Lazier of Prescott
  Ball and Turben said. He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share.
      Royal Dutch/Shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30.5 pct
  of Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984. After
  objections from minority shareholders about the price, Royal
  Dutch/Shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender
  offer in April 1984.
      But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the
  offer. After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil,
  Royal Dutch/Shell agreed to another two dlrs increase.
      It ended up paying 5.67 billion dlrs for the outstanding
  Shell Oil stake, a significant premium to its original bid of
  about 5.2 billion dlrs.
      The analysts made their comments before Simon's remarks at
  a BP press conference in New York this afternoon.
      Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told
  clients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible. The
  analyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share.
      Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the
  Royal Dutch/Shell group precedent. But there may be shareholder
  lawsuits for the same reason, they said.

  Steel stocks, which have had a healthy
  runup recently, still present some short term investment
  opportunities, according to some steel analysts.
      But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm
  prices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end
  soon. They recommend taking profits.
      ""It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal,"" said
  Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. ""Orders will be
  strong for about two months, and there are signs that some
  (order rates) are starting to dive already.""
      But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees
  some short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp
  &lt;X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>, Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Inland Steel
  Industries Inc &lt;IAD>.
      ""There is still some attractiveness to steels over the
  short- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and
  rising prices,"" Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,
  however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to
  make them more efficient.
      Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues to
  recommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.
      Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance
  sheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business
  has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford
  noted. ""It's not a high-quality investment situation yet but
  they've come a long way,"" he said.
      ""We think the stock will do moderately better than the
  market,"" he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,
  could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.
      Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,
  before special gains from recouped investment tax credits,
  against losses last year.
      Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he
  said.
      Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. ""We had a buy
  on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have
  it,"" he said.
      The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a
  share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and
  from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. ""But a lot
  depends on oil prices,"" he added. About 60 pct of USX's sales
  come from oil and natural gas.
      Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of
  Salomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. ""The company's done a lot
  (of restructuring), more than the market's given them credit
  for,"" she said.
      She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was
  trading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a
  share this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in
  1986.
      Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has
  been recommending the stocks since last November.
      Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group
  although he said the earnings outlook is improved through the
  third quarter.
      But he sees potential trouble beyond then. ""I think (steel)
  prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,""
  he said.
      Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal
  dropoff later in the year. ""But there are more positives than
  negatives,"" she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic
  industry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should
  cause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.

      A senior bank official, who declined to be named, told

      ""The surge in reserves is the result of our trade surplus

  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard

  United States opposes key parts of the proposal.
      ""We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal.
  It will help us in getting the negotiations underway,"" Lyng
  told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.
      Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg
  endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission.
  The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay
  round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.
      Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan
  seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing
  curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.
      The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all
  farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has
  pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching
  a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.
      However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the
  Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is
  unrealistic.
      Asked about such criticism, Lyng said ""The alternative to
  doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I
  think that is the unrealistic position.""
      ""I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are
  trying to say.""
      Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a

  started.
      ""All that some countries would like to have would be a
  wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat.
  That doesn't do a thing for us,"" Lyng said.
      The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of
  agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he
  said.

  over unfair Japanese trade practices in semiconductor trade,
  but ""I am sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out.""
      Sanctions are to be imposed on April 17.

  with Japan, because Japan had too much value in exports to the
  United States to risk such a war.
      ""Those fears are unfounded,"" he said.
      He told reporters later that the sharp drop in the
  securities market was not due to fears of a trade war, but fear
  of inflation and that the Federal Reserve may act on that fact.
      Market reaction was also due, he said, to the drop in the
  value of the dollar, although trade issues did have some
  effect.

  in the market to trade sanctions were ""barking up the wrong

  Tenneco Inc said Tennessee Gas Pipeline
  Co, its largest interstate natural gas pipeline, will transport
  natural gas under the open access rules of the Federal Energy
  Regulatory Commission, FERC.
      In open access, gas pipelines serve purely as a transport
  company, moving gas from suppliers to customers. Pipelines also
  transport its own gas to customers.
      Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co &lt;T> rejected the FERC
  guidelines, saying it would not offer open access until the
  regulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces for
  gas it has bought but could not sell.
      The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or pay
  contracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-term
  contracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe as
  customers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access.
      Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that
  Tenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines to
  open-access because of the take-or-pay issue.
      But Tenneco today said open access ""is one of the steps
  FERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERC
  is moving the industry through this restructuring now, even

  Britain had a visible trade deficit of
  2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised
  deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official
  statistics show.
      Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central
  Statistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in
  deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third
  quarter shortfall of 930 mln.
      For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3
  billion stg, sharply up from 1985's 2.2. Billion shortfall and
  a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984.
      Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the
  fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an
  estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. The fourth quarter
  figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday.
      The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to
  1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion.
      In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg.
      The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter
  was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and
  a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSO
  said.
      However, 1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg
  lower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil trade
  increased by 2.1 billion.
      The figures were broadly in line with market expectations.

  In a bid to hasten Japan's promise
  to speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreign
  trade, top U.S. officials appear once again to have signaled
  their tolerance of a lower dollar.
      Treasury Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides,
  Assistant Secretary David Mulford, said last week there was no
  target for the dollar, a statement that sent the yen soaring
  against the dollar, despite massive central bank intervention.
      ""That was no slip of the tongue,"" said one western monetary
  official, who asked not to be identified.
      For now, the strategy appears to be working. Japanese
  officials said late last week a package to bolster domestic
  demand will be ready in early April. Until last week, there
  were few indications the package would be ready anytime soon.
      The Reagan administration, facing an uproar in Congress
  over the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 169.8 billion
  dlr trade deficit, is learning now that to extract results from
  Japan, dramatic action is required.
      Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs on
  certain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhere
  to a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries.
      The shift in U.S. strategy, in part designed to appease
  mounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies, comes just
  two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review
  the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies.
      And news that Japan earned a record 18 billion dlr trade
  surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the
  need for urgent action, in the view of U.S. officials.
      Nonetheless, U.S. officials see signs of improvement in the
  deficit. ""I'd be stunned if we were not going to derive some
  benefits (from the lower dollar) soon,"" said one.
      In Paris, leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate
  closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting
  ""underlying economic fundamentals"" or economic reality.
      The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japan
  and West Germany stimulating their economies and the United
  States cutting its budget deficit.
      The three nations, joined by France, Britain and Canada,
  agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade
  imbalances.
      But analysts say markets have signalled the underlying
  fundamentals imply a lower dollar, rather than a stable one.
      Markets, in effect, are less confident than governments
  that these measures -- including U.S. budget deficit cuts
  agreed by Congress and the White House --will be carried out.
      Nonetheless, the dollar's sharp fall has not undermined 
  cooperation. A U.S. economic policymaker said the accord was on
  track and Tokyo and Bonn seem ""to want more stimulative measures
  which is what the Paris accord calls for.""
      International monetary sources said exchange market
  developments generally have not unsettled policymakers,
  although Japan is an obvious exception. ""Everybody feels it can
  still be managed,"" one source said of market developments.
      But last week, the Bank of Japan spent an estimated five
  billion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen, and other
  central banks about one billion dlrs.
      Another monetary source said Japan was upset with America's
  half-hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar, flouting the
  Paris accord outright.
      The source, close to the top levels of Japanese economic
  policymaking, said Japan's understanding of the accord was that
  the yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar, the level it
  stood at when the accord was struck.
      The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washington's
  use of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies. It was a
  ""pointed reminder"" to Japan to do something about the trade
  issues, the source said of the dollar's fall against the yen.
      By departing last Sunday from the language of the Paris
  accord -- that nations agreed to foster currency stability
  around current levels -- Baker triggered a run on the dollar.
      Later in the week, Mulford too said there was no target for
  the dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up to
  their international responsibilities and stimulate growth.
      But U.S. officials said recent market developments will not
  unravel the spirit of the Paris agreement.
      ""There's a realisation now that you cannot leave things
  alone, everyone agrees that the external (trade) imbalances
  ought to be adjusted,"" one official said.
      ""While no-one is going to cede national sovereignty, we
  certainly seem to be moving towards much closer co-operation,""
  another U.S. official said.
      The officials said the meeting here, where the six will be
  joined by Italy, will be a status report.
      ""Japan will have to explain what the state of their program
  is and Germany will report on its plans. Maybe there's a need
  to move faster,"" one source said.
      Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called, in
  effect, for currency stability for several months. This would
  buy time for Japan and West Germany to speed up their economic
  growth and help bring down the U.S. trade deficit.
      His comments appeared to serve notice on other major
  nations that Washington cannot wait too long for action to
  reduce the gap between the Japanese and German trade surpluses
  and the U.S. trade deficit.

  Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
  Lawson's remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise
  exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling,
  dashing hopes for an early cut in U.K. Base rates, analysts
  said.
      But the market's reaction, testing exchange rate levels
  indicated by Lawson, was probably overdone and the longer term
  outlook for sterling remained bullish, they agreed.
      In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy,
  Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting he
  was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current
  levels, specifying rates of around 1.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs.
      Lawson added the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling
  at about present levels, using currency intervention and
  interest rates to achieve this.
      The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five and
  Canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to
  include target ranges, but all participants to the meeting had
  so far refused to specify these.
      Markets were quick to react to the statement, chopping
  about one U.S. Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match
  the levels mentioned by Lawson.
      But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawson's
  statement signalled a change in U.K. Policy.
      Keith Skeoch, chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel
  and Co, said, ""the remarks have been blown out of proportion.
  Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue.""
      Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said, ""there is
  nothing great and fantastic in the Chancellor's statement.""
      He said he did not believe the rates indicated by the
  Chancellor were precise targets, but merely represented central
  rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate,
  perhaps by as much as 10 pct.
      ""It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an
  election ... I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie
  himself to a fixed rate,"" Brett said.
      Currency markets were keen for official statements to
  clarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency
  trading. This mood easily led to over-reaction, analysts said.
      ""Making similar statements when the market is high strung
  and ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake,"" one senior dealer
  with a U.S. Bank said.
      Capel's Skeoch said, ""it gives the foreign exchange markets
  something to shoot at.""
      ""It is obvious that the government, as a member of the Group
  of Six, has agreed exchange rate bands. But they are not cut in
  stone, they can change with time,"" Skeoch said.
      Brett said, ""we think the 2.90 marks level is a central
  rate. Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine.""
      Not all analysts played down the significance of the
  remarks, however. Chris Dunn, economist at Royal Bank of
  Canada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate
  sterling from the fortunes of the dollar.
      Although about two-thirds of Britain's trade is conducted
  with European countries, sterling has traditionally shadowed
  the dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted.
      ""Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the U.S. Or
  throw in its lot with Europe,"" Dunn said.
      ""It suggests that while the U.K. Is not actually applying to
  join the European Monetary System, it is seeking protection by
  shadowing it ... The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants
  the U.K. To clarify its position relative to the mark,"" he said.
      Analysts said sterling's dip on currency markets following
  Lawson's remarks made an early half-point cut in U.K. Base
  rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term.
      ""Over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get some
  extremely good economic indicators,"" Capel's Skeoch said.
      Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March,
  the last after the March 17 budget presentation, and analysts
  had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards.

  President Reagan said he would discuss
  the Mideast Gulf situation with allied leaders at next week's

      In a speech prepared for delivery as the United States made
  plans to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attack,
  Reagan said the American people were aware that ""it is not our
  interests alone that are being protected.""
      Saying that allied dependence on gulf oil was no secret,
  Reagan declared, ""During the upcoming summit in Venice, we will
  be discussing the common security interests shared by the
  western democracies in the MIDEAST Gulf.
      ""The future belongs to the brave. Free men should not cower
  before such challenges, and they should not expect to stand
  alone.""
      Reagan will meet the leaders of Britain, France, West
  Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan at the economic summit, which
  will take place in Venice June 8-10.
     
      The 13th annual top-level meeting of the major industrial
  democracies will take place against a backdrop of rising
  congressional concern over Reagan's plan to protect gulf
  shipping and demands that the allies do more.
       These concerns were heightened by the May 17 Iraqi missile
  attack on the U.S. frigate Stark which killed 37 seamen.
      ""They died while guarding a chokepoint of freedom, deterring
  aggression and reaffirming America's willingness to protect its
  vital interests,"" Reagan said.
     
      In a pre-summit speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of
  the Marshall Plan, Reagan, who spoke to an audience of foreign
  affairs experts, also pledged to push for economic expansion by
  West Germany and Japan to bolster the world trading system.
      ""While the vibrancy of the U.S. economy has contributed
  enormously to the world expansion, preserving a growing world
  economy is the business of every member of the world trading
  community,"" he said.
     
      ""It will be made clear, especially to our friends in Japan
  and the Federal Republic of Germany, that growth-oriented
  domestic policies are needed to bolster the world trading
  system on which they depend.""
      Reagan coupled this appeal with a call for compliance with
  allied accords on exchange rate stability.
      ""Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at
  this year's meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in
  Paris and in Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten,"" he
  said. ""The commitments made at these meetings need to be
  translated into action.""

  Higher oil prices and stronger than
  expected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S.
  interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive
  chart outlook, financial analysts said.
      The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment
  during February was above market expectations for a rise of
  170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond
  futures that drove the June contract through key technical
  support at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted.
      ""I don't like that fact that we had a close below 101,""
  said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. The 101-2/32 level
  in the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month
  trading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday
  led to bullish forecasts by chartists.
      But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly
  charts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday.
      Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32
  may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep
  losses.
      ""I tend to go along with the double top scenario,"" said
  Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico.
      Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the fact
  that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has
  occurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals.
      Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leiner
  remains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should find
  support between 100 and 99-16/32 next week.
      The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiner's expectation
  that the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based on
  an improving inflation outlook.
      With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal
  Reserve little room to ease monetary policy, ""the inflation
  outlook is improving,"" Leiner said, and that should lead to
  relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar
  prices.
      Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices
  remains a concern for the inflation outlook.
      Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were
  maintaining production quotas and official prices, and got an
  extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from
  Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday.
      ""The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon,""
  said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer.
      The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely
  ""media induced,"" Singer said. He noted that even though OPEC
  production may be within quotas, ""oil stocks are at
  tremendously high levels.""
      Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay, oil
  prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February, he
  said, and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices.

training/209,Economics,1,"FRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES
  France's right wing government is facing
  growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising
  down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation
  forecasts for this year.
      Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector
  forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation
  estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its
  economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a
  2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last
  september.
      Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures
  would not push the government off its chosen mix of price
  deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.
      But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would
  push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising
  the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.
      And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed
  Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth
  and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year,
  perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential
  elections due by April 1988.
      ""The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,""
  said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. ""We have the
  impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth
  this year.""
      ""The big question is whether the government's policy of wage
  moderation will be maintained,"" he added.
      The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout
  1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises
  justified by increased productivity.
      But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond
  Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already
  rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built
  into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher
  prices.
      Calling the government's policies ""unbalanced and unjust,"" he
  also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He
  announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the
  government would spend two billion francs on a series of
  measures to boost employment and training
      Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate
  Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac
  earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of
  France's unions, declared the defence of its members earnings
  its top priority.
      But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and
  still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts
  said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.
      ""Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist
  government and I dont think this administration is going to
  reverse that,"" commented Michel Develle, economist at
  recently-privatised Banque Paribas.
      Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas
  and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher
  inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he
  said.
      Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more
  than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7
  per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.
      ""But that would still be an exceptional achievement
  considering that for the first time since the Second World War
  all french prices have been freed,"" he commented.
      Finance Ministry officials said that the governments
  abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible
  for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living
  costs.
      But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should
  have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.
      Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long
  as the government kept wages under control.
      Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of
  1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more
  than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,
  INSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better,
  he added.
      Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to
  help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget
  deficit, several analysts said.
      So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value
  Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a
  loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than
  expected growth, they said.

training/10617,Markets,2,"U.S. BANKER PREDICTS FURTHER DOLLAR FALL THIS YEAR
  A leading U.S. Banker said the dollar
  was likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an
  improvement in the huge American trade deficit would be only
  temporary at current world exchange rate levels.
      Kurt Viermetz, Worldwide Treasurer of &lt;Morgan Guaranty
  Trust Co>, told Arab currency traders meeting here that the
  steady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to
  rein in U.S. Deficits on a lasting basis.
      Speaking at the 14th annual congress of the Interarab
  Cambist Association, Viermetz said an agreement reached last
  month among major industrial nations to steady the dollar
  around current levels left many questions unanswered.
      ""I cannot see any chance for a real turnaround (rise) in the
  dollar,"" Viermetz said. ""I believe there is room for a further
  fall of five to 10 per cent in 1987.""
      The United States, West Germany, Japan, France, Great
  Britain and Canada -- G-6 -- agreed in Paris in late February
  to stabilise major currencies around current levels.
      The accord came after months of transatlantic argument,
  with Tokyo and Bonn claiming Washington's policy of talking the
  dollar lower had made life impossible for West German and
  Japanese exporters.
      The Paris accord also brought a pause to the continued
  slide of the dollar engineered by a meeting in New York in
  September 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress the
  value of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances.
      But Viermetz said Morgan Guaranty's economic models showed
  that with no further change in exchange rates -- and continued
  sluggish growth in West Germany and Japan -- the U.S. Trade
  deficit would improve only temporarily.
      He said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs this
  year from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120
  billion in 1988 but by 1990, it would be back around 160
  billion dlrs.
      ""This is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authorities
  and politicians in Washington,"" he said.
      Viermetz said it was only natural that markets should
  attempt to test the credibility of the Paris accord, struck
  when the dollar was trading at about 1.83 marks and 152.50 yen.
      Immediately before the historic 1985 New York agreement or
  ""Plaza Accord,"" the dollar had been trading at 2.84 marks and 240
  yen.
      Viermetz said he believed major nations in Paris wanted to
  see the dollar hold within a ""loose range"" of 1.75 to 1.90 marks
  and 145 to 155 yen, with any attempt to push the U.S. Currency
  lower being countered by central bank intervention.
      The dollar ended in New York yesterday at 147.15/25 yen --
  its lowest level against the Japanese currency in roughly 40
  years. It closed at 1.8160/70 marks.
      Viermetz also said he did not see the U.S. Federal funds
  rate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an
  uncontrolled fall in the dollar.
      But at the same time, worries about the international debt
  crisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4
  pct since this would increase loan costs to the third world.
      The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings together
  more than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arab
  world and Arab banks in European and U.S. Financial centres.
      Formal discussions, which end today, have also centred on
  the role of Arab banks in world financial markets, with bankers
  urging them to adapt to a new global trend towards
  securitisation of  business.
      Hikmat Nashashibi, President of the Arab Bankers
  Association, said Arab banks have to shake off their old
  mentality of commercial banking and concentrate more on
  investment banking.

  The dollar's recent signs of stability
  have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,
  but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until
  after the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.
      ""The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the
  dollar has bottomed out,"" said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.
      Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value
  against the yen and the mark as part of an officially
  orchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive on
  world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.
      On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen
  but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,
  topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.
      Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far
  enough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.
      The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in March
  from 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continued
  improvement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.
      Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if
  further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up
  towards 150 yen.
      ""There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed
  out for the medium term,"" added Tom Campbell of First National
  Bank of Chicago.
      Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing
  expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would
  be reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan's
  larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and 
  more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.
      The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampen
  speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central
  bank intervention to support the dollar.
      The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that
  the U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billion
  dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount
  since the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.
      Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's intervention
  volume as ""impressive"".
      James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,
  however: ""the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the trade
  data are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and
  140 yen.""
      Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York
  warned, ""I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet.""
      Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okada
  said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of
  the U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.
      Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction
  to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,
  which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous
  commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.
      President Reagan said today, ""economic policy decisions
  made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of
  Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be
  ignored or forgotten.""
      ""The commitments made at these meetings need to be
  translated into action,"" he added in a speech, celebrating the
  40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.
      Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,
  analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the
  brunt of U.S. calls for further action.
      Marine Midland's O'Neill said, ""pressure will build up on
  Germany to take stimulative action like Japan.""
      Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar
  could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come
  under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is
  not having much impact on Japan's economy and its trade
  surplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trust
  banks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar
  positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign
  portfolios, while some others have started covering those short
  positions, Japanese bank dealers said.

  The Japanese government appears to have
  little new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Over
  computer chips, trade analysts and government officials said.
      The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300
  mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., In
  retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on the
  microchip trade signed last September.
      A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters ""Japan has done
  what it can, and now we must persuade the United States to wait
  for those steps to take effect.""
      The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the September
  agreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in
  non-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S.
  Chip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17.
       Analysts noted Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
  Industry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cut
  production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in
  third countries at non-regulated prices.
      ""I'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has,"" said
  Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards.
      A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call
  for production cuts beyond those already sought, although it
  would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods.
      Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they
  would consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a Matsushita
  Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in
  imports was not likely.
      Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if
  the United States did implement the tariffs, which would be
  levied on consumer electronics products rather than on
  microchips themselves.
      ""If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time,
  there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,""
  said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co.
      ""The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be
  stopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be
  delayed for another year,"" he said.
      Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by
  stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan
  for semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here.
      ""The American approach is full of contradictions,"" Jardine
  Fleming's Edwards said.
      ""If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing they
  want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that
  hurts the final market,"" Edwards said.
      But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S.
  Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also
  frustration with Japan's vast trade surplus. Some analysts
  argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have
  to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact.
      Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd,
  said ""The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic
  economy and move away from an export-dependent economy.""

  After an already steep fall in the past
  week, U.S. interest rate futures may be in for further declines
  in the near term, financial analysts said.
      However, some analysts said recent sharp losses in bond
  futures have left the bond market somewhat oversold, and the
  contracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery before
  resuming their decline.
      Key to the near-term direction of futures will be the
  course of the dollar, they said.
      ""As the dollar goes, so goes the bond market,"" said Dean
  Witter analyst Karen Gibbs.
      The recent decline in the dollar, which hit a 40-year low
  against the Japanese yen Monday, was reversed Wednesday when
  several large U.S. money center banks unexpectedly raised their
  prime lending rates by a quarter point, to 7-3/4 pct.
      ""Even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar,
  foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar decline
  is over,"" Gibbs said.
      The dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debt
  futures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation.
      Indeed, the falling dollar may have been a key topic at the
  meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy making arm, the Federal
  Open Market Committee, this week, analysts said.
      ""To the Fed, the combination of a falling dollar, a
  steepening yield curve, and rising commodity prices look
  suspiciously like the traces of expectations of accelerating
  inflation,"" said Denis Karnosky, analyst at Carroll, McEntee
  and McGinley Inc.
      Such expectations could mean that ""a shift in policy toward
  restriction of bank reserves is likely to get very serious
  consideration,"" at the FOMC meeting, he said.
      Any such restriction of reserves will not be a highly
  visible form of monetary tightening, Karnosky said.
      Rather, the key to detecting a change will be found in
  seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window, he
  said. Borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mln
  dlrs over the past several months, he said.
      In the meantime, however, ""the market looks a bit
  oversold,"" said Jim Wysoglad, analyst at Golden Gate Futures.
      Wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition could
  drive June bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to test
  chart support near the recent low of 97-13/32.
      Technician Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston
  said that the key test for June bonds will be whether the
  nearby contract holds above chart support at 96-24/32.
      ""All previous selloffs since mid-November have stopped and
  buyers have surfaced at that level,"" Keefe said.
      If that level is broken, and the dollar continues to
  decline, Keefe said she expects the June bond contract to
  decline to test support between 92 and 93, the primary uptrend
  line dating back to 1984.

  Colombia's coffee export registrations

  Remarks by two leading central bankers
  sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in
  the West German three pct discount rate may be under
  discussion, currency dealers said.
      Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that
  monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows
  required cuts in interest rates.
      Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter
  Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below
  its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was
  not making a forecast on interest rates, however.
      Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar
  gained slight background support from the speculation.
      But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80
  pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money
  market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either
  offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate
  and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.
      It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less
  than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact
  expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could
  move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.
      Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative
  capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of
  whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.
      ""In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
  different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
  those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
  mounting economic activity.""
      Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the
  generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the
  first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a
  counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.

  Development of costly shale oil,
  liquified coal and other kinds of synthetic fuels, halted in
  recent years because of cheap and abundant petroleum supplies,
  will become economic again when world oil prices top 30 dlrs a
  barrel, an Exxon Co USA executive said.
      Joe McMillan, a senior vice president, told Reuters after
  addressing a Houston meeting of the American Institute of
  Chemical Engineers, ""By early in the next century, synthetics
  should play a significant role in this country's energy
  supply.""
      McMillan also told reporters at a news conference that he
  believed synthetic fuels would become economic to develop when
  world oil prices reached a 30 to 40 dlr a barrel price range.
      ""You're talking about a 50 pct increase in crude oil
  prices, but I think that time is coming and we've got to be
  prepared,"" McMillan said.
      He predicted U.S. oil demand would rise by about one pct
  annually in the next few years while the nation fails to
  replace its oil reserves through exploration. By the turn of
  the century, world oil prices will be significantly higher
  because of declining supplies, McMillan said.
      Ashland Oil, Inc. chairman John Hall, who also spoke at the
  meeting, advocated some form of federal tax incentives to help
  spur development of synthetic fuels.
      The United States, Hall said, has nearly 500 billion tons
  of demonstrated coal reserves, an amount more than triple that
  of all the world's known oil reserves.
      ""We must encourage research now in order to make synfuels
  competitive later,"" Hall said. The average lead time for
  development of a shale oil or liquified coal project is between
  five and ten years.
      Until last year, the federal government had subsidized
  synfuels development through the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., a
  research program created during the Carter Administration with
  the goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrels
  of oil.
      The corporation was shut down last April when Congress
  refused to continue funding its eight billion dlr budget
  because of uneconomic projects based on forecasts of 50 dlrs a
  barrel oil and 10 dlr per mcf natural gas during this decade.

  J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its
  first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its
  previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status
  its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.
      That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest
  payments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20
  mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the
  first three months of 1986.
      Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities
  underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln
  dlrs in the year-earlier period.
      In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading
  losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and
  underwriting of Euromarket securities.
      Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained
  difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering
  heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether
  Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.
      On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan
  losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign
  exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and
  trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.
      Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and
  commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net
  investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.
      Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first
  quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell
  to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.
      If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means
  that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are
  actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9
  mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume
  payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.
      After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for
  credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared
  with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.
      It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after
  charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49
  mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.
      Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were
  583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year
  earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from
  303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to
  personnel costs, Morgan said.

      Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two days

  European currency markets reacted quietly
  to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
  ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
  surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
      The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
  and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
  reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
  stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
      Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining
  broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
      ""The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
  marks,"" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank
  AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.
      However, she said the dollar could break out of the range
  with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.
  Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.
      Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd
  in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
  the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
  possibly to 140 yen.
      A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects
  a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
      London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb
  underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
  sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
  operators to test the downside.
      Concern that finance ministers and officials still in
  Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
  currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
  worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
  near term, the traders said.
      Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
  communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
  downward trend.
      Traders in several centres said the market would look for
  fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
  defend current ranges, which the communique said were ""broadly
  consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
  intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.""
      Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said
  ""They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon."" The
  U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
      However, some dealers said London-based operators would be
  unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
  Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825
  marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
      Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said
  the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
  market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
  volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
      One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the
  communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
  further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
      The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
  1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre
  accord's supposed currency target range.
      A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
  ready for a period of ""mainly sideways movement.""
      But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
  contributing to greater stability.
      ""Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
  boost,"" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he
  expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks
  in the next three months.
      A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said
  the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and
  should not have produced disappointment.
      ""The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade
  policies to redress current imbalances are of a different
  timescale than currency markets operate on,"" the source told
  Reuters, ""This is a political process which takes time.""
      Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in
  Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on
  currency markets today. ""Did people really expect a patent
  remedy?"" he asked.
      Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only
  the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully
  in the next few weeks for any changes in positions.
      A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was
  now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by
  Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could
  lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.
      Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in
  pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months
  while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to
  support the Paris accord.

      Ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billion
  dlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks since
  February.
      In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest payments

  The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven
  finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies
  has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the
  economic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the
  Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
      Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce
  any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work
  remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting
  world economic growth.üside measures to boost growth, he said.
  
      ""I think it is possible that there may be scope for a
  further reduction in interest rates in Germany,"" he added, but
  stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was
  likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.
      Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on ""a gradual reduction
  of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.""
      He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced
  ""satisfactory exchange rate stability,"" in part thanks to heavy
  coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and
  he was ""content"" with sterling's exchange rate.
      Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May
  currency reserves announced today he said, ""we have been playing
  a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a
  very much greater extent than we had done hitherto.""
      Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may
  falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic
  commitments underlying the accord.
      ""Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange
  rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their
  commitments in Paris ... In this respect."" He said the U.S.
  Budget deficit was ""very important.""
      Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by
  Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson
  said, ""what is really needed in Japan is an increase in
  merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.""
      ""There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural
  goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is
  wholly unjustified,"" he said.
      Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in ""Japan
  bashing"" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation
  package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase
  Japanese development aid over the next three years.
      Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange
  membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.
      He said he thought West Germany would instead come under
  pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to
  jack up faltering economic growth.
      In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring
  forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts
  scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with
  the privatisation of German national industries.
      On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan
  to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to
  make progress in Venice.
      The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign
  debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World
  Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year.
      Lawson said he would seek ""to consolidate political backing
  for the plan at the Venice summit"" and hoped the programme would
  be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.
      He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase
  Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt
  provisions.
      ""First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market
  response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this
  sort of move than they felt before Citicorp,"" he said.
      U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,
  strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.
  ""They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,""
  Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to
  determine the appropriate size of provisions.
      He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be
  discussed at the summit. ""There is a consensus, which we have to
  push further.""

      Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become
  an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and
  had grown in popularity, he said.
      The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, including

  the third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000
  contracts traded daily.
      Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the

  night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the
  Plaza agreement 18 months ago have ""now brought currencies
  within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals.""
      Baker said, ""These exchange rate shifts have generally been
  orderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of
  external imbalances to more sustainable levels.""
      As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances
  ""simply are not sustainable,"" Baker told the ministers.
      He said that the Reagan administration was resisting ""strong
  domestic pressure"" for trade protection and was working closely
  with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill.
      ""While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing
  what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist,"" he
  said.
      Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's
  executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's
  compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this
  fall.
      ""We should pay particular attention to the lack of
  continuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF
  and to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed
  temporary,"" he said.

      State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, who made the

      The move is designed to protect the tankers from Iranian

  against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in
  Britain.
      ""It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing
  operating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries
  from carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing
  them to carry out other kinds.""
      ""I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made it
  clear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall use
  them.""
      He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became
  involved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gained
  more than anyone else from an open trading relationship.
      ""I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this
  relationship is to continue, it is very important for them to
  be fair and open about access to their own markets.""
      On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc

training/2269,Economics,1,"FEBRUARY U.S. RETAIL SALES NOT SIGN OF UPTURN
  U.S. retailers posted stronger than
  expected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analysts
  to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the
  first half of 1987.
       ""My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of the
  business we normally see later in the quarter and the real
  strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second
  half of 1987,"" said Bear Stearns and Co analyst Monroe
  Greenstein.
      ""I don't think March will be as strong because Easter falls
  in April this year,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb.
     Analysts generally average the sales results of March and
  April to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence.
      Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said
  sales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a
  3.6 pct increase last year.
       Analysts noted that February is considered a small,
  transitory month between winter and spring.
      In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by an
  especially soft February last year which was adversely affected
  by severe weather.
      Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales,
  according to retailers and analysts.
      ""February's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh
  merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to
  tax reductions,"" said Greenstein of Bear Stearns.
      Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of
  durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing
  high levels of consumer debt.
       May Department Stores Co &lt;MAY> and K Mart Corp &lt;KM> were
  among the strong performers, posting comparable store sales
  gains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. May had an overall
  sales gain of 15.0 pct and K Mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain 
  last month.
      ""Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programs
  continued to positively impact our sales comparisons. IN
  addition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores, all our
  specialty retailing companies had excellent February sales,""
  said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber.
      Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> posted a 4.9 pct increase.
  ""Domestic sales were led by better than average increases in
  apparel, home fashions and hardware and especially strong
  catalog sales,"" said Sears chairman Edward Brennan.
      Analysts were a little disappointed by J.C. Penney Co Inc
  &lt;JCP> which started out with especially strong sales early in
  the month. Penney posted a 5.5 pct increase on a comparitive
  store basis and a 5.3 pct gain in overall sales.
      Penney chairman William Howell said, ""store sales were
  strongest during the early part of the month, while catalog
  demand was consistently strong throughout the period.
      Store sales activity varied throughout the country, ranging
  from good in the East to weak in the depressed southwest.
      Analysts also said gross profit margins were high as
  retailers were not overly promotional due to leaner inventories
  than a year ago.
      ""February is not a big month seasonally but these numbers
  suggest a fairly good trend for consumer spending,"" said Drexel
  Burnham Lambert analyst Jeff Edelman.

  The European Community (EC) should
  watch very carefully for any developments in the Gulf War and
  their consequences on the oil market, EC Energy Commissioner
  Nicolas Mosar said today.
      Speaking two weeks after a U.S. warship was attacked in the
  Gulf, Mosar warned, ""An escalation in the Gulf would increase
  tensions in the oil market.""
      ""But I do not want to be alarmist,"" he told a news conference
  after an EC energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg.
      He said the volume of EC oil imports from the Gulf had
  declined to around 31 pct of total oil imports in the first
  three months of 1987 against 35 pct in the same period last
  year. ""There are also other potential sources of supplies in the
  world,"" he added.
      The issue of Gulf oil imports was not discussed at the
  ministers' meeting, he added.
      A EC committee of national experts in the so-called oil
  supply group would discuss Gulf oil supplies at their bi-annual
  meeting on June 19, he said.
      But any major decisions would have to be reserved for EC
  foreign ministers, diplomats said.
      West European nations have so far shown little enthusiasm
  for backing a U.S. plan to give military protection to merchant
  ships in the Gulf which could help insure the safety of oil
  supplies.

test/20865,Economics,1,"US SAYS CANADIAN, ISRAELI PACTS SHOULD SPUR TRADE
  Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
  said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada
  and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the
  global trading system.
      He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back
  worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.
      The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay
  to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it
  trade in agriculture and services such as banking.
      Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting
  marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The
  Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet
  been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.
      The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove
  tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and
  many services.
      Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli
  pacts ""other countries have realized that if they want to
  continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had
  better get serious about improving the GATT.""
      The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing
  shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially
  increase the gross national products in both countries.
      Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should
  serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.
      Yeutter said, ""increasing trade is one of the keys to
  enhanced political and economic stability around the globe.""
      He said, ""a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only
  for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries
  that need to increase trade in order to better their standards
  of living.""
      Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress
  made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to
  protectionism.
      He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress
  that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions
  against nations with large trade surpluses with the United
  States if the countries practiced unfair trade.
      The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade
  deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still
  rising.
      Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to
  resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President
  Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.
      Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.
      He said, ""President Reagan will veto any bill that contains
  serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained.""
