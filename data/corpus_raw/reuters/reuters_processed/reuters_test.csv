  The Bank of England said the broad
  measure of U.K. Money supply, Sterling M3, rose a seasonally
  adjusted 2.2 pct in February after a 1.1 pct rise in January.
      The unadjusted year on year rise was 18.9 pct after 17.6
  pct in the year to January, the Bank said.
      The narrow measure of money supply, M0, fell by a
  seasonally adjusted 0.8 pct in February, and rose by a
  non-adjusted 4.1 pct year on year. In January, M0 fell by an
  adjusted 0.6 pct, and rose by a non-adjusted 4.1 pct year on
  year.
      The figures confirm provisional data issued by the Bank on
  March 19.
      The Bank said sterling bank lending grew by a seasonally
  adjusted 2.91 billion stg in February, after a 1.70 billion stg
  adjusted rise in January.
      The measure of private sector liquidity, PSL2, rose an
  unadjusted 0.9 pct in February, making a year-on-year
  unadjusted 13.1 pct rise. Adjusted, PSL2 rose by 1.2 pct in
  February, against a 0.6 pct rise in January, the Bank said.
      It said the public sector contribution to the growth in
  Sterling M3 was contractionary by about 40 mln stg after a
  contractionary contribution of 2.3 billion stg in January.
      Within this, the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement showed
  a repayment of 380 mln stg after a 3.7 billion stg repayment in
  January, while the non-bank private sector's holdings of
  government debt fell by about 260 mln stg after a 1.1 billion
  stg fall in January.

  Senior officials in the West German
  coalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would
  be increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made
  by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month's
  international monetary conference in Paris.
      Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social
  Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also
  attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and
  Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion
  mark reduction would represent net tax relief.
      An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned.
      The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts
  already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks.
      Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief
  would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal
  increase in income tax.
      An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers
  1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose
  children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the
  tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by
  increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and
  medium-sized companies.
      The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of
  a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect
  in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this
  reform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would
  be introduced next year, ahead of schedule.
      The West German government had come under pressure from the
  United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But
  Stoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, while
  the economy would continue to expand this year, the rate of
  growth was uncertain.
      The government said in January it was aiming for real
  growth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but some
  economists have revised their predictions down to two or below.
      Stoltenberg said: ""We remain on a course of expansion.
  Whether (this will be) under two pct, as some people believe,
  or around 2.5 pct as some others expect, or even closer to
  three pct, as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a few

  The French primary bond market is showing
  signs of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy
  and the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent
  interest rate cuts are fulfilled, market operators said.
      The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal
  to the market, possibly at the beginning of next week, by
  announcing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate, which
  has stood at eight pct since January 2, or in its seven-day
  repurchase rate, set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5.
      The central bank's averaged-out day to day call money rate,
  the reference rate for interbank money market operators, which
  reached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct this
  week, dealers noted.
      The Bank of France's ""open market"" policy to regulate the
  money markets since December has been based on a floor and
  ceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and
  seven day repurchase rates.
      For the moment the sentiment is of ""wait and see"" on rate
  cuts, but there are now more optimists than pessimists among
  market operators, a dealer for a major French bank said.
      Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond
  market, noting that this week's monthly Treasury tap issue of
  11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily
  absorbed.
      The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12
  billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as
  much paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing
  needs for this year of around 150 billion, one banker said.
      Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity
  in the primary market at the moment despite competition from
  the surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange.
      There has been a flood of large bond issues, but with
  formulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand
  - with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-rates - which
  have been snapped up, and with generally broadly negative fees.
      Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d'Aide a l'Equipement
  des Collectivites Locales (CAECL) 8.90 pct two billion franc
  bond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issued
  over 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March
  9, which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct.
      Even classic fixed-rate issues, after being neglected since
  the end of last year, are finding buyers, one banker said.
      Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms
  of imminent operations would be set, with great market interest
  focussed on the likely three next issues.
      These will include an expected four to five billion franc
  issue for Electricite de France, to be followed by a bond of
  around one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier, a
  subsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France, and a
  new issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de

training/1963,Economics,1,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS
  Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its
  economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington
  to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining
  restrictions two weeks ago.
      Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown
  of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of
  hypothetical losses. Some of them are ""too sophisticated to
  convert into financial terms,"" one banking source said.
      But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is
  impossible to calculate.
      They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's
  economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.
      ""Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-
  achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only
  contributed to largely internal, economic problems,"" one said.
      The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured
  Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation
  for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under
  martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was
  originally devised several years ago by the Institute of
  National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning
  commission.
      According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish
  economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth
  trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in
  credits from Western commercial and government lenders.
      But the calculations were based on a time when trade was
  booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing
  the estimate as ""a theoretical projection based on a high point,
  which has no real scientific evaluation.""
      A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to
  the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs
  annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were
  imposed.
      Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to
  200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade
  surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs
  against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.
      Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important
  U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,
  chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits
  dried up for economic not political reasons.  ""Poland is
  accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for
  political reasons,"" said one expert. ""It's an illusion based on a
  misunderstanding of Western economy.""
      ""There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone
  who has no hope of repaying it,"" another said, adding that
  Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits
  in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.
      Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as ""nebulous,"" one
  diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders
  and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of
  scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the
  lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact
  on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs
  and lacks the means to modernise its industry.
      ""MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not
  be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to
  regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are
  in play now,"" said one Western envoy.
      He said Polish products were not competitive, and their
  quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist
  measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper
  Poland's efforts to regain entry.
      Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised
  this fact recently.
      Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, ""Making
  up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly
  difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of
  two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of
  exports by only about 100 mln dlrs.""
      While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it
  has a ""moral right"" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says
  imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said
  ""The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing
  of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will
  just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing
  Solidarity.""
      Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in
  talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary
  Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was
  looking for a lead from the United States.
      He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its
  financial obligations to the United States, ""but not in a short
  time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its
  foreign economic partners.""
      He stressed that the U.S. ""had a particular opportunity to
  play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners
  interested in the settlement of Polish debt.""
      Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed
  Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and
  Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and
  said it should now play a more positive role.
      ""As a major superpower the United States can influence
  international organisations,"" he said, citing recent meetings
  aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to
  which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.

  Kenya's economy will continue to expand
  this year and the government will do more to encourage
  investment by foreign firms and the local private sector,
  Planning Minister Robert Ouko said.
      He told a news conference that the government would soon
  create a special bureau to expedite processing of investment
  applications by local and foreign investors.
      Praising the role of multinational companies and local
  entrepreneurs in Kenya's economy, the minister promised to
  maintain a close working contact with the private sector.
      The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in
  1985, Ouko said.
      This was owing to high prices for the country's coffee
  exports, low oil prices, low inflation and rising real incomes,
  he added.
      ""Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices,
  Kenya's economy is still expected to improve in 1987,"" the
  planning minister said.
      ""High aggregate demand arising from low inflation, trade
  liberalisation and disciplined financial management are
  expected to increase output in the manufacturing sector,"" he
  said.
      Agriculture would expand significantly if favourable
  weather continued and farmers responded to producer price rises
  announced in February, the minister added.
      Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the
  long rainy season, which is due to start about now.
      Ouko said the production of Kenya's main cash crops
  increased during the second half of last year.
      Coffee deliveries to the state-run Coffee Board of Kenya
  rose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period,
  he said.
      Ouko paid tribute to the private sector for its
  contribution to the economy and promised to improve government
  cooperation with businessmen by maintaining regular contact
  with them.
      ""I wish to pay tribute to the private sector for its
  contribution to the economy in 1986 and challenge it to
  maintain the same spirit this year ... The manufacturing sector
  grew by an estimated 5.8 pct in 1986, in line with the same
  period the previous year,"" he said.
      Ouko said the ""one stop"" bureau was intended to stimulate
  investment and cut the time and bureacracy currently involved
  in processing applications.
      The planning minister presented a review of the Kenyan
  economy during the second half of 1986 which showed inflation
  falling to 4.3 pct from 10.2 a year earlier.
      This was owing to higher agricultural production and the
  Kenyan shilling's relative strength against other major
  currencies, the report said.
      The average exchange rate was 16.23 shillings per U.S. Dlr
  last year, a fall of only 1.2 pct from 16.432 in 1985. The half
  yearly report said exports increased about 30 pct in
  July-December 1986, while imports rose by only six pct during
  the period.
      This gave Kenya an overall balance of payments surplus of
  780 mln Kenya shillings (48 mln dlrs) during the period,
  compared with a 1.4 billion shilling (87 mln dlr) deficit in
  the second half of 1985, it said.

  The Ministry of International Trade and
  Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand
  outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese
  energy demand, ministry officials said.
      MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy
  supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600
  mln, they said.
      The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in
  Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen
  and a decline in domestic electric power demand.
      MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand
  outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the
  Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.
      They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy
  supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.
      Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric power
  in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27

  ""The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its

      OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln

  A U.S. government trade official
  responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on
  coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombian
  efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers.
      Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative just
  back from trade talks in Colombia, said most producing
  countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be
  agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.
      ""There is one country which evidently still does not,""
  Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which has
  been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas.
      Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook
  for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September
  International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict.
      He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical
  discussions with Colombian officials.
      While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of the
  Colombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe,
  Cardenas left a ""positive letter,"" Rosenbaum said.
      The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last month
  which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula
  for the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concerns
  with the technical details of the Colombian plan.
      Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment
  on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by
  European coffee roasters and traders.
      Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick
  said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving
  averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for
  the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement.
      The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas
  unless ""objective criteria"" which reflect recent changes in the
  coffee market are used to set export limits.

  The United States appears to have won a
  transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest
  rates, European economists said.
      But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing
  the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were
  plunging.
      West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
  Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to
  currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,
  according to official statements released late Monday.
      Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the
  Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks
  liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct
  facility rate offered last week.
      While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank
  president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added
  money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a
  strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.
       ""It's round one to the Americans, "" said Richard Reid,
  senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in
  London.
      But Reid added, ""We shouldn't forget that it has taken one
  of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West
  Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05
  percentage point.""
      Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening
  of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and
  fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.
      Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's
  Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary
  policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -
  the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
      The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets
  and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading
  in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was
  quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.
      Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche
  Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world
  stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West
  German short-term interest rates on Tuesday.
      ""The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market
  losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits
  with Baker's wishes, then all the better,"" he said.
      No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the
  Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises
  in the U.S., Aschoff said.
      Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central
  bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he
  thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.
      Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston
  Ltd in London said ""The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat
  and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the
  security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was
  before the IMF meeting last month in Washington.""
      Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was
  reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity
  at 3.60 pct, Keating noted.
      Economists said the United States now appeared to have
  agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support
  the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.
      Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder
  Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg
  told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule
  out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening
  on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.
      Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West
  Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency
  stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central
  banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them
  to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.

  India's national foodgrain target has
  been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchanged
  from the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in its
  annual report for 1986/87.
      Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87
  due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological
  sub-divisions of the country.
      The report gave the targets for various crops with
  estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,
  in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains
  including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).
      Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was
  possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying
  growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.
      The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with
  greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in
  fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding
  total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84
  respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4
  mln.
     India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes
  of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year
  development plan ending March 31, 1990.
      Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the
  1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap
  of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three
  years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more
  than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with
  good weather, the report said.
      ""The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water
  (irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of
  improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm
  materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be
  vigrously pursued,"" it said.

  The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation

      FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world
  grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in
  1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet
  Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.
      World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to
  rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the
  impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly
  distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.
      ""Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many
  developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially
  on the outcome of this year's harvests,"" FAO said.
      FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at
  a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last
  season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986
  harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.
      FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised

  A group of Latin American and
  Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in
  Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development
  and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.
      Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of
  American States special committee on trade, said he was aware
  of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added ""the region should
  not be the one affected by the trade bills.""
      He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar
  and the budget deficit, and ""it is regrettable to solve it by a
  trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests.""
      Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two
  days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in
  Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit,
  which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.
      Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at
  Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large,
  annual trade surpluses with the United States.
      Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations
  with large trade surpluses last year with the United States,
  but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2
  billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs.
      The European Community has also opposed the bills.
      Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the
  Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in
  the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require
  retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.
      He told reporters the committee would likely mount a
  campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate
  on the Senate floor, expected next week.
      Rodriguez said ""the region needs trade to continue
  development.  We hope this need will not be affected negatively
  by trade legislation.""
      Rodriguez said: ""we need to keep the market opens -
  especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign
  exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue
  national development progress.""
      President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he
  termed ""protectionist,"" and his aides now are mounting a effort

  Publisher Robert Maxwell's British
  Printing and Communicaton Corp PLC said it filed a lawsuit in
  U.S. district court against Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc, its
  directors and advisers to stop, among other things, payment of
  the special dividend Harcourt is paying as part of its
  recapitalization.
      The suit, filed in Manhattan, also names First Boston Corp
  &lt;FBC> and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40,000 shares
  of super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corp
  and the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with
  4,700,000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan.
      The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have
  8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf of
  Harcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as a
  substantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pct
  convertible debentures.
      The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds by
  more than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available for
  dividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulent
  conveyance.
      The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose
  that one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which it
  terms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable to
  repay it.
      Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share to
  stockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced an
  extensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed
  at thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing.
      British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share,
  or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of the
  recapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing its
  alternatives.
      British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation
  with its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt
  failed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on
  Harcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures.
      British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous
  increase effective on the June eight record date for the
  dividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon
  conversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged 
  Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert
  denbentures before the record date because Harcourt may not
  have enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after
  the date.
      British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrs
  worth of debentures.
      The suit also alleges that management, the board of
  directors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme of
  entrenchment through a combination of selling to First Boston
  Securities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price,
  the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertible
  voting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchase
  program and the manner in which its financing has been
  structured.

  executive board producer members after a meeting last weekend

      London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to
  1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February.
      Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failed

      He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers to

  an International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago
  when prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil.

  World oil prices would remain stable
  despite the U.S. Attack against Iranian oil platforms and

      He described the situation as ""extremely tense,"" but said
  Gulf military activity would not significantly affect prices

      Hernandez Grisanti said the supply/demand balance was

  continued.
      Three or four members of the 13-nation Organisation of

test/19000,Economics,1,"JOINT ACTION SAID VITAL TO BOOST WORLD GROWTH
  Prospects for world economic growth remain
  very sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments is
  urgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilize
  currencies and encourage investment, the Organization for
  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.
      ""The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months,
  and ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments
  imbalances are likely to persist,"" it said in one of its
  gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.
      The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of
  western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only
  2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's
  2.5 pct growth rate.
      ""We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area
  comfortably exceeding three pct,"" David Henderson, head of the
  OECD's economics and statistics department, said.
      The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising
  inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S.,
  Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world
  debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic
  downturn.
      ""At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth
  remain favorable,"" it said, citing low inflation in most major
  countries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest
  rates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible
  labor markets.
      But private sector confidence had been undermined by
  uncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that ""for
  confidence to be restored, it is important for governments
  swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments.""
      This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accord
  of the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.
      The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major
  countries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to
  undermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal
  policies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demand
  in the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.
      Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced
  recently by the Japanese government to encourage public works
  and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this
  process, though it was too early to estimate its precise
  impact.
      He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domestic
  demand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.
      The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has
  worsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecast
  to rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct
  increase in 1986.
      There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the
  unemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the
  average rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last
  year.
      The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world
  agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from
  price guarantees and other measures linked to production
  towards direct income support for farmers.

test/20262,Economics,1,"U.K. CREDIT POLICY SEEN STEADY, DESPITE BANK DATA
  An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg
  surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to
  nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as
  long as sterling remains in its present robust state,
  economists said.
      An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the
  past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit
  demand which has largely been behind growth in lending.
      ""In the normal course of events the markets would have been
  extremely worried about that figure,"" noted Peter Spencer, U.K.
  Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston.
      After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,
  which compared won stg August rise, U.K.
  Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee
  from plummetting equities into the relative security of
  government securities.
      Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a
  day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,
  before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone
  throughout.
      U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,
  resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning
  after little more than a token blip as the figures came out.
      Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks
  would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a
  rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, ""With
  the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last
  thing the Bank of England would want to do,"" Spencer said.
      ""The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as
  sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,""
  said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu
  Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money
  measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct
  growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.
      But ""The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed
  down is a rather encouraging sign,"" noted Paul Temperton, U.K.
  Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a
  fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money
  aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.
      It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank
  of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates
  to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by
  news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.
      Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in
  that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.
      Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in
  influencing consumer behaviour, he said.
      In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity
  markets in the past few days, ""There will almost certainly be a
  straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail
  sales,"" Temperton said.
      ""Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in
  consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues,"" he added.
      ""I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending
  figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very
  serious panic and a flight to quality,"" Spencer said.
      A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look
  at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,
  adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly
  than bank lending.
      Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending
  was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy
  personal sector borrowing.
      Figures from the Banking Information Service showed
  personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66
  billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much
  of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments.

  World Bank President Barber Conable
  called on Japan to boost investment in developing nations, for
  its own sake as well as that of the world economy.
      ""Japan has the means to make a major contribution to
  development in the Third World,"" he told about 500 Japanese
  businessmen and academics. ""I would be pleased with additional
  support.""
      With 25 pct of the world's total banking assets, Japan
  could do more to help assist indebted Third World countries
  develop roads, bridges and other infrastructure, he said.
      Conable said additional commercial bank investment would
  also be to Japan's advantage.
      It would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplus
  into Third World economies -- notably those in South America,
  China and India -- that are likely to expand faster than those
  in the developed world, he said.
      Japan is now the second largest shareholder in the Bank's
  concessionary lending affiliate, the International Development
  Association (IDA). It has also agreed recently to expand its
  contribution to another affiliate, the International Bank for
  Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), Conable noted.
      Conable said the World Bank was expanding its structural
  adjustment loans, designed to encourage developing countries to
  open their economies more to free competition and trade.
      ""Adjustment loans could rise to 30 pct (of total World Bank

  Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered by
  U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will
  tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that
  liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,
  a senior ministry official said.
      ""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives
  by other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named,
  said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and
  it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise
  its farm import market,"" he said.
      Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.
  Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open
  its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to
  protect local farmers.
      Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat
  exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.
  End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.
      U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to
  visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask
  Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and
  remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.
      Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market
  share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has
  been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year
  beef accord next March 31.
      Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales
  from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports
  from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although
  the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.
      U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its
  beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain
  imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.
      An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when
  Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has
  the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.
  Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing
  some one billion dlrs in new business.
      The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import
  controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,
  purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,
  prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.
      To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's
  top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove
  residual import restrictions on agricultural products.
      But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional
  reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue
  should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the
  industrial sector.
      ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these
  issues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the official
  said.

  The Bank of England and the U.S. Federal
  Reserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to
  measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not
  show up in bank balance sheets, the Bank of England said.
      The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and options
  involving interest or exchange rates, complements proposals
  agreed in January between the two central banks to make
  commercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar
  standards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said.
      It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks
  have until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals.
      The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma.
      ""On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate
  capital support for potential future exposure -- on the other
  hand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital
  requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. And
  U.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively.""
       At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the
  so-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a
  currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its
  potential change in value due to currency or interest rate
  fluctuations until the contract matures.
      In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance
  sheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of
  five risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the
  quality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the
  contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the
  plans showed.
      The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would
  not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts.
      They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk
  weights. The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S.
  And U.K. Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic national
  government agencies, the proposals showed.
      The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot
  foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and
  options exchanges.
      It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England
  were keen to encourage banks to ""net"" contracts -- consolidate
  multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single
  agreement to create one single payments stream.
      It recognised that ""such arrangements may in certain

  the latest sharp rise of the yen without taking panic measures
  because it expects the currency's appreciation to prove
  temporary, senior officials said.
      ""The market has already located a ceiling (for the yen) and
  market forces are pushing the dollar back up a bit,"" one senior
  Finance Ministry official said.
      He attributed the dollar's fall in recent days to special
  factors, in particular, selling by Japanese investors ahead of
  the March 31 end to their fiscal year.
      That selling largely came to an end this morning after
  about one hour of trading here, the senior official said. ""They
  (the investors) became more or less quiet after 10 o'clock
  (0100 GMT),"" he said.
      After falling to a record low of 144.70 yen this morning,
  the dollar edged back up in late trading to end at 146.20.
  Dealers attributed the late rise to remarks by Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone that major nations had agreed to stabilise
  the dollar above 150 yen.
      Several officials said they did not see any fundamental
  reason for the dollar's recent sharp fall.
      One official even called the market's recent actions
  irrational. If anything, the U.S. Decision to slap tariffs on
  Japanese electronics goods should support the dollar against
  the yen because it will cut Japanese exports to the U.S., He
  said.
      As a result, several officials said they saw no reason to
  alter the broad thrust of government policy agreed to at last
  month's meeting of major nations in Paris.
      ""We don't see any substantial reason to change our policy
  stance,"" one senior official said.

  China expects its 1987 grain harvest to be
  397 mln tonnes, eight mln tonnes short of its target, the New
  China News Agency quoted a State Statistical Bureau spokesman
  as saying.
      The harvest will be China's second highest in history but
  poor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmers
  have kept yields down, earlier Chinese press reports said.
      Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mln

      Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mln
  tonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09
  mln in the same 1986 period.
      Agriculture Minister He Kang said last month state prices
  for grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increase
  the incentive for grain production.

  The dollar's tumble to a record low of
  144.70 yen in Tokyo today motivated some major Japanese
  investors to lighten their U.S. Bond inventory further and is
  expected to spur diversification into investment assets
  including foreign and domestic shares, dealers said.
      The key U.S. 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 fell to a low
  of 96.08-12 in early Tokyo trade against the 98.05-06 New York
  finish, then recovered to 96.20-22.
      Some trust bank pension fund acccounts and investment
  trusts were seen selling several hundred million dollars on the
  foreign exchange market here today, accentuating the unit's
  tumble, securities house dealers said.
      They seem undecided on what to do with the fresh yen cash
  positions resulting from their dollar sales today, and are
  sidelined until the currency market stabilises and the interest
  rates outlook clarifies, a Nikko Securities Co Ltd currency
  trader said.
      The dollar's plunge and low yields on U.S. Bonds will
  further promote diversification into other foreign investments,
  as well as call back funds into the domestic bond and stock
  markets from overseas bond markets, securities bond managers
  said.
      They said major Japanese investors in the past two years
  are estimated to have held 50 to 80 pct of their foreign
  portfolios in U.S. Bonds but many have lightened their U.S.
  Bond inventory to as low as 40 pct.
      Since late last year, Japanese investors, seeking
  substantial liquidity and attractive yields, have used fresh
  funds to buy mark and Canadian dollar bonds and, after the
  Paris currency pact, actively bought French franc bonds and
  gilts while gradually lightening U.S. Bond inventories, the
  managers said.
      Dealers said funds tied up in foreign assets had flowed
  into local bond and stock markets as well.
      The yield of the key 5.1 pct 89th bond dropped to a record
  low of 4.080 pct today from the 4.140 Saturday finish and
  compared with 4.25 pct on three-month certificates of deposit.
      The key bond has fluctuated less than five basis points for
  more than a month here, suggesting most dealers could not
  satisfy their needs for capital gains, dealers said.
      A market survey by Reuters showed some active accounts in
  U.S. Treasuries are currently dealing on Tokyo's stock market.
  The stock market's bullishness late last week was partly due to
  funds transferred from U.S. Treasuries, dealers said.
      Japanese net purchases of foreign securities in the first
  half of March fell an estimated one billion dlrs compared with
  average monthly net purchases of 7.7 billion for the whole of
  1986, Finance Ministry sources said.
      The steep fall is due to Japanese investors' cool attitude
  towards U.S. Bonds, which had amounted to more than 80 pct of
  total foreign securities purchased, securities houses managers
  said.
      Foreign stock buying in March is expected to exceed the
  record high of 1.5 billion dlrs seen in December, they said.
      ""Diversification of foreign portfolios is underway and we
  have bought bonds in currencies such as marks, the Canadian

  A world recession is unlikely this
  year as fiscal and monetary policy in most industrialized
  countries is supporting the economy, Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F>
  management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said.
      But growth rates will be smaller than last year, with 1.5
  to 2.5 pct likely in most industrialized countries, he told a
  news conference.
      Herrhausen said he was confident private consumption would
  support economic growth in West Germany this year, with net
  income increases turning into purchasing power as long as
  inflation did not revive.
      Herrhausen said he did not expect interest rates to rise in
  West Germany this year, but there was little room for further
  falls. Rates in the U.S. were however rising, as evidenced by
  the latest prime rate moves, but this rise would be moderate.
      Herrhausen said he did not expect any major narrowing of
  the U.S. Trade and budget deficits in the next few months.
      One success of the Paris agreement in February to foster
  currency stability was that U.S. Officials have stopped talking
  down the dollar, he noted.
      The recent stability would last until markets decided to
  test the resolve of central banks, he said.
      He noted that central banks had spent some 10 billion dlrs
  this week to stabilize the dollar against the yen in the first
  such test.
      ""A massive attack on the mark, which could come if we get
  bad news out of the U.S., Would require a much higher
  intervention amount, raising the danger of inflation,"" he said.
      Turning to the international debt problem, Herrhausen said
  Brazil's unilateral debt moratorium had surprised banks.
      But the move showed that a real solution to debt problems
  was only possible with the involvement of all parties.

  Asian cocoa producers are expanding
  output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss
  suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior.
      ""Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market
  from our product,"" said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate
  general of plantations. ""We're happy about our long-term future.""
      Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in
  Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable
  for European tastes.
      They were responding to comments by London traders that
  large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesia
  and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa
  prices.
      London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered
  unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a
  high level of free fatty acids.
      Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers'
  Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the
  United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western
  Europe.
      A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the
  London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with
  high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans.
      ""When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything to
  talk down prices,"" the spokesman said.
      He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces.
      PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa
  year ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exported
  to West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to the
  Netherlands and Britain.
      The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry official
  who wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problem
  with quality and would continue to expand sales. He described
  criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as ""trade politics""
  and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it
  did not have any difficulty with exports.
      Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia's two biggest commodity
  producers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the
  International Cocoa Organization (ICCO).
      Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to
  total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987.
      This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because of
  the end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largest
  cocoa growing area.
      Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600
  tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output is
  projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes
  this year as young trees mature.
      Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and
  traders said they could last out low prices longer than West
  African countries.
      According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices would
  have to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to
  make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic.
      Some traders believe the main quality problem is with
  harvesting and fermentation techniques.
      One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually
  indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the
  same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian
  estates.

  said that Europe and Japan were slowing exports and that growth
  in those countries was also decreasing.
      ""In that kind of situation, further sizeable depreciation
  of the dollar could well be counterproductive,"" he said.
      Domestic expansion in foreign industrial countries has not
  been enough to offset the effects of slower exports, Volcker
  said.
      On the value of the dollar, Volcker said he could not say
  whether it should be higher or lower to restore balance in
  trade.
      ""What we do know is that a substantial exchange rate
  adjustment has already been made,"" he said.
      ""That adjustment should be large enough, in a context of a

  One or two large West German banks
  effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at
  the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from
  their overnight deposits, money dealers said.
      As a result, call money soared in active trading to around
  the Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday as
  banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds.
      Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily
  51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at the
  central bank over the first 29 days of the month.
      Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7
  billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion.
      To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raise
  holdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today and
  tomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business because
  banks excessively took up the Bundesbank's offer for sale of
  Treasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for
  three-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market.
      Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday,
  flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return
  until tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said.
      Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name,
  commanded short-term money requirements of as much as five
  billion marks or so.
      With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the
  month, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills,
  draining liquidity for three days. When other banks sought
  funds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess
  funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return.
      One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advanced
  knowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed its
  sales of treasury bills on Friday.
      Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total
  minimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank
  has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate
  the strength of demand for funds the following day, he said.
      ""(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not
  selling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in this
  amount,"" he said. ""If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the
  market then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it will
  be different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so.""
      But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in
  rates, given the delicate state of currency markets.
      International central banks have been at pains to prevent a
  dollar fall against major currencies, including the mark.
  Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer
  undertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar.
      ""The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between
  three and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have today
  cannot be very popular,"" the senior dealer said.
      Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average
  rates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or
  four pct. This is a higher return than they would have earned
  without the excessive draining through the treasury bill
  mechanism.
      Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations
  between Germany's major employers and the unions, the
  Bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to
  monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said.
      Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the
  Lombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion
  marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business.

  offshore area, where a well spudded in February this year gave
  both oil and gas, an ONGC spokesman said.
      The exploratory well, spudded at a depth of 2,140 metres,
  yielded 2,000 barrels of oil and 180,000 cubic metres of gas
  per day, he said.
      ""The well, one of the four structures drilled in the area 80
  km north-west of Bombay, indicates good prospects of both oil
  and gas. We've decided to drill at least three more wells in
  there before starting production on a commercial scale.""
      Production of Bombay High, part of the Bombay offshore
  field, has stabilised at around 500,000 barrels per day for the
  last two years.
      ONGC produced 27.85 mln tonnes of crude in 1986/87 ending
  March, up from 27.51 the previous year. Bombay High accounted
  for 20.61 mln tonnes, marginally up from 20.10 the year before.
  India's total oil output is around 30 mln tonnes.
      ONGC has been exploring the Bombay offshore area, developed
  since the late 1970s, for more oil as production from Bombay
  High has reached a plateau.

  Major cocoa exporters are likely to
  limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world
  prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers
  Alliance (CPA) said.
      The sources said the depressed world market had been one of
  the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the
  11-member CPA which began on Monday.
      They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the
  buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his
  effort to support prices.
      Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed
  operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London
  last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the
  market soon.
      Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa
  surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has
  to buy cocoa under stock rules.
      The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range
  by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise.
      ""The world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting,""
  commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer.
      Another source said that with much of the 1986/87
  (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in
  the near term concerns essentially next year's harvest.
      The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in
  Brazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands.
  This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West
  African producers, where sales are made or authorized by
  commodity marketing boards.
      The CPA includes the world's top three producers, Ivory
  Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.
      The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.

  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
  has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help

  pressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.
      Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's Economic
  Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister
  Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help
  Japan as well as the United States.
      The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by
  Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.
      However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was
  already the world's largest grain importer.
      Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and
  depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food
  requirements in 1985.
      Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm
  products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on
  beef, citrus products and rice.
      Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of

  because potential production is higher than domestic demand.
      The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of
  rising production by exporting countries, he added.

training/11203,Markets,2,"BANK OF JAPAN MULLS OTHER OPTIONS TO STOP YEN RISE
  Today's liberalised financial markets are
  making it extremely difficult for Japan's monetary authorities
  to prevent the yen's rise against the dollar, but they have
  several options other than normal intervention, Bank of Japan
  sources said.
      A senior central bank official said that such methods as
  controlling foreign exchange deals and invoking currency swap
  agreements with other central banks, which have not been
  invoked since 1978, are all being considered.
      ""But the time may not be ripe,"" he said.
      ""In this era of financial liberalisation, it's almost
  impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,""
  said another senior bank official.
      But the first official said: ""From a technical viewpoint,
  the Bank of Japan could activate swap agreements immediately
  after other central banks involved agreed to do so.""
      A swap agreement, an exchange of currency between two
  nations, allows both sides to acquire a ready source of the
  other's currency in case of need.
      ""If the Bank invokes such swaps, both parties would announce
  the decision jointly,"" said the first official.
      The sources said they believed the limit of currency market
  intervention may be being reached after they saw recent
  concerted market action by central banks of major industrial
  nations was increasingly ineffective in propping up the
  battered dollar.
      But intervention is at least an option, they said. Further
  easing of monetary policy will be very difficult with an
  official discount rate already at a record low of 2.5 pct, they
  said.
      Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita has repeatedly ruled
  out another rate cut due to fears it could revive inflation.
      One bank official said he could not deny the possibilty of
  the Bank of Japan activating currency swap agreements with the
  U.S. And other central banks, if these banks continue
  intervening to sell the yen in support of the dollar and run
  out of their yen cash positions.
      ""But we don't think they have become short of yen quite yet,""
  he said.
      The bank has established a five billion dlr swap limit with
  the U.S. Federal Reserve and another 2.5 billion mark and 200
  billion yen limit with the West German and Swiss central banks,
  according to the sources.
      Foreign exchange dealers estimate the Fed had sold two
  billion dlrs worth of yen from its own account to support the
  dollar in New York last week.
      The central bank sources also said Japan may arrange other
  currency swap agreements with Britain and France if they find
  it necessary, but added they are not actually talking with each
  other towards that end.

test/14891,Economics,1,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY
  Kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden
  economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices
  will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists
  say.
      Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold
  oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the
  northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.
      Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross
  domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year
  after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.
      This was after taking into account inflation in consumer
  prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.
      Factors depressing economic activity include the
  6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, which
  threatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the
  Gulf and has sapped business confidence.
      But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September
  when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis
  caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive
  new debt settlement program was introduced.
      The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward
  trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.
      The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer
  spending, thus generating an informal credit system.
      Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are
  still owed by individuals and companies.
      There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)
  in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which
  one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as
  bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it
  will not allow any banks to go under.
      The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of
  problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether
  debtors have regular cash flows or not.
      Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights
  guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance
  in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector
  is the biggest after oil.
      Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride
  out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.
      Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)
  compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last
  year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.
      But strategic diversification into downstream operations in
  Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at
  home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell
  over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.
      Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average
  2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed
  product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as
  crude.
      Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason
  for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic
  inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent
  years and signs government spending on productive sectors will
  remain steady.
      External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8
  billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below
  that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit
  Gulf.
      Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put
  officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income
  of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.
      But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these
  reserves may not be enough to prevent a ""real"" budget deficit for
  the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.
      In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,
  revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,
  doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.
      This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded
  in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at
  up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some
  shortfall.
      Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for
  economic growth this year or next.
      ""It depends on oil prices,"" one said. ""This summer is
  important.""
      Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday
  the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state
  spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the
  economy.
      He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be
  spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.

  The five leading West German economic
  research institutes said the government should do more to
  stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of
  tax cuts planned for 1990.
      In their joint spring report the institutes were divided
  about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct
  expansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross national
  product grew 2.4 pct last year.
      But the report said all the institutes believed that ""more
  must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional
  jobs can be created.""
      The institutes said any step which improved basic economic
  conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. ""From this
  point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be
  brought forward.""
      The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion
  marks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from
  the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.
      However, the institutes criticised the government, not only
  for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of
  its financing had been left open.
      The government has not specified how the remaining 19
  billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,
  though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.
      The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had
  caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what
  exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a
  quick decision from the government.
      They also said the government should reduce tax
  preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a
  restriction of state spending and called for no increase in
  value-added tax.
      The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing
  subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.
      They referred specifically to a doubling of special
  writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a
  package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this
  as an increase in subsidies.
      The institutes said total subsidies, including tax
  preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen
  further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it
  should be possible ""despite ... Major political difficulties"" to
  finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.
      The institutes said that if the government raised value
  added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the
  positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.
      The report also noted that the government was progressing
  only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and
  said more deregulation was needed. The government had to aim
  for more competition, it said.

  target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.
      To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money
  rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from
  11.8 at end-1986.
      Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to
  hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,
  with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new
  wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.
      These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish
  workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.
      He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the
  state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five
  pct wage ceiling.
      Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in
  Spain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first
  two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct
  increase over the corresponding period last year.
      However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the
  peseta to correct the imbalance.

  Rising imports of Japanese-made cars and
  electronic goods may upset West European officials, but they
  generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest
  trade row between the United States and Japan.
      Japan's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe,
  as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair trade
  practices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold.
      The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficit
  with Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanese
  trade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said.
      But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of acting
  with the U.S. To do something about Japan's huge trade surplus.
      ""The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the
  U.S.,"" said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade Policy
  Research Centre in London. ""Basically, their policies are pretty
  much the same.""
      But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Or
  that the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of
  the U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically,
  Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said.
      ""In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here,"" he
  added. ""In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic of
  free competition, while in Europe, the general approach is that
  liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich.""
      Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington's
  tendency to impose so-called ""countervailing duties"" - an import
  tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair.
      In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends to
  be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said.
      In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan has
  threatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronic
  goods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan has
  failed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade.
      But the European Community has challenged the agreement as
  a violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
  practices that discriminates against its microchip producers.
      ""It follows that they're not likely to rally to the side of
  the United States in defence of the agreement,"" said Wolf.
      Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a tough
  line on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the rest
  of Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC take
  the lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row.
      A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels told
  Reuters there has been no change in the Community's position
  since a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent a
  strong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances.
      In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreign
  ministers deplored Japan's continued trade imbalance and
  appealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets.
      EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said after
  the talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC.
      Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw no
  signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad-ranging
  sanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking a
  trade war, they said.
      Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas in
  European trade with Japan, including wines and spirits,
  cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking to
  try to improve the situation, the diplomats said.
      In Britain, where the government is angered over the
  difficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless has
  faced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials said
  last week that retaliatory action is being considered.
      But government officials said last night, ""We are not
  talking about days or weeks. This is going to take time.""
      They said the government would consider its options at a
  cabinet meeting on Thursday, but added that no final decisions
  were expected. The main thing the British would threaten the
  Japan with is denial of access to London's booming financial
  markets, government officials said.

  The Brazilian Coffee Institute,
  IBC, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system when
  it reopens export registrations, probably later this week,
  exporters said.
      They said IBC President Jorio Dauster is likely to leave
  the basic formula for the minimum registration price unchanged
  but raise the contribution quota to partially offset the
  effects of cruzado devaluation since April registrations were
  closed in mid-February.
      To fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have to
  be around 28 dlrs per bag against 7.0 when registrations closed.
      However, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contribution
  quota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets,
  and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, the
  exporters said.
      They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contribution
  quota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnet
  funds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteed
  producer price.
      Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide more
  funds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds last
  week, funds are still being released for subsequent approval.
      The sources said it is still unclear when registrations
  will be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end of
  this week.
      ""Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentions
  know. A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanently
  closed down,"" one exporter said.
      However, before announcing its export policy the IBC is
  likely to wait to see if tomorrow's meeting of the
  International Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board in
  London decides to call a full council meeting to discuss
  reintroduction of export quotas, sources said.
      There is also talk of the announcement this week of new
  measures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could be
  awaiting clarification before making any move, the exporters
  said.
      Another factor which could be delaying the opening of
  registrations is the current strike by bank workers which,
  while not affecting current shipments, could affect
  documentation and currency operations for new sales.
      This would certainly be the case if the IBC was considering
  obliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two or

  Israel's exports to the U.S. can and
  must double over the next five years if the mideast nation's
  goal of economic independence is to be achieved, said Gad
  Yaacobi, Israeli minister of Economy and Communication.
      Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerce
  seminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S.
  were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel's total
  exports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billion
  dlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total.
      ""I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reach
  five billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn to
  function in the American marketplace and place greater emphasis
  on product quality,"" Yaacobi said.
      While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis European
  currencies is a ""bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,""
  Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trend
  toward higher U.S. exports.
      In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rose
  fivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, while
  imports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year.
      Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct
  annually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
       He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passed
  last year and eliminating all duties and other commercial
  restrictions between the two nations through 1994, would
  continue to facilitate the desired export growth.
      Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act as
  an economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S.
  firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentage
  of the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa.
      Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle
  east was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been able
  to achieve its economic potential.
      Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs in
  aid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing
  military conflicts ""which were imposed on Israel,"" he said.
      Short of achieving Israel's full growth potential, however,
  Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic
  independence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption that
  exports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period.

  West Germany takes ""very seriously"" the
  recent undertaking by major industrial countries to promote
  exchange rate stability around current levels, Finance Ministry
  State Secretary Hans Tietmeyer said.
      Talking to journalists before a meeting of European
  Community Economy and Finance Ministers here, Tietmeyer
  declined to say whether the February 22 Paris accord by the
  Group of Five countries plus Canada included secret agreements
  for stabilising currencies.
      But he noted the official communique said the participants
  agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange
  rates around current levels. ""We're taking this sentence very
  seriously,"" he said.
      Tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved against
  the mark since the meeting.
      He said a slowdown in West German economic growth had been
  caused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the Paris
  agreement should help in this respect.
      Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said the
  Bonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster the
  economy but was paying close attention to the slower growth and
  had not ruled out ""appropriate and timely"" action if necessary.
      Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussion
  by the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on the
  economic situation in the 12-nation bloc.
      The Commission has sharply revised down expected German
  gross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pct
  predicted last autumn and says Bonn has the most room of any EC
  country to stimulate economic activity.
      Schlecht said the upturn in West Germany's economy slowed
  in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of
  1987. But he said there was no cumulative downwards trend in
  view that would make quick remedial action necessary.
      He said a number of favourable indicators such as high
  level of investment and a good climate for consumption meant a

  Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of

  rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.
      Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven
  countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said
  central banks would continue to intervene ""as and when
  necessary.""
      He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more
  to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by
  Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.
      Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a
  simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West
  Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget
  speech to the British Parliament.
      ""If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is
  still a risk,"" he said.
      Asked if the United States should consider increasing
  interest rates to support the dollar, he said, ""If there is a
  need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to
  be a rise in interest rates in the United States.""
      Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's
  meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in
  reducing its budget deficit.
      ""We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in
  reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it
  continue year after year,"" Lawson said.
      The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to
  stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six
  weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against
  the dollar despite massive central bank intervention.
      Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in
  the Louvre accord, he said, ""I don't think so. If there had been
  no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness.""
      Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson
  said, ""the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode
  ... but one has to be vigilant.""
      He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that
  ""current levels"" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been
  ""carefully worded."" ""We know what we mean, and we all mean the
  same thing,"" he said.
      Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese
  measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of
  weakness for that agreement.
      Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's
  presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate
  domestic demand.
      They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate
  increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package
  also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during
  the second half of this year.

  putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of
  Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in
  Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be
  ""25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year.""
      ""This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213
  mln tonne (grain) crop,"" the analyst said.
     
      In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235
  mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure
  published in a Soviet economic journal this month.
      USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a
  range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.
      Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest
  progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.
      While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture
  official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be
  as good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest.
      A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mln
  tonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would
  bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes.

test/14890,Economics,1,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING
  Australian markets are booming as foreign
  fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and
  other traditional markets, analysts said.
      High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and
  an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of
  fresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and
  U.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.
      Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in
  and have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they
  diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.
      A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in
  the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the
  currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.
      Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital
  are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily
  inquiries from Japan and the United States.
      ""These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about
  and they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending
  up here with the attraction of high interest rates and
  reasonable currency stability,"" National Australia Bank Ltd
  economist Brian Hamley said.
      ""There is a 'flight to quality',"" Hamley said. ""Australia may
  not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too
  many other countries where you'd want to put your money.""
      The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting
  investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against
  the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.
      ""We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.
  Where some people would be concerned about the value of the
  U.S. Dollar,"" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose
  said. ""Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap
  and the currency looks stable?""
      But turning that capital into more permanent productive
  investment depends on government economic policy, he said.
      ""It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the
  direction in the economy,"" Buttrose said, adding that offshore
  investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough
  economic statement on May 14.
      While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding
  interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as
  easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were
  badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar
  and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.
      ""It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be
  delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one
  might see a substantial outflow,"" Buttrose said.
      Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough
  economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and
  stubborn current account deficit, analysts said.
      ""They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think
  they would like to leave the money here,"" Buttrose said.
      Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased
  interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield
  Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.
      Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an
  element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency
  policy when he said authorities could not take their ""eyes off
  the yen"" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.
      Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked
  successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar
  within the range of 100 to 103 yen.
      Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the
  Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a
  trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.
      Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming
  Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other
  markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the
  weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into
  equities, particularly in the gold sector.
      The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3
  today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while
  the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the
  same period.
      The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese
  companies that have invested heavily in the United States in
  recent years turning their attention to undervalued real
  estate, particularly in the tourism field.
      Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star
  Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs
  as indicative of the type of property being sought.
      ""They think they find good value real estate here which,
  with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of
  investment Australia needs,"" Buttrose added.

  The White House has completed a new

  April should be lifted, U.S. officials said.
      They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked at
  Japan's adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact
  yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.
      But there was no hint what the announcement might be.
      Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of

  honoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.

      The officials added that while the curbs complicated
  U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt 
  Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not
  taking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.
      Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for
  Japan's failure to honor commitments to end dumping
  semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs
  and to open its own market to U.S. goods.
      The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese television

  The U.S. economy in March improved at a
  faster rate than in February, with the National Association of
  Purchasing Management's composite index rising to 53.9 pct from
  51.9 pct, the NAPM said.
      The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct.
  The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for the
  rest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross national
  product growth of about three pct.
      An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the
  economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a
  declining economy.
      The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in all
  of the indicators in the index except inventories, which
  declined slightly.
      New orders rose sharply in March, with production also
  higher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economy
  improved in March. Employment expanded for the first time since
  August 1984.
      Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey
  committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes
  Inc &lt;PBI> said ""the economy ended the first quarter with a
  healthy, if not substantial improvement.""
      Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders in
  March assures a good beginning for the second quarter.
      Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that they
  were paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Of
  those paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at
  2.5 pct.
      The estimated average price increase anticipated by members
  for the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue to
  rise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them as
  being significant.
      The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based
  on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,
  production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.
      The monthly report is based on questions asked of
  purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies.

  Roughly half of this year's expected

      Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date

  Remarks by central bankers raised some
  hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase
  pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a
  move in the near term, money market dealers said.
      Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday
  that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from
  speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central
  bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower
  limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.
      Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the
  drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.
      Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment
  this week dashed some hopes of lower rates.
      The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in
  new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80
  pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market,
  as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.
      But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the
  pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,
  and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to
  3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.
      The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on
  repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.
      Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more
  discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than
  the more public adjustment of leading rates.
      The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and
  allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case
  since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may
  allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.
      Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the
  15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.
      Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week.
  This should then flow back into the market as it is deposited
  with banks.
      Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5

  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's
  forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will
  almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be
  surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.
      The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'
  Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal
  Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or
  end-of-season stocks.
      However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end
  1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln
  was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.
      The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast
  in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for
  soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and
  the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.
      This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around
  31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of
  Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares
  against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.
      ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign
  will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC
  official said.
      Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to
  estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and
  to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.
      He said, however, that among countries to which France
  could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb
  countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.
      The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in
  1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,
  was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize
  Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.
      Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were
  expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.
      It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,
  down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.

test/19318,Markets,2,"EUROPEAN COFFEE TRADE PROPOSES NEW QUOTA FORMULA
  European coffee roasters and traders
  have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating
  International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee
  Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.
      Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee
  Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.
      The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and
  would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an
  unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current
  coffee agreement, van Horick said.
      If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the
  ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new
  agreement, van Horick said.
      Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when
  prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in
  Brazil.
      Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and
  producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.
      ""Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the
  formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal
  leaves it very little to object to,"" van Horick said.
      ""The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not
  reflect supply and demand reality,"" he said. ""Our formula
  builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost
  everyone.""
      Although full implications of the new formula have still to
  be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as
  Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly
  higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El
  Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.
      Because the proposal provides that future quota
  distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it
  should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing
  so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.
      ""If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least
  a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the
  September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a
  new quota formula, "" van Horick said.
      At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.
      ""Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If
  there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two
  months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might
  just get an agreement,"" van Horick added.

training/10704,Markets,2,"BAHRAIN INTRODUCES NEW MONEY MARKET REGIME
  Bahrain is introducing a new domestic
  money market regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred on
  the island's newly launched treasury bill programme.
      The Bahrain Monetary Agency has issued a circular to all
  commercial banks outlining a new policy from April 1 which
  gives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements in
  treasury bills, or through discounting them.
      The circular, released officially to Reuters, said current
  arrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer be
  valid except ""in quite exceptional circumstances.""
      Under the current system, the agency provides the island's
  20 commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short-term
  swaps against U.S. Dollars and, less frequently, by short-term
  loans secured against government development bonds.
      ""The agency considers that it is now appropriate to replace
  these operations with short-term assistance based on Government
  of Bahrain treasury bills,"" the circular to banks states.
      The agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with a
  simultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at a
  higher price which will reflect an interest charge.
      The agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements will
  normally be for a period of seven days.
      Bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of
  91-day treasury bills in mid-December last year and has since
  raised a total of 26 mln dinars through the programme.
      Bahrain's commercial banks are currently liquid and have
  been making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offered
  by the agency. But banking sources said the new regime from
  April 1 will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasury
  bills in case they need funds from the central bank.
      Banking sources said more than half of the 20 banks hold
  treasury bills, although the need by others to take up paper
  could increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allotted
  yields slightly.
      Last week's yield was six pct, although the programme had
  started at the end of last year with rates as low as 5.60 pct.
      Banking sources said the cost of liquidity through
  repurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollar
  swaps. But a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity would
  foresake interest on the U.S. Currency while the underlying
  treasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord.

test/21508,Economics,1,"GERMAN FINANCIAL POLICY MAKERS IN RARE DISSENSION
  Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany's
  central bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are
  normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the
  central bank's independence.
      But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,
  president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a
  controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of
  the country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.
      Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last
  Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and
  interest rates
      Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's
  criticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place
  for foreign investors.
      ""The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and
  Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign
  investors,"" said one economist for a London broker, who asked
  not to be identified.
      Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial
  policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to
  steer the economy through a particularly difficult time.
      ""There are plenty of objective pressures which will result
  in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill
  feeling,"" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.
      News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct
  withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in
  a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and
  abroad.
      Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the
  finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the
  Bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting
  details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.
      Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under
  extraordinary pressures lately.
      Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his
  deputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight
  inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had
  pursued so far this year to promote currency stability.
      In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like
  Schlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been
  warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply
  growth would eventually lead to rising prices.
      Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank
  council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his
  views, bankers said.
      ""Poehl is in a minority in his own house,"" said Commerzbank's
  Pfister.
      ""Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not
  entirely his own,"" said another economist.
      The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,
  they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark
  and hurting West German exporters.
      The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the
  Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.
      Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James
  Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.
      Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986
  war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.
  Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to
  stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.
      One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round
  of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.
      But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for
  Stoltenberg than he had bargained for.
      The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted
  most popular government politician last year, had to face
  resistance from local barons in the government coalition
  parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.
      The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising
  4.3 billion marks.
      But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will
  push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the
  government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.
      Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row
  which has turned into the country's worst political scandal.
      Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last
  month early to sort out a row in the northern state of
  Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.
      The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after
  allegations of a ""dirty tricks"" election campaign led to heavy
  losses for the CDU in state elections.
      Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last
  weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.
      Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more
  remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and
  was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
      When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this
  year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government
  gave Poehl another eight-year term.
      Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he
  hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.
      But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was
  not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the
  Bundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.

  barrels, industry analysts said.
      Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K.
  Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 API
  crude oil from the tertiary ""Alba"" sand through a three-inch
  surface choke.
      ""The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320
  mln barrels,"" Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson
  and Co told Reuters.
      He said industry estimates put the total reserves at the
  field at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity of
  oil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25
  pct.
      Analysts said the results were encouraging, but the
  potential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in the
  field was shown by the fact that the first well had to be
  plugged and a sidetrack drilled.
      ""The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which will
  require a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costs
  up,"" Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said.
      Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil
  found would require additional costs in recovery, the test well
  showed that it flows well.
      ""Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low,
  it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could be
  recovered,"" Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told Reuters.
      However, Chevron officials declined to comment on the
  analysts' reserve estimates. They said that without further
  research and drilling in the area this summer, they would not
  disclose any reserve figures.
      Analysts said that if the field were declared commercial
  and developed, there would be a ready local market for the
  heavy crude it produced.
      ""Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils and
  the price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a
  lot narrower today,"" Osborne said.

  percentage point in interest rates across the board. But Hannes

  Reuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers.
      Vak told a news conference that last January's cut in
  lending rates for commercial customers and for all depositors
  by a quarter point had been insufficient.
      The January cut followed the National Bank's lowering of
  its discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with a
  similar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct and
  deposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct.
      Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the Genossenschaftliche
  Zentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of a
  point, or even half a point if German rates dropped further.
      Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct. A
  widening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West German
  credit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growth
  this year also justified a further interest drop, he said.
      Karl Pale, head of Girozentrale und Bank der

  lower deposit rates but said lending rates should remain
  unchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too small,

  West German rates came down first.

  alone and supporters of a cut would have difficulty overcoming
  opposition from Creditanstalt, Austria's biggest bank.

  The South African Reserve Bank,

  in the 1986 fourth quarter grew at a seasonally adjusted annual
  rate of 4.7 pct versus 4.6 pct in the third quarter and 1.3 pct
  in the 1985 final quarter.
      The bank, in its latest quarterly review, said the nominal
  growth rate for the year did not quite reach one pct after a
  1.5 pct contraction in 1985.
      But it said when the strengthening of the terms of trade is
  taken into account, the real GNP in 1986 advanced by 1.5 pct
  compared with a decrease of 0.5 pct in 1985.
      GDP is the total value of goods and services produced by an
  economy but omits income from abroad.  GNP includes such
  payments or outflows.
      The bank also said there were indications the country's
  economic recovery was becoming more broadly based.
      With the exception of commerce all major sectors of the
  economy contributed to the fourth quarter rise in domestic
  production.
      The bank said major increases in foreign reserves were

  Reserves rose by 1.70 billion rand during January and February.
      Total reserves in 1986 declined by 189 mln rand to 5.70
  billion rand and were equivalent to about 14.5 pct of the total

      The current account surplus amounted to 7.20 billion rand

      The bank said continuing strength of the current account
  has allowed foreign reserves to be ""rebuilt to more comfortable

  support to the exchange rate of the rand if such action were to
  be called for,"" the bank said.

  Chances that the International Coffee
  Organization, ICO, executive board meeting this week will agree
  to resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote, ICO
  delegates and trade sources said.
      ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries are
  ready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side that
  reopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said.
      ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight days
  when producers and consumers failed to reach agreement.
       ""Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions,
  it's difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage,""
  Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must be
  negotiated sometime, he said.
       The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas
  but that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lower
  its export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegates
  said.
       At this week's March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICO
  board is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, the
  reintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and some
  administrative matters, according to a draft agenda.
      The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio
  Dauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and
  chief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the
  meeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a
  non-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned.
      ""I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among
  producers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal
  by September (the next scheduled council meeting),"" Bronwyn
  Curtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said.
      Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a
  date will be set for an earlier council meeting.
      If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect the
  coffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the
  remainder of its life, to September 30, 1989.
      When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largest
  coffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one another
  for sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise.
      Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares,
  under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports,
  but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares
  to be redistributed using ""objective criteria,"" which would have
  threatened Brazil's share.
      At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers,
  Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their
  objections as members of the group of eight ICO ""dissident""
  producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline in
  prices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez
  Cuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to brief
  producers on the Managua meeting.
      However, other producers said they were not aware of this
  move toward producer solidarity.

  down from around 1,550 at the beginning of March.

  Mounting trade friction between the
  U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting
  nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic
  damage, businessmen and officials said.
      They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.
  Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the
  U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.
      But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt
  them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be
  their gain.
      The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on
  imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in
  retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not
  to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.
      Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs
  at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms
  said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the
  new taxes.
      ""We wouldn't be able to do business,"" said a spokesman for
  leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric
  Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>.
      ""If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time
  beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of
  exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,"" said Tom
  Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;James
  Capel and Co>.
      In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.
      ""We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against
  Japan because it serves as a warning to us,"" said a senior
  Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.
      Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last
  year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.
      The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves
  to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.
      ""We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and
  cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we
  want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,"" said
  Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>.
      A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion
  association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan
  might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports
  are similar to those of Japan.
      Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion
  dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.
      In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough
  curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of
  semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the
  U.S.
      In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been
  selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics
  manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such
  a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by
  further U.S. Pressure to block imports.
      ""That is a very short-term view,"" said Lawrence Mills,
  director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.
      ""If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will
  be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong
  is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,"" he said.
      The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,
  accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.
      The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade
  talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,

      ""This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two
  countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very
  serious matter,"" Button said.
      He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,
  Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant
  U.S. Exports to that country.
      Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the
  trade stand-off continue.
      Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined
  a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.
      The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget

      Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in
  view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger
  was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch
  network from scratch.
      The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has
  expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business
  and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the
  wisdom of some of those moves.
      ""They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now
  it's largely out of their hands,"" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd
  financial analyst Simon Smithson.
      Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to
  enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American
  investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.
      Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5
  pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at
  least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange
  personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.
      ""The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the
  Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,"" said one analyst.
      But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.
      ""U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,
  we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three
  years, not until the 21st century,"" Komatsu said.
      Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes
  into the securities business at home.
      Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's
  version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial
  from investment banking.
      But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu
  said he hopes further deregulation will create new
  opportunities.
      ""We need to find new business chances,"" Komatsu said. ""In some
  cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust
  bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.""
      Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such
  domestic securities business as profitable government bond
  dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co
  Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.
      He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering
  the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank
  subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.
       The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to
  securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,
  following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European
  universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.
      But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar
  decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.
      ""We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed
  in two or three years,"" he said.
      Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand
  lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to
  replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.
      The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of
  time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the
  merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.
      ""It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,"" said
  Kleinwort's Smithson.
      ""After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling
  around. It will be the next decade before we see if the
  strategy is right or wrong.""

  Australia faces a major medium term
  adjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance,
  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said
  in its latest annual review of the Australian economy.
      It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-3/4
  pct of gross domestic product, high and rapidly rising external
  debt equal to 30 pct of GDP, growing servicing costs and
  inflation above nine pct, far higher than that of other OECD
  countries.
      A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basis
  for sustained non-inflationary growth and external
  competitiveness had improved, but economic performance overall
  had sharply deteriorated since June 1985.
      A major shift of real resources to the external sector --
  about 4-1/2 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for the
  economy to expand in line with potential, for employment to
  grow, and for the debt/GDP ratio to stabilize, it said.
      Success depended on the setting of right policies including
  tighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the public sector
  borrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour.
      Looking ahead over the next 18 months, the OECD expected
  economic performance to improve, partly as a result of tighter
  fiscal and monetary policy, and a substantial improvement in
  trade volumes.
      It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored,
  the current external deficit could fall to some 4-1/2 pct of
  GDP by the first half of next year, while inflation was
  projected to decelerate to around five to 5-1/2 pct by
  mid-1988.
      Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintain
  the competitive edge created by the Australian dollar's
  depreciation, and to maintain if not boost profit shares in
  order to encourage business investment.
      The report urged Australia to broaden its export base by
  developing viable and competitive service and manufacturing
  industries, and not count on a recovery of commodity markets to
  correct its external imbalances.
      It added Australia should reduce protection levels in
  manufacturing, even though faster trade liberalisation would no
  doubt hurt the most protected sectors of industry.

      Last year, the report noted, the cash flow from operations
  dropped to 1.8 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion dlrs in 1985 and

test/18985,Economics,1,"OECD SEES GERMAN GROWTH HIT BY LOW DOMESTIC DEMAND
  West German economic growth will slow to
  1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domestic
  demand and tougher competition from abroad, the Organisation
  for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its
  semi-annual review of the world economy.
      This view is less favourable than the West German
  government's forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this
  year, but is in line with forecasts by independent economic
  institutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.
      The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year,
  with the gross national product rising by two pct in real
  terms.
      The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing
  through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some
  recovery in business confidence in the near future.
      But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy
  was higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by
  2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986's 3.7 pct.
      While noting that the government is bringing forward a five
  billion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that ""the
  medium to longer-term performance of the West German economy
  could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow
  relatively lower tax rates.""
      Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German Federal
  Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP
  actually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter of
  this year compared with the final three months of 1986.
      Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appeared
  likely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any of
  the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
      West Germany's current account surplus, the target of
  considerable criticism by the Reagan administration, is
  expected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from
  35.8 billion in 1986, before declining to 29 billion dlrs in

  European coffee traders and roasters
  may propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee
  Organization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting
  here this week, traders and officials told Reuters.
      Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the
  possible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the
  world's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the
  next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.
      ""The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil's
  attitude, and this compromise could be a solution, "" one said.
      However, the European coffee trade federation meeting,
  which began here today and is to continue to the end of the
  week, has revealed gaps in the European position on
  re-introducing quotas.
      Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against
  re-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in
  favour with the single proviso that there had to be some
  formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing
  countries.
      The roasters said the positions were generally fairly
  close, and problems with some Government officials.
      Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized
  Government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.
      Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota
  re-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour.
      ""Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the
  end of the week to at least present a common European Community
  (EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the
  International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July,"" one trader said.
      ""We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not
  only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,""
  one official said.
      ""We have learned that we can live without the quotas that
  were suspended in February last year, but would prefer the
  stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not
  simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as
  quota allocation is concerned,"" he added.
      Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the
  likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly
  pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.
      ""Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the
  consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota
  re-introduction, "" he said.
      ""The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new
  Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least
  negotiable position of any of his predecessors,"" one trader
  said.
      ""However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of
  the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under
  a new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which
  gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota
  meeting in September,"" the official said.

  produce.
      Almost 60,000 tonnes of cereals, sugar, beef, butter and
  other food have been authorised for distribution under an
  operation sanctioned by EC farm ministers on January 20 in
  which charities act as executive Commission agents.
      The original idea was to help the needy survive this year's

      The spokesman said the Commission was extending the scheme
  fully in Greece, which has recently been hit by unseasonal
  snowstorms, for the month of April.
      Other EC countries would be authorised to use stocks of
  food for which they have already applied under the scheme up to
  April 30. The spokesman said this would enable distribution of
  flour, semolina, sugar and olive oil at a relatively high rate

      ""There should be another month or two of very weak new home
  sales but with interest rates stabilizing, sale of new homes
  should become more stable by mid-summer,"" said economist

      Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out at

  A voluntary compliance system for
  monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed
  skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and
  trade sources.
      ""Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and 
  importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of
  the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it
  became a matter of the trade monitoring each other,"" one
  analyst said.
      On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said
  the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a
  voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to
  monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.
      Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee
  importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the
  U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring
  authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,
  it will still be allowed entry.
      While many believe producers will not seek to add to the
  overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some
  will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of
  monitoring controls, trade sources said.
      ""Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted
  to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,"" a
  U.S. Customs spokesman said.
      ""Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when
  its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand
  Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to
  destination),"" he said.
      Many see it as a true test of whether producers and
  importers will abide by the quota system.
      ""It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the
  quota agreement,"" said one major U.S. roaster.
       ""Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did
  not act as a gentleman,"" said another analyst adding, ""without
  the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the
  producers' hands.""
      Some feel that importers will take advantage of the
  voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,
  in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.
  Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member
  countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely
  labelled.
      According to customs officials, several green coffee
  importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee
  fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,
  forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy
  beans.
      ""If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for
  one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of
  their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by
  circumventing the quota provisions,"" said Paine Webber analyst
  Bernie Savaiko.
      Still, others believe that producers will not be hard
  pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in
  the U.S. in the near term.
      ""It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not
  have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system
  seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so
  much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a
  threat,"" one trader said.

  to do their best to increase imports, ministry officials said.
      The meeting was unveiled as part of a plan to boost imports
  and help head off protectionist legislation in the U.S.
      Senior officials from the Ministry of International Trade
  and Industry told reporters that such personal appeals appeared
  to have paid off in the past, as Japanese imports of
  manufactured goods have climbed.

      The officials also said they expect the government's new
  trade insurance law to boost imports and encourage Japanese
  companies to set up production facilities overseas.
      Under the new law, the government will insure Japanese
  companies who pre-pay for imports against loss arising from

  Bank of England Governor Robin
  Leigh-Pemberton said the Paris pact agreed between six leading

      Leigh-Pemberton said in oral evidence to a select committee
  that ""we did not swap numbers - we reached an understanding"" on
  how to cooperate towards stabilizing currencies at around their
  current levels.
      He said the accord had brought Britain into a form of joint
  currency float - but one which let it still purse an
  independent monetary policy. ""I would concede that, since the
  Louvre Accord, we are acting as if we are in something,""

  role for the (Group of) seven central banks to operate together""
  towards stabilising exchange rates,"" Leigh-Pemberton said.
      He did not mention this week's intervention by central
  banks to support the dollar, after markets decided to test the
  accord.
       Leigh-Pemberton said that ""the effectiveness of this
  (cooperation) is actually larger than many of us had thought in
  the pre-Plaza days"" before September 1985.
      He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly
  sought by the six nations, and noted that ""we are more effective

      He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly

      Leigh-Pemberton said that, in principle, the Bank of
  England favoured full EMS membership for sterling, provided
  such a move did not endanger U.K. Anti-inflation monetary
  policy. Asked whether he wanted to see U.K. Interest rates
  lower, he said ""the two half point cuts (this month in banks'
  base lending rates) have been appropriate up until now.""
      Leigh-Pemberton said he preferred a ""cautious step-by-step
  approach"" to reducing short term interest rates, not least
  because ""we have a potential problem with inflation.""
      Underlying U.K. Inflation was currently around 4.0 pct, ""one
  of the highest"" among industrialised nations, he added.
      Leigh-Pemberton said the Bank of England had not wanted
  base rates to fall before the unveiling of the 1987/88 budget
  on March 17, but he said pressure from financial markets for
  such a move had proved irresistible. Base rates are now at 10
  pct.
      Regarding sterling's relationship with oil, Leigh-Pemberton
  said that the pound could be seen being undervalued overall.
      He said the current oil price of some 18 dlrs a barrel
  might suggest a level of 74 on the Bank of England's sterling
  index, when compared with the index's level before oil prices
  dropped from around the 30 dlr level. The index, base 1975,

  A cold air mass working its way
  south from Canada may pose a threat to developing hard red
  winter wheat in Oklahoma, according to Eugene Krenzler, wheat
  specialist for the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension.
      ""There is some threat. Some of the crop is far enough along
  so that it's probably vulnerable,"" Krenzler said.
      Accu Weather meteorologist Dale Mohler said cold air moving
  from the north could put temperatures in the middle 20's
  fahrenheit as early as tonight, depending on development of a
  low pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall the
  system.
      If impeded by the low-pressure area, the cold air could hit
  Oklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning. Temperatures
  could stay in the mid-20's for up to eight hours, Mohler said.
      Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crop
  has advanced to boot stage. The closer to that stage the more
  vulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather, he said.
      ""We can handle probably an hour or so down to 25 or 26
  degrees (fahrenheit),"" Krenzler said, ""as long as we don't have
  a lot of wind.""
      ""If we do get six hours down below 25 degrees I'd say we
  have a good chance of significant damage to the heads,"" he
  said.
      Krenzler said early planted stands in the north-central and
  southwestern parts of the state are probably most vulnerable.
  Crops in the panhandle of Oklahoma and Texas are less developed
  and have some snow cover protection from the cold, he noted.

  economic growth.
      In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs
  here, Poehl said ""It would be an extremely risky policy to aim
  for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to
  correct the trade deficit.""
      He said the United States could face a vicious circle of
  depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that
  route.
      Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet
  U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,
  accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating
  above-target money supply growth.
      He said he would have been happy to have brought forward
  five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to
  the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced
  political constraints getting such measures through the upper
  house of the West German parliament.
      But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could
  accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.
      Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about
  one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial
  erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing
  demand at home.
      ""A further appreciation of the mark could even be an
  obstacle to further growth,"" he said.
      Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply
  growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and
  because external factors, including low oil prices and
  favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.
      But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma
  over monetary policy.
      The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the
  reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany
  was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.
      ""For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more
  on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary
  money supply. But we must be very careful,"" he said.
      He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's
  trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as
  the United States.
      Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary
  officials of major industrialized countries, saying the
  importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange
  rates had been underestimated.
      All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the
  right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he
  said.
      ""This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the
  part of our American colleagues,"" he said.
      But he said there was still a danger that the correction of
  the dollar's value could overshoot.

  Italy's economic outlook for 1987 and 1988
  is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly
  lower growth, higher unemployment and an increased trade
  deficit, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
  Development (OECD) said.
      But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast a
  slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Last
  year Italy ranked as one of the OECD's fastest growing
  economies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct.
      The OECD said Italy's GDP may grow by three pct in 1987,
  but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.
      The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five
  pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in
  import prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labour
  costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the report
  said.
      This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demand
  should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption
  made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.
      Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration in
  Italian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports and
  adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result in
  a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account.

      They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of
  their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened
  economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of

  undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.
      They agreed, however, that further actions will be
  essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain

      In this connection they welcomed the proposals just
  announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan
  for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's
  economy through early implementation of a large supplementary
  budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as
  unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.

test/15551,Economics,1,"GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS
  The global economy is expected to
  weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious
  poverty outlook, economic analysts said.
      For finance ministers and central bankers attending this
  week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund
  and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an
  additional concern.
      The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct
  this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.
      In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a
  measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to
  2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.
      For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,
  another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0
  pct from 3.5 pct last year.
      The new figures are considered a major disappointment to
  the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the
  industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil
  prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope
  with growing mounds of debt.
      IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed
  the industrial country economies would move up to an annual
  growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.
      Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some
  time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into
  an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.
      Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier
  states for markets for their products as well as financial
  assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' 
  economies poses fundamental worries.
      Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have
  only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,
  including the key one of exports.
      The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,
  has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it
  too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only
  2.3 pct, according to the IMF.
      For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the
  United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to
  ignite their economies but with little apparent success.
      The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and
  the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade
  deficit.
      Reagan administration officials have been saying that the
  impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much
  slower than expected.
      The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that ""it has
  to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to
  work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years
  to get a resonably complete effect.""
      The report added, however, ""the adjustments may take even
  more time on this occasion.""

test/15364,Economics,1,"BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION
  Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler
  called on central banks of major industrialised nations to
  cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.
      In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released
  here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was
  protectionism and control on capital movements.
      ""Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market
  transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have
  them,"" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would
  have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop
  to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.
      Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets
  had parted company with transactions in goods, services and
  investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that
  determined market trends.
      Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to
  grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates
  would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.
      ""In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
  different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
  those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
  mounting economic activity,"" Koehler said.
      The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.
  Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation
  going by talking the dollar down posed problems.
      The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep
  rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost
  of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports
  to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to
  make itself felt compared with the price effect.
      ""Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going
  further than would be necessary to adjust the current account
  over the medium term,"" Koehler said.
      A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur
  only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.
  In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should
  rise faster than GNP.
      ""In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,"" Koehler said.
      If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be
  prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by
  an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..
      But only if there was an appropriate interest rate
  differential would Europe and Japan look for financial
  investment in the U.S.
      When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank
  had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its
  measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.
      Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates
  by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading
  interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market
  and its substantial impact on exchange rates.
      It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of
  price stability, economic growth and full employment but also
  to tackle international problems like the exchange rate
  problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.
      A strategy had to be designed that helped ""the safeguarding
  of non-inflationary economic growth in an international
  monetary system largely free of disruptions,"" Koehler said.
      Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was
  necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed
  to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over
  the next few years and intervention points should not be set,
  because they were only testing points for the market, he said.
      In order to keep the international monetary system free of
  disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but
  also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.

  The government must announce harsh cuts
  in spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to give

      Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against the

  Business Indicators publication.
      ""For the past two years, the government has struggled with

  sees as politically practicable,"" it said.
      The political climate meant there would be a continued

      ""The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revival
  of business investment will be further postponed,"" it said.
      The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted by
  export and import-replacement industries which had created a
  false suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance of

      In its economic forecasts, ANZ said it expected moderate

  South Africa recorded annualised
  real growth in GDP of 3.25 pct in the first quarter of this
  year and the economy should achieve the government's target of
  three pct growth for 1987, the Reserve Bank said.
      The South African central bank said in its quarterly
  bulletin that confidence in the economy improved from January
  to May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in the
  nation's gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement
  in the rand's exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents.
      It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in the

test/19028,Markets,2,"FED DATA SUGGEST NO CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY
  New U.S. Banking data suggest the
  Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path
  and is not signalling any imminent change of course, economists
  said.
      But they also said that if money supply growth remains
  weak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline
  suggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen its
  credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary
  policy.
      A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a
  forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June
  8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a
  decline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs
  to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.
      Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for
  the week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has
  fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,
  economists said.
      ""M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,"" said Bill Sullivan
  of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
      While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of
  economic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned
  the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth
  in the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen
  as better gauges of economic growth.
      Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both
  measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's
  5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.
      If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,
  concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,
  could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.
      ""Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open
  market position? No,"" Sullivan said. ""But does this mean the end
  of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes.""
      Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings
  of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period
  were lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had
  targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.
      But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day
  net miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higher
  borrowings target would probably have been reached.
      A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in
  auto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,
  while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has
  helped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.
      ""If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed
  easing at some point,"" he said.
      Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little
  attention to weak money supply growth. ""It has been a number of
  years since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the
  economy,"" one said. ""I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is
  falling apart and the Fed should ease.""
      Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a
  prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary
  policy.
      They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates
  for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and
  higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke
  off econmomic growth.
      But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late
  April. ""The Fed has to determine if this represents a
  fundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives
  them more room to ease,"" he said.

  The economy faces lackluster growth
  and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement
  in U.S. exports should falter, economists say.
      Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness
  in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further
  hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.
      ""These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength
  to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?"" said Lyle
  Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers
  Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official.
      The Commerce Department said this week that the economy
  grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but
  a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.
      Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending
  rose a weak 0.1 per cent.
      ""Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --
  are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, ""
  Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,
  told Reuters.
      Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow
  because inflation is rising faster than real wages.
      To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,
  returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost
  personal income and consumption, he says.
      ""I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to
  keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,""
  Gramley said.
      Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters
  that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the
  result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last
  and said the recovery was showing anemia.
      Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, ""The pace
  of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into
  monetary policy"" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be
  accommodative.
      Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct
  forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if
  the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add
  to the risk of a recession.
      Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May
  came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an
  inventory overhang still exists.
      He says the boost in production came from smaller
  industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have
  improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.
      ""They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in
  economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a
  recession,"" Mauro said.
      In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl
  Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the
  trade deficit will continue to improve.
      ""Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and
  into 1988 are still quite favorable,"" he said.
      But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in
  inflation.
      Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers
  Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5
  to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after
  a 1.1 pct increase in 1986.
      The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil
  and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.
      ""The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets
  out of the bottle, it continues to persist,"" he said, adding he
  would like the Fed to tighten credit.
      A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the
  dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says
  a prominent international banker.
      Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National
  Press Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and
  the mark will continue for years because the United States is
  the world's largest debtor nation.
      The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a
  further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that
  the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever.
  ""It is very difficult to be optimistic,"" Gut said.

  West German industrial production,

      The ministry had originally estimated that industrial
  production fell 3.0 pct in January.
      The February figure is likely to be revised upwards by just
  under one percentage point next month when the March figure is
  released, a ministry statement said.
      The industrial production index, base 1980, stood at a

  104.5 in December. The ministry had previously put the January
  and December indices at 101.6 and 104.7 respectively.
      In February 1986 the output index had stood at 103.7,
  producing a year-on-year rise for February 1987 of 0.4 pct.
      The February rise in production was aided by a sharp 19 pct

  mining output 10 pct.
      Manufacturing industry's production fell 1-1/2 pct in

  Based on field travel in the

      The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about
  20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.
      It said generally favorable weather from early December
  through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.
      However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days

  which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the

      The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create
  serious storage problems, the report said.
      Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by
  more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are
  expected to be above average, it said.
      Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop
  crop has been harvested.

  Merrill Lynch and Co Inc &lt;MER>
  subsidiary seeking to take over of Borg-Warner Corp said it
  could realize a 30 mln dlr fee for its efforts, whether or not
  the deal, which it values at 4.7 billion dlrs, succeeds.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30
  mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealer
  manager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed.
      But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mln
  dlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another party
  holding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct.
      The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in any
  tender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealer
  manager services or for break-up of the deal.
      Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group of
  investors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tender
  offer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock.
      The company's board has approved the plan, which was
  intended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp.
      Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series A
  preferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr a
  share exercise price before the merger is effective, it said.
      Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possible
  leveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December.
      At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it would
  consider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,
  if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it said
  it was told the company had decided against a buyout.
      But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr a
  share proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said.
      Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warner
  management was asked not to take part in the new deal and it
  was conditioned upon payment of the fees.
      In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will also
  get up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses in
  the tender offer.
      Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warner
  as a subsidiary with its current officers keeping their
  positions.
      But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it is
  considering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number of
  subsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger.
      All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130
  mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal.
      Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debt
  of Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said.
      To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects to
  borrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mln
  dlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs of
  non-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynch

  Tokyo's foreign exchange market is watching

      ""The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is
  considered to be the lower end of the reference range. If the
  currency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,""
  said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichi
  Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.
      The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Friday
  closes of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.
      The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of
  140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New York
  and 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.
      The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.
  Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.
      ""The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish
  sentiment after Baker's comments,"" said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. He
  said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among
  the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the
  Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.
      The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day
  drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness
  in U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.
      Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he
  strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest
  rates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience
  with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord
  due to their fears of increasing inflation.
      Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary
  pressures also slow domestic demand.
      West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to
  boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Trade
  deficit, Tanaka said.
      U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a still
  massive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interest
  rates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.
      ""Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations
  coordinate dollar buying intervention,"" said Soichi Hirabayashi,
  deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange
  department.
      The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally
  considered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.
      ""The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near
  future and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nations
  failing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvre
  accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,""
  Hirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as low
  as 135 yen soon.

  Britain's gold and currency reserves
  showed an underlying rise of 1.785 billion dlrs in March after
  a 287 mln dlr rise in January, the Treasury said.
      This was considerably above market expectations for a 650
  mln dlr rise.
      The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England
  operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of
  borrowings and repayments.
      The Treasury declined comment on the figures. Last month it
  said the Bank of England took the opportunity of strong demand
  to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn.
      Actual reserves rose by 1.89 billion dlrs, after rising 305
  mln in February, to 22.26 billion. Total reserves were revalued
  to 27.04 billion dlrs, but would have totalled 24.15 billion
  under the previous valuation, the Treasury said. Gold reserves
  were revalued by 895 mln dlrs, while SDRs, ECU and convertible
  currency holdings were revalued by 1.995 billion.
      Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were
  361 mln dlrs last month, after 36 mln in February. Repayments
  were 240 mln dlrs after the previous 16 mln. Capital repayments

  Representatives of major U.K. Based banks
  are meeting here today to consider a new plan for reducing the
  cost of financing British exports guaranteed by the Export
  Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), senior banking sources
  said.
      The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGD
  and the Bank of England.
      Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment on
  the plan. However, bankers said one of the main points under
  discussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's medium
  term credit portfolio in the international capital markets.
  
      The proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins
  on ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the size
  and maturity of the credit and the currency.
      The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankers
  said that while these rates would reduce a bank's return they
  would still be more than those proposed about a year ago when
  the government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate another
  cost reduction plan.
      At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow the
  ECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existing
  government backed credit in the capital markets.
  
      On credits that are refinanced an original lender would
  receive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mln
  stg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions.

  Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
  Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed
  their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the
  market of their resolve.
      At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa
  said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a
  totally new statement was needed.
      The speculative selling did not reflect economic
  fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a
  reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he
  said.
      He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had
  concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the
  mark, had remained stable.
      Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the
  Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental.
      ""As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression
  of 'current level' is rather vague idea,"" he said.
      The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the
  range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.
      It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing
  a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market,
  Miyazawa said.
      Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the
  statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven
  because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other
  major currencies largely have been stable.
      He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has
  justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other
  nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short
  period since the Paris agreement.
      Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese
  semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7
  meeting and did not affect the currency talks.
      The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing
  countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative
  outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago.

  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded
  a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the
  United States over trade in computer microchips.
      ""Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by
  explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that
  need to be corrected,"" he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as
  saying.
      While expressing regret over America's decision to impose
  tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said
  Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington
  to help settle the dispute.
      Government officials said Japan would make a formal request
  next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would
  probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17
  deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect.
      Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan
  investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are
  dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets.
      Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300
  mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic
  goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to
  live up to their bilateral chip pact.
      That agreement, hammered out late last year after months of
  heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price
  chips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips.
      Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory
  than those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura,
  who earlier today said Japan was ready to take ""appropriate
  measures"" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions.
      Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
  officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura's
  remark and said that his main message was that the two sides
  need to talk urgently about the issue.
      But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the
  United States to GATT, the Geneva-based international
  organization which polices world trade, if Washington imposed
  the tariffs.
      Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article
  23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they
  said. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panel
  to consider the legality of the U.S. Action.
      But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. ""It
  may be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the United
  States may lift its decision at an early date,"" Tamura said.
      In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, President
  Ronald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had
  evidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in world
  markets and had opened up its own market to imports.
      Japanese government officials said they are confident they
  can make the pact work.
      They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chips
  through unregulated distributors has all but dried up after
  MITI instructed domestic makers to cut output.
      While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japanese
  imports of American chips, MITI officials said that the
  ministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens.
      The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users,
  some of whom are also leading producers, to step up their
  purchases of foreign semiconductors.
      A spokesman for one of the companies, Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T>
  said his firm would do just that and could announce its plans
  in the next week or so. He expects other Japanese companies to
  do likewise.

  South Korea's trade surplus is growing too
  fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it
  down, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.
      He told a press conference the government planned to
  increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market
  to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold
  the surplus ""at a proper level.""
      But he said the government would not allow the won to
  appreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea has
  been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.
      The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with
  the U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3
  billion dlrs in 1985.
      Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects
  were bright for the South Korean economy, but the government
  would try to hold the current account surplus to around five
  billion dlrs a year for the next five years.
      ""Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five
  billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in
  exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But now
  the surplus is growing faster than we expected,"" he said.
      Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35
  pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this
  year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.
      Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to a
  surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr
  deficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the
  country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first
  time.
      South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs
  in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest
  in Asia.
      ""This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the
  major constraints on our development... Last year was a major
  turning point for the Korean economy,"" Kim said.
      Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of
  foreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from
  about 50 pct in 1986.
      ""The government, however, does not want to accelerate
  reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,"" he
  said.
      Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation
  and lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,
  particularly the United States.
      ""We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but
  we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a
  proper level,"" Kim said.

  Texaco Inc &lt;TX> said its decision to
  file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
  code will not affect the majority of its businesses.
      It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its
  32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property,
  plant and equipment, were free of the action.
      Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operating
  subsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, are
  affected, it said.
      But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents
  per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments
  on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.
      Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were
  demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a
  result of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.
      Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond
  of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985
  judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's
  1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp &lt;GTY>. The bond almost
  matches the damages awarded against Texaco.
      Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could begin
  to attach its assets to secure the judgment.
      Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut
  Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to
  the Texas courts.
      Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all
  Texaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of
  the Pennzoil lawsuit.
      ""Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond
  issue and the larger dispute failed,"" James Kinnear, Texaco's
  president and chief executive officer, told reporters.
      Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers on
  Friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until
  the end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.
      Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash
  bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of
  earnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not
  sell any assets, Kinnear said.
      Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of
  credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under
  11.1 billion dlrs, he added.
      Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the
  company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on
  Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for
  bankruptcy.
      He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a
  confidentiality agreement between the two companies. ""Texaco
  told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go
  to bankruptcy court,"" Jamail said.
      Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would
  prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were
  ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.

training/3024,Economics,1,"DUTCH PLANNING AGENCY FORECASTS LOWER GROWTH
  Dutch economic growth is slowing as a
  firming guilder cuts competitiveness abroad and industries
  reduce the pace of investment, the Dutch official planning
  agency CPB said.
      The Centraal Planbureau, publishing its 1987 economic
  outlook, said Dutch Net National Income (NNI) was expected to
  grow by one pct this year, down from two pct growth recorded in
  1986 and 2.5 pct in 1985 and 1984.
      Dutch Gross National Product is expected to rise to 432.20
  billion guilders in 1987 in constant prices, a two pct increase
  from last year's 423.95 billion.
      The CPB, forecasting an 8.5 pct increase in the value of
  the guilder on a trade-weighted basis compared with 10.0 pct
  last year, said the dollar was expected to trade at an average
  of 2.0 guilders in 1987 compared with 2.45 guilders in 1986.
      ""The higher guilder is causing a substantial fall in unit
  labour costs abroad, when measured in guilder terms, while
  these are rising slightly in the Netherlands,"" the CPB said.
      More of economic growth now depended on domestic
  consumption, the CPB said, but noting that higher margins set
  by domestic producers and importers mitigated the effect on
  purchasing power of lower import costs and deflation.
      Consumer prices were set to fall by 1.5 pct this year, the
  CPB said. Inflation was zero last year.
      Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by five
  pct this year, a slowdown compared with 11.5 pct growth last
  year, the CPB said.
      Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue to
  condition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recent
  years, the CPB said, noting a continued depressing impact of
  these factors on Dutch competitiveness.
      In addition, it noted a slight rise in taxation and social
  security costs to employers.
      The CPB, forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 7.2
  pct of Net National Income in 1987 from 6.3 pct last year,
  urged the government to cut expenditure further to bring down
  the deficit and reduce tax and social security payments in
  future.
      Dutch government revenue is being depressed further by
  falling income from natural gas sales in 1987, the CPB said.
      It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675,000 this
  year from 710,000 last year.
      While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB is
  within its latest forecast, issued last month, of 1.5 to two
  pct growth, the figure is well above recent market estimates.
      Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson said in
  its February economic outlook that GDP growth at constant
  prices was expected to be 1.1 pct this year and market analysts
  had expected the CPB's final forecast to be below its own
  latest estimate.
      ""It is too early to comment because I haven't seen the whole
  document yet, but it would seem we are more pessimistic in some
  of our estimates,"" a Pierson economist said.
      The CPB forecast 2.5 pct export growth in volume terms in
  1987, after four pct growth last year. Excluding energy
  exports, the 1987 figure would be two pct, it said.
      Imports were set to rise by 4.5 pct this year compared with
  four pct in 1986 in volume terms, the CPB said.
      The balance of payments would see a sharp decline in the
  surplus, to six billion guilders in 1987 compared with 12.1
  billion last year, the CPB forecast.

  A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome
  Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>
  may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door
  for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
      Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
  of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
  debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
  substantial payments to creditors will expire.
      Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders
  that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.
      Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
  public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
  negotiations.
      TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt
  restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
  Ltd said from Toronto.
      Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow
  creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
  to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
  cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
      ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
  even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
  Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""
  said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
  Calgary.
      TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome
  was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
  refinancing packages, Gobert said.
      The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome
  since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
  to agree to a restructuring, he added.
      ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
  any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said.
      Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
  TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
  the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other
  possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to
  us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
  reluctant to come forward,"" he said.
      Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal
  offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
  confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
      Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
  with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other
  unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and
  financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
  TransCanada's.
      Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price
  for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
      However, he said not enough financial details are known
  about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
  TransCanada's proposed offer.

training/1611,Economics,1,"TURKEY SEES 1.5 BILLION DLR DEFICIT IN 1986
  Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments
  deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking
  steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali
  Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning
  Organisation said.
      He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of
  economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985,
  which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.
      Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a
  drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury
  wholesale index last year.
      This year's target of 20 pct ""might be attainable but the
  economic management will have to be careful,"" he said.
      Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme
  which is central to the government's economic planning, said
  Turkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account
  shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.
      ""We must alleviate the current account substantially to
  sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure
  over the last five years,"" he added.
      His comment echoed last October's Organisation for Economic
  Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said
  Ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms
  would look better if inflation were lower and the current
  account deficit cut or turned into a surplus.
      ""In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector
  investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a
  percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible
  improvement in the current account deficit,"" he said.
      Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was
  also to blame for the high deficits.
      Appropriations to government departments had been cut by
  eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign
  borrowing by municipalities had been restrained.
      ""We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the
  investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations,"" he
  said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing
  requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated
  5.6 pct in 1986.
      More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also
  targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage
  exports, and production incentives were being considered.
      ""We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected
  into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion
  policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and
  local private capital come more into play as far as
  manufacturing capacity is concerned,"" Tigrel said.
      He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish
  economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under
  way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate
  policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done
  in a country where the state still dominates industry and the
  currency is only partially convertible.

      Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8
  pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.
      The report was released before the Commerce Department
  reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,
  after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal
  consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with
  a 0.6 pct increase the month before.
      The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost
  consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9
  pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.
      This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income 
  growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.
      As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power
  of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs
  this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.
      The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing
  starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in
  1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.
      ""For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988
  or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,"" Van Dyke said.
      Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on an
  improvement in trade. ""However, with protectionist attitudes on
  the rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,"" he
  added.

  British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay
  7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has
  signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said.
      ""I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and
  clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they
  think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,""
  said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
      BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70
  dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already
  own.
      ""It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the
  war and oil prices are not going to crack,"" said Prescott, Ball
  and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier.
      ""Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the
  energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those
  that are acquisition targets,"" Lazier said.
      One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an
  energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl
  Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a
  Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock.
      Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms
  falling into takeover situations for several years, with the
  exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp &lt;AHC>. He said most of
  the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking
  which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point
  that they have become unattractive.
      U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon
  Corp &lt;XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> jumped
  1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco &lt;TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal
  Corp &lt;UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY>
  climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp &lt;AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4.
      Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to
  71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4.
  Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its
  offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it
  would not raise the 70 dlr bid.
      British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8.
      Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in
  the first place indicates that the British oil giant has
  changed its outlook for the oil industry.
      Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the
  more bearish positions on oil prices.
      ""They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a
  barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty
  retreat from that point of view,"" Margoshes said.
      ""They are more appropriately today looking more
  optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs
  (long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that
  will be exceeded,"" Margoshes said.
      The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was
  trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel.
      Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy
  up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when
  oil prices were falling last year.
      They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly
  more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil
  field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in
  the Alaskan North Slope.
      Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely
  attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and
  has hard-to-replace reserves.
      ""I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to
  increase their position in the U.S. market,"" Dean Witter
  analyst Eugene Nowak said.
      Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of the
  British government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP
  stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding
  sometime in the year beginning April one.
      After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserves
  would be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is
  held in the U.S.
      ""The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it
  into the United States. No other market can handle all that
  stock,"" said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua.
      In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on
  revenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the year
  earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs.
