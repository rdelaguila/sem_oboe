SUMMARY BY CLUSTER:
----------------------------------------

CLUSTER 0:
  Key terms: sunday, tsunami, large_integer, digital_computer, day_of_rest, catastrophe, thousand, inhabitant, pc, virus
  
  Explanation: The cluster revolves around themes of rest, disaster, and computing, intertwining cultural practices, natural phenomena, and technological advancements.
  
  Scores:
     • Coherence: 4/5
     • Relevance: 3/5
     • Coverage: 4/5
  
  Strengths: Links terms through thematic coherence, Broadens perspective by including natural phenomena and cultural practices
  Weaknesses: Lacks specificity to technology domain, Could benefit from more direct connections to computing concepts
  
  Justification: The explanation is coherent in linking the terms through themes of rest, disaster, and computing. It shows relevance to technology by connecting disasters with computing, but could be more specific to the tech domain. Coverage is good, addressing key semantic relationships.
