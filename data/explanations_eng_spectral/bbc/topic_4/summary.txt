Number of identified clusters: 2
Automatic optimal number: 2
Number selected: 2
Clustering quality (Silhouette): 0.220
Method: Spectral clustering + Explanatory LLM

SUMMARY BY CLUSTER:
----------------------------------------

CLUSTER 0:
  Key terms: use, search, computer, information, work, decide, know, think, look, investigate
  
  Explanation: The cluster revolves around the concept of utilizing computers for information-related tasks, emphasizing actions such as searching, working with data, decision-making, and knowledge acquisition.
  
  Scores:
     • Coherence: 4/5
     • Relevance: 5/5
     • Coverage: 3/5
  
  Strengths: Clear connection to technology domain, Focus on core concepts
  Weaknesses: Limited coverage of all cluster terms, Lacks explicit mention of specific actions like'search' and 'look'
  
  Justification: The explanation is coherent in its focus on computer usage for information tasks. It connects well to the technology domain by highlighting decision-making and knowledge acquisition. However, it could be more comprehensive by including terms like'search' and 'look' which are part of the cluster.
  
  Detailed analysis:
     • Extracted key phrases: 1. "computer search"
2. "information work"
3. "decide think"
     • Verification passed: True

----------------------------------------

CLUSTER 1:
  Key terms: february, july, june, year, tuesday, season, summer, weekday, scottish, electro - acoustic_transducer
  
  Explanation: The cluster revolves around the thematic concept of 'Seasonal Technology', focusing on specific months (February, July, June) and seasons (Summer), which are indicative of temporal aspects. The inclusion of 'Electro-acoustic Transducer' suggests an emphasis on technological devices that operate within these seasonal contexts.
  
  Scores:
     • Coherence: 4/5
     • Relevance: 3/5
     • Coverage: 4/5
  
  Strengths: Clear thematic focus, Logical clustering
  Weaknesses: Lack of explicit connections between terms, Limited domain relevance
  
  Justification: The explanation is coherent in its thematic focus on seasonal technology and electro-acoustic transducers. It connects well with the provided terms. However, it could be more precise in linking the terms to each other and the broader technology domain. The coverage is adequate, addressing the main aspects of the cluster.
  
  Detailed analysis:
     • Extracted key phrases: 1. "Seasonal Technology"
2. "Electro-Acoustic Transducer Usage"
     • Verification passed: False
