82359;"I bought this to remove tartar off my cats'teeth. Somewhere in the product information, or in my imagination, I thought this product was for Pet Teeth Not just for Dog Teeth. And though I am not a dyed in the wool dog lover, I wouldn't give this to a dog either. Here was my experience with this product:It came promptly. I still had some of my old tartar remover, so finished it off, then got a spanking clean cat bowl and put a few drops of the blue tartar remover in the bowl, then added clean water. Wow. The blue stuff foamed up in the bowl. Well, I had bottled water in the bowl, so I wanted to save some if possible. I poured half the blue foaming liquid out and refilled with water. Just a few bubbles appeared. So, since it was a clean bowl with bottled water, I put some of the water on my finger to taste it. No soapy taste, just a bit metallic. So I gave it to the cats. They drank a bit and wandered off. I estimate there were 2 drops in a pint of water.I also keep a bowl of water for them in the kitchen and it has NO tartar remover in it. Over a period of a week to 10 days, I noticed that the kitchen water had suddenly become a bigger hit than the water at the feeding station. Odd. I really wasn't paying too much attention UNTIL,I came in to refill the bowl at the feeding station and put in about a eighth of a teaspoon of the blue tartar remover.(So that is one eighth teaspoon in a pint of water.) It foamed up like mad. Suddenly, I realized the kitties were not drinking the blue foaming water, but were going into the kitchen to get pure water. I poured half the water out again, refilled the bowl at the feeding station and watched. Not a good video. Grey kitty smelled the light blue water, put his foot in it and walked to the kitchen. Brown Kitty woke up later and had some kibble. She drank about 2 laps of the treated water and headed for the kitchen.Cats will not eat or drink anything that is bad. If water is fresh, but in a puddle, yep they will drink it. If food has spoiled, no they will not eat it. I know they will drink anti freeze which kills them, but over all, they are quite discriminating in their tastes. I do not know exactly what turns them off about this blue foaming product, but they are having none of it. I ultimately threw my bottle away. I will not give it one star because I do not hate it, but I am certainly wary of it and will give no more to my kitties. This is definitely NOT a kitty product and I wouldn't give it to my dog either. Up to you and your dogs, but it surely does not Look right or pass the ""Kitty says its OK"" test. I vote against it.";0;"I bought this to remove tartar off my cats'teeth. Somewhere in the product information, or in my imagination, I thought this product was for Pet Teeth Not just for Dog Teeth.

13668;Love these for my power chewers! My 3 power chewers love these bones and they last about a month. All other bones get demolished within 48 hours. I have a Shar-Pei, a Coonhound, and a Brittainy Spaniel/Doberman/Border Collie Mix. These three dogs can chew through anything. The regular size is right for all of them, not too large and not so small that they cause a choking hazard. My little Bedlington Terrier likes these too. One of these would last him an eternity as he has a very soft bite. My dogs seem to like the chocolate (brown) flavored one the best of the three. I highly recommend these and they are much safer than rawhide.;0;Love these for my power chewers! My 3 power chewers love these bones and they last about a month.
