CLUSTER SUMMARY:
----------------------------------------

📋 CLUSTER 0:
  Key terms: quantity, nutriment, quality, substance, work, product, achiever, use, usage, time

  🎯 Explanation: The terms in this cluster are interconnected through the concept of 'quality' and its application in various contexts such as nutrient content, work output, and usage over time.

  📊 Scores:
     • Coherence: 4/5
     • Relevance: 3/5
     • Coverage: 4/5

  ✅ Strengths: Clear connection between terms based on the quality concept
  ⚠️ Weaknesses: Lack of specificity in explaining the application of quality in each context, moderate relevance to the technology domain

  💡 Justification: The explanation demonstrates a logical connection between the terms based on the concept of 'quality'. However, it could be more specific about how quality is applied in each context. The relevance to the technology domain is moderate since the terms are quite general and could apply to multiple fields. The coverage is good, addressing the main aspects of the cluster.

📋 CLUSTER 1:
  Key terms: cat, felid, dog, toy, canine, small_indefinite_amount

  🎯 Explanation: The cluster revolves around the concept of pets and their associated items, including animals from the Felidae family, dogs, toys, and small quantities of technology.

  📊 Scores:
     • Coherence: 4/5
     • Relevance: 3/5
     • Coverage: 4/5

  ✅ Strengths: Clear connection between terms, logical clustering
  ⚠️ Weaknesses: Limited domain relevance, potential for more specific technology references

  💡 Justification: The explanation is coherent in linking the terms to a common theme of pets and associated items. It connects well within the context of pet-related concepts. However, it could be more precise by specifying that the "small amount of technology" refers to pet tech or gadgets. The relevance to the technology domain is moderate since the focus is on pets rather than technology itself. The coverage is good, addressing the main aspects of the cluster.

     • Extracted key phrases:
       1. "Felid family"
       2. "Toy for canine"
