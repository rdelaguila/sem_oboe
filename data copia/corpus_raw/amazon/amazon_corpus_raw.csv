82359;"I bought this to remove tartar off my cats'teeth. Somewhere in the product information, or in my imagination, I thought this product was for Pet Teeth Not just for Dog Teeth. And though I am not a dyed in the wool dog lover, I wouldn't give this to a dog either. Here was my experience with this product:It came promptly. I still had some of my old tartar remover, so finished it off, then got a spanking clean cat bowl and put a few drops of the blue tartar remover in the bowl, then added clean water. Wow. The blue stuff foamed up in the bowl. Well, I had bottled water in the bowl, so I wanted to save some if possible. I poured half the blue foaming liquid out and refilled with water. Just a few bubbles appeared. So, since it was a clean bowl with bottled water, I put some of the water on my finger to taste it. No soapy taste, just a bit metallic. So I gave it to the cats. They drank a bit and wandered off. I estimate there were 2 drops in a pint of water.I also keep a bowl of water for them in the kitchen and it has NO tartar remover in it. Over a period of a week to 10 days, I noticed that the kitchen water had suddenly become a bigger hit than the water at the feeding station. Odd. I really wasn't paying too much attention UNTIL,I came in to refill the bowl at the feeding station and put in about a eighth of a teaspoon of the blue tartar remover.(So that is one eighth teaspoon in a pint of water.) It foamed up like mad. Suddenly, I realized the kitties were not drinking the blue foaming water, but were going into the kitchen to get pure water. I poured half the water out again, refilled the bowl at the feeding station and watched. Not a good video. Grey kitty smelled the light blue water, put his foot in it and walked to the kitchen. Brown Kitty woke up later and had some kibble. She drank about 2 laps of the treated water and headed for the kitchen.Cats will not eat or drink anything that is bad. If water is fresh, but in a puddle, yep they will drink it. If food has spoiled, no they will not eat it. I know they will drink anti freeze which kills them, but over all, they are quite discriminating in their tastes. I do not know exactly what turns them off about this blue foaming product, but they are having none of it. I ultimately threw my bottle away. I will not give it one star because I do not hate it, but I am certainly wary of it and will give no more to my kitties. This is definitely NOT a kitty product and I wouldn't give it to my dog either. Up to you and your dogs, but it surely does not Look right or pass the ""Kitty says its OK"" test. I vote against it.";0
51828;We have two of these now, indoors only.They allow our cats access to litter boxes in the cellar w/o having to leave the cellar door ajar.We've also installed one in our bedroom door so it can be kept closed, too.(We keep the temperature lower....and a/c'ed in the summer!)Good price for a great option!;0
17743;Easy to assemble, good size for my 1.5 inch Robo, no side door for escaping, cage bars are spaced tightly for safe keeping of mini animals, and very light to carry with a handle. Lots of possibilities for expansion with the fun-nel ports. My hamster loved it from the moment I put him in. I ended up buying another travel sized CritterTrail cage to put my new hamster in! Great cage and products!;0
112950;This does take off a ton of fur.  My German Shepherd does not like it too much though.  She loves to be brushed regularly with other brushes, but this one not so much.  She does allow me to use it, but I can sense her discomfort, and she isn't as eager to be brushed when she sees me holding it.  I'm not sure if it takes off too much hair like others say, but I can see why they would think it, and I have to admit, that I am a bit concerned myself.;0
143740;I'm so pleased with the Litter Genie.  It does everything it says it will do.  Since I have 4 cats I don't expect the bag refill to last as long.  It if lasts 3 or 4 weeks it will still be a great asset.  My pet sitter loves it too.;0
130116;Great bed particularly for the price. After my dog ruptured her ACL I needed something soft and supportive for her to hang out on. All of my dogs & cat love this bed and tend to just pile on.;0
106739;I have a small Cavalier and I bought this bag to travel with him for the first time (he's 8 mths).I liked the wheels on the bag because having a layover and lots of walking he was going to get too heavy.When I got the bag I used the same paper that came with the packaging to give it some shape (as it was folded, it had no shape and looked smaller than what it was) for a couple of days before traveling.My dog seemed pretty comfortable in it, he would scratch it a little every now and then (not enough if you ask me) by the time we got to our first stop he had broken the side he was scratching on (one of the sides with the clear-ish fabric. I had to figure out a way to keep him inside until we got to our destination. but this was really frustrating.Like I said he was in there scratching for 20 or so minutes total and then it was broken.I do like the fact that you can take the wheels off and my dog was overall pretty comfortable.Needs better quality. I had to go somewhere to get it back;0
6093;when fishes are being treated for parasites or diseases, their best chance of survival is if they continually eat. this does attrack them to fish food.;0
22977;Love the fact there isn't any stuffing in this toy.  My dogs haven't ripped it apart yet and still enjoy playing with it.;0
13668;Love these for my power chewers! My 3 power chewers love these bones and they last about a month. All other bones get demolished within 48 hours. I have a Shar-Pei, a Coonhound, and a Brittainy Spaniel/Doberman/Border Collie Mix. These three dogs can chew through anything. The regular size is right for all of them, not too large and not so small that they cause a choking hazard. My little Bedlington Terrier likes these too. One of these would last him an eternity as he has a very soft bite. My dogs seem to like the chocolate (brown) flavored one the best of the three. I highly recommend these and they are much safer than rawhide.;0
113436;I got this shampoo from another website before and I love it. The smell is really nice and it always leave dog's fur very smooth. I am happy to find it on amazon.;0
30568;Bought this for my 20lb tuxedo since he thinks he is always starving.  He played with it for a few min and then was over it.  However, if you have a young cat our kitten loved it. Was excited by the fact his toy dispensed big cat food vs his kitten chow.;0
108987;My Rabbit loves it, and this is one of the few products that I found that has no alfalfa hay in it;0
39070;Both of my cats go crazy for these. This is the second package...they're very hard on their toys! But I'm ok with that because it amuses them for hours.;0
91734;"Revised: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) Water sufficient for processing, fish, poultry, meat by-products, wheat gluten. How disgusting is that?! ""Fish"" and ""poultry""?? Not really sure how that can be counted as an ingredient...not ""tuna"" or ""salmon"" but ""fish."" Not ""chicken"" or ""turkey"" but ""poultry."" If it was a decent quality meat- they wouldn't feel the need to hide behind ambiguous terms. Then there's the by-product which is the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, pure, meat, and there just isn't real identifiable meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients, just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, dry foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or ambiguous ""meats"".";0
17241;I tried this and other products to clean the fur from furniture, upholstery and blankets at my shelter of cats, and it works, but not as good as other products.;0
24928;This collar is effective for both of my 25-lb mixed breeds who bark at all of the neighbors when they're out in the yard. For the next few days after wearing the collar, barking continues to be reduced or stops, then they start up again and I have to put the collar back on them.However, when batteries ran out they were impossible to find except here at Amazon and the ones I ordered don't all work. I replaced the battery in both collars and only one works - I'll have to start going through the rest of the 10-pack to see if the others work better.If the replacement batteries were easier to find and always worked, this collar would be ideal.;0
14376;"The ground just got higher!!  Knee problems have kept me from cleaning my yard of dog poop & I therefore just flung it around with my lawnmower. My 27"" pooper scooper has eliminated this problem. The product works wonderfully picking up poop large & small and emptying ""it"" into a plastic grocery bag, quickly and efficiently.";0
5923;My cat loves to carry them around and hide them under the sofa and bed.  Great stocking stuffer for cats.;0
138202;Ok for the price I suppose.  One of them still fed water back to the pump, making it useless.  Spend more for better units.;0
87398;Both our dogs love this bed. The little one gets in there more than our larger Great Pyrenees. They do like to get in there together on the colder days. Cover comes off for cleaning,though we have not washed it yet.;0
133921;"I received a used toy! It was scratched, cracked and very obviously far from being new. I actually don't know if my cats would have enjoyed the toy, or not. Unfortunately, just the smell of the toy, having already been ""broken in"" by other kitties, kept them from even trying out the toy. After the first smell, they never went near it again. In short, this was a very disappointing purchase. Wrapping a used item in new packaging does not make it new!(I did return the toy, and I immediately received an instant refund. I had absolutely no problems with the return process.)";0
94566;Great price for a pack of 3 clickers.  Nice button on top, easy to click, and the sound isn't quite as harsh as some others I've used.  The dogs have no problem hearing them, so I much prefer them.  Actually some of the louder, hard clickers actually frighten our small dog -- but she doesn't shy away from these.;0
114447;I probably would never have purchased a litter box this big had I seen it in the store, but my cats are really liking the larger size. A matched set would've been nice, but color wasn't a choice.;0
82300;And my bird loves it too.  It is one of the best maintenance bird diets out there.  Will continue to buy it if I can get it shipped for free.;0
105632;Works very well to clean up cat urine. No harsh chemical odor and no remaining traces of urine when using a black light.;0
46224;I have a male cat that has been harassing the females. I put one diffuser upstairs and one downstairs. Things have improved a lot. The chasing has subsided almost totally. Occasionally there is a little swatting and hissing, but the difference is amazing. I highly recommend this product.;0
145889;Our ACD loves this toy.  We fill it with her kibble and a few treats and it keeps her busy for 30 minutes at a time!;0
65404;This harness fits well but one of my two dogs does not like it much but I think with time she will get used to it. Measure correctly because the neck size is not adjustable;0
3964;Finally, something that works.  No more plastic, no more trying to thread screwed up threads.  Very satisfied customer;0
7215;Bought for my 8 week old chihuahua she ate it only for a short time before refusing it.  And it's is not grain free;0
25851;My cat rarely drinks from the faucet anymore!;0
137696;My dogs love greenies. I ordered these trying to save money instead of the Bright Bites that I had been getting. I think the Bright Bites might do a better job of cleaning the tarter off of their teeth though, and my dogs also love those. I will observe their teeth for a while on these more economical teeth cleaners and edit later if I think that it is indeed true that the Bright Bites do a better job of cleaning their teeth. They did have a better price online of some of the Bright Bites, but did not see the better deal as of late, so ordered these trying to save some money, about 1/3 the price of Bright Bites at the current price. We do brush their teeth every night and then give them these as a &#34,bribe&#34, for letting us brush their teeth. They are not crazy about getting their teeth brushed, but will submit to it because they know they are immediately getting a treat after having their teeth brushed. Just like little kids, my little dog girls!;0
58689;It fits nicely into Kong and keeps Dasher busy. However Dasher vomitted after eating it. Not sure whether he's not used to this new treat.;0
123553;Our dog has a lot of Kong products and he loves all of them, this ball is right up there with his classic Kong.  Bounces a little too so when we throw it and it hits something, he gets to chase it a little.;0
125144;This fuzzy rabbit is one of the dogs' favorite toys. They carry it around everywhere. Worth the price and highly recommended.;0
59356;I recently looked for supplements for my dog who has autoimmune arthropathy and came across this product and saw the good reviews. I decided to try it and am so glad I did. I had been using it for my dog for about six weeks now. My dog is more active and less withdrawn now and I didn't have to give her Rimadyl for at least 3 weeks (considering I was giving it twice a day at some point). How do I know this supplement works? I don't know. But what I do know is the difference I've seen in my dog before and after I put her on this supplement. I give it to her slowly as she lick the tip of the syringe. And please remember to REFRIGERATE just as an added precaution. I've forgotten twice to refrigerate right after using it but luckily, I realized it before it got warm so I really didn't worry about it.;0
81536;I am trying to train my dog and needed a longer lead for some of the procedures and this was ideal for what I was doing.;0
21353;it's bigger than his previous two hide-a-squirrels, so it is easier for him to get anything and everything out of it.Careful though, folks, my dog has a ball breaking the plastic inside the bottom of the toy into teeny tiny shards. When that happens, I have to cut open the bottom and pry out the pieces, which are VERY DANGEROUS if not removed and your dog gets at them.So if your dog is a tough chewer, as mine is, this toy will last quite a good while. Just be sure to extract the plastic shards (not a smart choice on the part of the manufacturer) after they are sliced and diced by your dog.;0
147050;I've been trying to use this for the last month or so, because lugging the big packages of litter was wearing me out. This stuff is indeed lighter weight, but in that process I feel the integrity of the liter has been compromised. It doesn't clump and is almost impossible to scoop an there is little odor control as well. I won't be buying this again.;0
100092;I gave this item five stars because it really meets my expectations. It claimed to help slow down a dog's eating, and it does. It also does not skid all over the floor. It is easy to clean.;0
126506;Kona has one of those pop-up cubes and absolutely loves that thing (it's basically falling apart after a few weeks though - he tends to jump on it) so we figured this would be just as fun and hopefully hold up better.He wasn't too interested at first but now he hides out in it and loves to drag his toys in there when he catches them.  The tube seems like it'll hold up well.;0
78927;This is an ok toy, it didn't last very long with my cat, who just tore it up and pulled all the fur and tail off the mouse, now its a squeaky plastic ball!;0
47832;my cats absolutely go CRAZY over this stuff!  I have little bells that I use to let them know it's 'treat' time and THEY COME RUNNING.;0
58786;I bought this patio pet door for my sliding glass door (which is a newer door).  I had measured like they request you do and it was to a T.  The door came in and it is too large for my door...won't fit my door.Very disappointed...seems like everything that I have gotten from AMAZON in the last 6 months has been either defective, scam, wrong sizes etc............................And...they are not getting my refunds back to me!;0
9802;My elderly long hair Birman can no longer groom because of arthritis so I've been brushing and combing out his tangles for about a year.  I was using a flea comb which needed to be replaced.  Bought this one and it works well on my old boy.  The handle is nice and large for a good comfortable grip.  The metal on the comb portion comes to dulled points so it won't poke your pet.  I am very gentle when working on getting the matted fur from my old cat and this one works well.I also have a short hair and this doesn't work particularly well on her because the teeth of the comb are not close enough together like my old flea comb.  I'll have to get another flea comb for the short hair.Overall, it's well made and me and my Birman really like it!;0
19397;Really like this product for it's durability and strength.  The cat liners are large and roomy to fit Momma Kitty's litter box and holds a lot of litter.  the draw-strings make for easy clean up.;0
68034;I used this for a short while with my senior dog who had various problems that required antibiotics.  But I've never liked the idea of feeding animals anything with &#34,animal digest&#34, in it, so I stopped recently and have been using a pre-biotic instead (Bene-Bac).  This is the product that most veterinarians sell, so it's certainly popular and not too pricey if you buy it with Amazon.;0
77026;I have a 35-40 pound hound puppy and this works well for her. She isn't one to run but we use this if we take her somewhere unfenced and unfamiliar. The only problem which is common with any run is that she sometimes gets a rash or a blister on her belly from it rubbing against her. Again, that's common with any run but you could invest in a trolley if you're concerned about that.;0
96397;This item shipped quickly.  It is the exact replacement of the original part.  I've had this for several years and as long as you clean it once a week (give or take), it works just fine.;0
28655;This is a nice big bag of pet bedding that I am using for a dwarf hamster in a medium sized cage.  It looks like there will be enough in the bag for approximately 10 cage cleanings, so it's a good big bag.  I put it about 2 inches thick and then let my little hamster go to town and arrange it however she wants.  She usually makes a big pile for sleep under.  She seems to like it and it seems to be odorless so this brand is definitely a keeper.;0
9178;I wish this type of airline hose was around 30 years ago when I was a kid.  It does not kink and it works well with all of my pumps and air stones.  Also, the blue color is a nice touch in a glo-light type of aquarium.;0
88417;We just moved and we have a kitty who started spraying in the house after seeing a cat outside. We didn't want our new house to be icky so we used this and it seemed to work. After a few weeks I took it off and then guess what, he sprayed in the house! I had to buy him another one and it seems to be working out really well. I like the smell of the collar, it isn't stinky at all.;0
52582;I use the littermaid for in my home, however I have a screened enclosure and this works great outside instead of my cats having to make a run for it in the house if they have to go. I put it outside in the screened area (they are not allowed outside other than here) and they can use it without me worrying about them having an accident out there. When I first purchased it I had it in my hall and it was empty so they used it as a hide and seek space, I almost think they were disappointed it became a litterbox..lol.. I have to agree with other reviewers who stated the palm was not enough on top but easy enough to go to the dollar tree/dollar store or use coupons for Micaels or Joann's to get another palm or plant to put in it. I am happy with my purchase.;0
136364;Cats prefer to drink from running water so I got this to put down in their water bowl. I would have liked to be able to clean it better, though if you were just using it for a fountain it probably would be okay. Its pretty powerful and i like the gliding switch so you can really have a range of flow;0
27541;The ball turned out to be a little  too big for my dog. But made a great Christmas present for a friend that had a dog. He just loves chasing it and the different sounds that it makes.;0
32005;I love all zukes products., I use this as a training treat and break it apart.  It's all natural., low in calorie and my yorkie loves it;0
134613;It's cute and the batteries last a while, and unless the dog has really dense fur it also helps give a beacon in the dark, which I thought was really cool (not what it was designed for, but I thought it was an extra plus).There's a red light that is motion activated to show you it's charged. I think this holds its charge pretty well.Things I've discovered through other dog owners since I've started using this, though: some people seem to have the misconception that this is going to train/stop your dog. It's not. It interrupts your dog from what he or she is doing, but you're still the one who has to provide the discipline. It'll interrupt your dog so you can get his or her attention, so you still have to reinforce the right behavior -jump in as soon as you've interrupted the dog with this.  This isn't a dog trainer, it just provides a little extra help.The other major concern I hear from other dog owners is that this thing might &#34,hurt&#34, their dog. Pfft. Yes, I strapped it to the inside of my elbow (yes, it's a sensitive spot), and gave it a couple pushes of the button.I learned a few things having tried this on myself:The first setting is basically a vibrate setting. If you ever played the Xbox, it's basically like your controller vibrating. The two metal knobs intensifies that a little bit -it'll scare your dog (heck, it gave me a start!), but it in no way hurts.  This will get your dog to go, &#34,OMGWTF!?&#34, for a split second, then you get your dogs attention and do what you have to.My dog adjusts very quickly and was able to start ignoring the first setting after a while.The second setting (the &#34,L&#34, button) is a shock. Don't worry about pushing the button or holding it down -this thing almost has cool down time built into it -it buzzes the dog (or you, if you're like me and want to tie this to yourself and try it out) for a fraction of a second, but doesn't keep doing it even if you hold the button down and you can't push the button fast enough for it to work like an electrocution device (but please, please don't take that as a challenge). So, this won't hurt your animal because it's not electrocuting your pet. If your pet adjusted to the vibrate setting like mine did, move on to this one. Again, buzz him, but jump in and reinforce the behavior you DO want. This only helps interrupt the animal from what he's doing, if you don't get in his space as soon as you can, his attention will go right back to what he was working on.The third setting -I'm assuming the &#34,H&#34, stands for high -doesn't actually feel any different than the &#34,L.&#34,  And yes, yours truly tried more than once to test the &#34,difference&#34, but couldn't feel one. After 4 shocks my forearm did feel kind of numb for the next 5 minutes, but this is not going to cause injury to a dog because, again, it's a small zap that lasts for a fraction of a second not electrocution (constant current). I know it's strange I have to reiterate that, but I've spoken to a handful of very concerned pet owners who believe this will actually fry your pet if you hold down or continuously press the button -that's not what this does (and hopefully not what any training aid is ever designed to do).That being said, if the &#34,L&#34, setting isn't dissuading your dog from what he or she is doing, the &#34,H&#34, setting isn't going to make a difference.;0
7669;Really like the quality of this pad which I got for my puppy.  It has held up after numerous washing & dryings.;0
75828;This little cup/bowl folds flat and can be easily slipped into a handbag, in the seat back pocket and even clipped to a bag or strap with the carabiner it comes with.  The bowl is sturdy enough when popped open and stays open securely at each fold/step.It can go in the dishwasher and is easy to clean. No more smelly hard to clean fabric bowls.  This is great for dogs who refuse to drink out of dark containers.One note of caution: if you have a dog that likes to splash in its water bowl, you may find that it may collapse the bowl spilling water all over the floor or even learn (& like!) how to collapse it (great! a new toy!).UPDATE: FEB 2011We are still using this cup daily since buying it in the summer of 2008 and so far it looks as new as the day we bought it. There is no visible wear. Excellent product!;0
114637;This is the second one I've bought. The other one lasted at least 10 years. I have cats and dogs. This little machine is so handy for anyone who has carpet. Well worth it in my opinion.;0
39933;Not sure why, but my dogs just do not destroy these type of toys.  We have a few different animals in this type toy.  A couple of them we have had for a few years.  Yes, they still play with them.  I had one for about 4 years and had to throw it out just because it was getting old and the material was getting dry.  I don't find the squeak as annoying as some other toys either.;0
123278;I asked my guinea pigs and they said give this 5 stars.  Everytime I get them one they go at it like a bunch of beavers and spend almost a year chewing the thing all up.;0
11666;Pabu doesn't play with these on their own, but I put them in with his Marshall ferret ball pit and suddenly they became so much more interesting. And you can't argue with the price either.;0
135684;I got my Chesapeake Bay Retriever puppy at 8 weeks. He absolutely LOVES this food! The only negative is my guy goes #2 alot on this food...not times a day per day but in the amount that comes out. His stools are normal looking I just wish they were smaller. I tried Fromm LBP but my guy would pick out the TOTW and leave the Fromm.;0
104781;You have to keep applying this OFTEN for it to make any difference. This isn't the universal cat problem answer that others have made it out to be. remember cats are individuals and if they wanna scratch they're gonna, whether it smells like kitty already or not.;0
49989;I keep encouraging my dog that she can figure it out...but just between us humans I think it might be too hard. If I hold it and she pulls the rope, she can do it. But without hands to hold the bottle upside down, I don't really get how a dog could do it. She was really frustrated and stressed about the whole ordeal.My boy dog wasn't so stressed, and very determined. He's not quite as bright as my girl...but he sure had the heart for it! I doubt he'll get it either.I just got it today so I'll give it more time but I just don't think it's feasible when all you've got to work with is paws and teeth.That being said, they liked using it with me holding it, hence the three stars. My girl figured out that if she made her brother do the tugging, she was more ready to snatch up the treats when they fell out. Told you she's the smart one.;0
93905;Dog Pet Grooming Shear Scissor SettMy wife and I own and occasionally breed toy poodles.  My wife does all the grooming most of the time.I thought that I'd surprise her with some new scissors.  When these arrived yesterday, she immediately scooped up one of the toy poodles and went to trimming.  She particularly likes the fact that you get four different size scissors in the set.  I did make the mistake of telling her how little they cost.  I should have kept my mouth shut.  They are comparable to much more expensive scissors in the cutlery shops.  With what grooming costs around here they paid for themselves yesterdIf you groom dogs with scissors, I highly recommend this set.  I , also boughtt Tiny Dog Grooming Scissors Trims Safely @ Ears~Eyes she likes thaose as well.Gunner, 2010;0
127261;I have an 10 month old boxer who can chew through most toys in a matter of seconds.  This one has been going strong since she was about 3 months old.  I find that most Kong chew toys stand up to a major chewer with the exception of any that have rope or stuffing.Well worth the expense considering lesser cost chews are generally less strong and resistant to a large dog's chewing.;0
41831;I have tried several products.  I like this one the best.  It seems to be fast and thoroughly removes the stain and odor..;0
88463;My order from Amazon arrived very quickly.My lab mix, medium-sized dog has trouble with large treats. These were tiny.When they arrived, I took one out and he sniffed at it very cautiously, then tried it. It passed his nose test and his mouth test.We're happy.EDITED to say that he has changed his mind. Now he prefers one size larger, but he still likes these.;0
59767;It was too small and did not collect the litter the way it stated.I would not recommend buying it.;0
123258;Have two small Yorkies with dental issues.  This was recommended by our vet.  Seems to help the breath and tarter issues.  Will keep purchasing this item.;0
56427;We have 4 dogs. We own 11 crates. 1 set upstairs. 1 set downstairs. A set to keep at our parents' house.We love Midwest crates/products. They have held up very well.I needed another crate for our latest furry addition.I purchased this one because it appeared to be the exact same model that we had purchased previously.When it arrived, however, it was apparent that it had been redesigned. The gauge of the crate is not as thick. In addition, instead of having two clips to keep the front/back up there is only 1. This is probably more than adequate as this crate will house an 8 year old pug who has no desire to escape. If I had an escape artist I would be more concerned.It will meet my needs. Might not meet everyones.;0
28055;My pup is potty training and I lay down pads for him to  use the rest room inside his playpen. These pads are able to absorb the wetness without leakage. Would recommend;0
86463;Works as intended, no slipping, no spinning, no dropping, holds multiple bags with no problem. The material quality makes me think this product should sell for $0.69, but the service it provides makes me happy to pay the $5 price.;0
145695;I started giving these to my solid black English Springer Spaniel who is a dander making machine. Ever since he started getting these regularly, his coat looks shinier and healthier, and his dander is under control. No longer do the other dogs in the neighborhood make fun of him and leave bottles of selsun blue in his food bowl. He's a very happy dog now and he seems to notice it too, because he isn't scratching or rubbing against things as much as before.;0

77762;My Cavalier King Charles Spaniel loves his Orka Flyer! He loves to chew, and he's had this toy for almost a year -- which we call &#34,the Blue,&#34, and he hasn't torn it yet.  Charley chewed through a hard plastic frisbee within an hour.I love that &#34,the Blue&#34, is soft and flexible and easy of Charley's teeth and gums, I can't see that a hard plastic frisbee would be as gentle.  I fold the blue and use it to speak to Charley (like a hand puppet). He's learned to do that, too!  We play fetch in the house with the Blue -- we call all Charley's Orka toys &#34,the Blue,&#34, and Charley knows the difference between his Orka toys and his other toys.Charley has several Orka toys and most of them have held up under Charley the Chewer!;0
2831;Bought after search for quality food fot catz with renal issues as ours refused to eat the prescription foods from vet's.  Initially they weren't thrilled, but I think it was more catitude than pallatability.  By second can they not only eating it up but demanding it.  Only time will tell if it is good for health issues, but in meantime weight loss is no longer an issue.;0
152521;This tool works better than any other I have tried for my dog.  The amount of hair that comes out is shocking.  He likes the feel of it also.;0
121557;There are lots of bowls out there that will circulate water in a pet's bowl. This is something that is more critical to a cat than to a dog because cats sometimes don't drink enough to prevent renal problems, but let's face it: Something good to drink is good for any mammal.There are a few problems with this device as a solution.1. I found it didn't stick flat to the bottom of the bowl very well. Most bowls have curved surfaces, and it seemed that no matter how I placed it, at least one suction cup didn't grip.2. If it's totally submerged, you really don't get the effect of rippling water that makes it more enticing to your pet, nor do you get any aeration, which should be part of a filtration system. You could put less water in a bowl so it wouldn't be submerged, but you'd need a very wide, shallow bowl. And then you're going to have evaporation issues.3. The filter is pretty darn small. Put this into regular service, and you'll be replacing a lot of filters, putting an end to any savings over the water circulating bowls like the Drinkwell or Petmate models.I wanted to like a water circulator for a pet that is less expensive than the fancy systems out there, but in this case, I don't think you even get what you pay for it. This might be better for a goldfish bowl, or something like that. And I can't help but imagine that a big, playful dog might even just snatch this thing out of the water like it was a chew toy!Another advantage a real fountain-type bowl system is that the power cord for the pump can be better hidden out of the way of curious pets. While it's only low-voltage, you still don't want your pet biting into the cord that's draped-over the edge of their water bowl.All in all, I'm glad this was a free model for review, and not something I spent good money on.;0
72790;I have two of these (in green), each affixed to the front of my two Husky's Red Dingo Dog Harnesses, Large, Green. Great for visibility where we walk... amongst plenty of traffic, cyclists and other pedestrians. Brightness is great and I have had no issues with malfunctions or premature shut-offs as suggested by other reviews. So far, so good. Very happy.;0
49464;The silver wooden slats slid up and down the legs. I had to glue them down to stay put (to look like the picture). Didn't feel like going through the hassle of a return for something so minor, but pretty shoddy nonetheless.;0
143720;"I didn't even know I NEEDED one of these till I got one. And I'll never do without it again. We have a 14 pound Egyptian Mau who, even for a cat, is a totally obsessive clean-nik.  He will remind me every other evening if I have been so neglectful as to have not thoroughly cleaned his litter box.  Even though he has a large Booda Dome like thisBooda Dome Cleanstep Cat Box, Titaniumall to himself, he wants it kept in perfectly raked, pristine condition.Being a servile underling to our lord and master, I was using plastic grocery bags to accomplish this, till I got the Litter Genie.  Here's what I like about it:1. It works something like an old-fashioned diaper pail, sitting ever-ready by the litter box.  When I need to use it, it's there.2. You ""load"" the Litter Genie by placing a plastic ring filled with double-layered bags inside the top.  By the second time you do this, you'll know exactly how.  I've only had to refill it once in the 3 months I've been using it (I empty once a week, on ""garbage night"").3. The double-walled bags REALLY make a difference in odor control.  No wafting odors, no ammonia smell.4. The opening at the top of the Litter Genie is a nice size & much easier to ""hit"" with a scoopful of litter than trying to hold a grocery bag open with one hand.5. Scoop the used litter into the top of the Litter Genie.  Then, slide out a little bar & the litter falls down into the bottom of the Litter Genie (into the bottom of your double-walled bag).  Push the bar back in & odors are sealed away.  Really.  The bar itself never touches the used litter, it's ""lined"" by the double-walled bag.6. On garbage night, I simply open up the Litter Genie, position the top of the used part of the bag into a built-in bag cutter, tie a knot, & throw it away.7. To deploy a fresh bag, just pull out about 8 or 10 more inches of the bag material, tie a knot in the bottom of it, close the lid & you're loaded and ready to go.  It's easier than it sounds : )8. The Litter Genie has a scoop holder (installed on the left or right side, your choice) AND its own scoop.9. The rounded corners of the outside make this an unobtrusive part of the room, it's not ""clunky"" looking at all.10. The Cat is Happy!Refills are a little on the expensive side, but worth it, in my book.  If you have family members with allergies (I do!), keeping the litter box as clean as possible can help quite a bit.  I also use a litter mat like this to help contain/reduce litter dust:Pruven P LTM 1824 T 18 by 24-Inch Litter Trap Mat,Tan. Highly recommended, one of my favorite finds of the year!";0
155005;Only thing is we found we had to put half his kibble in and let him work on that for 20 minutes.  Then we put in the rest.  This is just due to the amount that ideally fits in at one time.  You can put all of it in at once.  But that actually makes it easier for him to eat and finishes faster.  If you have time, place half or quarter of their food in and it takes them almost an hour to eat!;0
45691;I have a medium-sized rabbit in a large dog crate.  This little box comes with two plastic attachments that screw down between cage bars.  My dog crate bars were spaced too far apart to fit these attachments, but I just bent the bars with a pair of pliers wrapped in a rag.  Alternatively, I could have constructed a plate out of wood that would have had the same result.  This litter box fits nicely in the corner, and the rabbit uses it exclusively until it is full.  If I don't clean it in time, he will move on to blankets and stuff.  At first, I was putting the paper litter on top of the bars, but the rabbit would dig them out.  Then I started filling the bottom under the bars, and that kept the urine smell down until I could change the litter, but the crottel would pile up on top.  After experiencing both methods, I have decided that the best thing is to put four packed cups of paper litter in the bottom, which fills the bottom a third of the way up.  Then the urine is absorbed into the litter, and the crottel falls into the container.  The rabbit seems to like it, and I do is well.  Overall, it is a simple and efficient design, and if I ever have additional small animals in the future, I would buy this product again.;0
125535;I'm very picky with dog food for my little teacup Yorkie.. so I did the research and this quality food is filled with the good stuff and leaves the bas stuff out!;0
9061;I have had this for a month.It is pretty huge. My other is a long narrow one.This one is huge.I have a UV bulb in it, and wow does it reflect the light everywhere.Works great and takes the heat.;0
122347;Does exactly what I need done. Do not have to worry about getting cats food if I am not able to be home for a while.  Can change times and amount when I need to.;0
121508;I really like this little fountain.  You can choose what kind of bowl to use it in, and what speed and water level to use, so you can have as little or as much splashing noise as you want.  It does seem to have improved how much water the cats drink!I invested in the 40 refills carbon filter pack to go with it, and that seems to be working well also.;0
74282;My cat loves his chin scratched and will rub up against anything, including my hand, ipad, laptop, etc. I got this hoping he could occasionally scratch his own chin and leave me alone! Put it near his water bowl and he uses it a few times a week. It's a little loud but that could also be due to my wood floors/high ceilings loft.Other colors would be nice.;0
1739;"PLEASE read the first few main ingredients before buying the product. Do not look at how fancy the wordings look but look at the actual ingredients that your cats will eat. Most of these food contain-1 - Chicken By-Product Meal -- ""dry, ground, rendered clean parts of the chicken carcass.""2 - Whole Grain Corn -- grains = high carbs = fat.3 - Animal Fat (preserved with Mixed Tocopherols and Citric Acid) -- a tocopherol is pretty much a form of vitamin E.4 - Corn Gluten Meal -- that's a protein corn by-product, it's a little deficient in lysine, so it shouldn't be the only protein source, which it isn't. (Yes, your pet can digest it just fine).5 - Brewers Rice -- another by-product, leftovers from the milling process.Please consider Grain-fee food for your cat if you want it to live a longer life because grain-free obviously doesn't contain grains, leftover meats, and the price is almost the same as these cheap 'craps'.";0
138846;We use this with the Hagen Dogit Training Holder and it is amazing. We had purchased cheaper quality wee wee pads and our puppy's urine would soak right through it.  She was also able to easily tear it apart and it would just stink.  This pad has proven to be superior in quality.  It has better absorption abilities (in turns into a gel-like substance in the middle) and covers more surface area so we don't have puppy potty prints all over the house. These pads in conjunction with the wee wee pad holder is perfection.;0
118792;We received the boomerang yesterday and I've enclosed two pictures of my dog tearing it up. We received it yesterday around 3pm and those pictures were taken from this morning at 830am. This toy won't last long but my dog likes it. I won't buy it again but if your dog is an aggressive chewer like mine look into the west paw hurley chew toys. Those last a long time and my dog likes them as much as anything else.;0
73305;Not what I expected.  Cats shredded it in one day.  Many pulls and holes in the fabric after just one use.  Need something more durable.  Nice feel to fabric, and had high hopes...;0
39037;I bought this cage for my 7 week old male rats and had to cover it with mesh initially. Four months later they were big enough so that they could not fit through the 1 inch bar spacing. They do love this cage. I have a tshirt hung up across the cage (with safety pins, great idea as tshirts don't fray when chewed and washed) as a hammock in addition to many more along the top. The cage gives them plenty of space to dart around. Cleaning is a breeze as my boys are potty trained and they have towels lining each level that just get thrown in the wash. Part of green ramp did snap towards the bottom but that has been my only issue.;0
56372;"-edit- my pup now takes naps in this crate during the day. He ripped a hole in his bed so we threw it away (he never really used it much)  We were wondering where he went when we couldn't find him, and it turns out he sneaks his way into my room when I wasn't looking to sleep in this crate.When we adopted our dog we were told to get a crate of this size for my medium sized puppy (15 lbs) It was a long day and we had just gotten our puppy home after we we picked up our pup in the morning, took him to the groomers, and ate out for dinner. I set up the crate in less than 2 mins and placed a crate mat in that I bought seperately, and placed our pup in. He wined for a while, I took him out and we fell asleep on my bed. He is only in it for when no one is home, or for timeouts. I dont use the divider because he is almost at his full size. It locks well and is pretty sturdy for a pup that wines alot but doesn't tend to try to escape.You just need a 30"" crate mat to make it comfy. I love the double doors, I leave them open and sometimes my pup walks in, sniffs around and walks back out.";0
122858;I don't have much to say about this - which is good. It works great and the price is the best that I could find after looking around a lot.;0
140058;One of the things that turned me off about scoop litter was the need to make multiple trips a day down to the trash to throw the waste out. I recently decided to switch and saw this product at Petco (but purchased it on Amazon). I've had it for a couple of weeks now and love it! Not only can I not smell the waste, I am not having to bring it down every other day or leave the bags outside of the apartment until going down the next morning.I clean my boxes (2 cats, 2 boxes) twice a day, morning and night. The litter genie makes it convenient. The price of the refills are a tad over the top but, that said, the way I look at it is I am buying LESS cat litter and it kinda breaks even. Love love LOVE the Litter Genie Plus!;0
82753;Great product to help maintain your pets teeth after a dental procedure.  Dogs love, even my finicky little Pomeranian!  Arrived very quickly and at a price only amazon can offer!;0

50377;After years of dealing with an older Petsmate fountain that leaked every week or so, this one seems better designed and built. It's attractive and easy to set up and refill.Only problem is, only one of the two cats seems to have taken to it so far. Given that it has an open waterfall action, vs. water tricking down an inclined slope.Stay tuned.;0
24736;looks the same but does not perform the same as when I buy it from the vet;0
39291;I was trying to get some new toys for my shelter rescued cat, but she doesn't much care for these.  I guess it could just be her preference, I really don't have anything bad to say about the actual product.  It's certainly a good deal!;0
101184;Not sure if this product works, but my dog refuse to drink any water with this stuff in it. I've tried to use only a few drop, and she still won't drink it.;0
134412;I love this Litter Mat. It really does keep the litter from being strewn around the litter box. I just wish they had one just a bit narrower, I would buy a second one if they did. Buy it, you will like it.;0
43006;Conveniently packaged and inexpensive, these wipes start off as a great value. Add to that their very pleasant scent and no disagreement from my easily disagreeable chihuahua, and these are a perfect, quick, freshen-up when pets are lightly soiled or in need of a between-baths sprucing up.A single wipe leaves my teacup looking refreshed and smelling squeaky clean.;0
120672;I am starting by saying WOW! I have several cats at home and I am always buying stuff for them. When I received this product I was amazing by how simple this concept is, but don't be fooled its simplicity makes it flawless, my cats love it the second I used it on them. It does feel like a cat tongue and you can tell by the way they behave when you use it (trying to simulate the movements of a mother washing the kittens)I have a 1 year old one who has been a little apart lately, not that friendly so I decided to use it with him, 1 minute later he was all over me and purring! so amazing I do recommend this product, packaging and materials are great and this company rocks as well, great CS...Enjoy!;0
2241;Only had to use this for 3 months and our dogs were cleared away! We do not usually have fleas by us so this got rid of them quick enough!;0
111873;My dogs love these...but they are from China and there is chicken in them. So I am a bit concerned if they would harm the pups.;0
62398;I've owned this heater for almost 2 months now. I'm using it in a 5 gallon acrylic tank and it consistently keeps the temperature at the level I set it to. No fluctuations in temps at all. It seems to be very accurate and hasn't given me any problems so far.;0
22865;I wasn't sure this would fit my kennel due to the brand difference, but I had no issues with it. Easy fix to a broken kennel floor.;0
9418;great to use with the pump on my 75 gallon tank.  helps to keep the water clear, I have some goldfish and they can be messy..good value for the price;0
148031;This is a very sturdy collar.  Please, collar makers...make two metal loops so we can put the ID on one and leash on the other!;0
149594;My dogs have always been fed a higher quality food so when they stopped eating their expensive food, I was panicked until I found this food.  They honestly sit at the bar and wait for the five minutes rehydration time.  I've never seen them so excited over any food before so this is a real winner.  One of my dogs has always drank a lot of water with feeding dry kibble.  I've noticed she doesn't drink 1/4 of the water with this rehydrated food.  I think this really is a wonderful food.  I'm going to monitor skin coat and weight but given they're jumping and running around, I think the verdict is in that this is a great tasting food.;0
52211;My boxspring/mattress/frame make my bed much higher then it use to be back in the day, I needed something to allow my pups(Chorkies) to get off the bed without having to jump from that hieght if they needed to. After much research on similiar products, Pet Gear III seemed to be the most purchased and enjoyed by dog owners. Yes I read there were difficulties in assembly and dogs not wanting to use it but I took the chance.1)The product is very sturdy and would trust my 90lb dog to use it.2)The stairs are wide which allows for a small breed puppy to come down one stair at a time and allowing his whole body to fit on the stair itself before taking the next stair down. There is a tilt to the stairs which a pup may feel is wierd but mine got over this real fast.3)Training, yes this could be an issue for some and one puppy went up and down it like it was nothing, my other puppy would not come back up the stairs. I felt as long as my puppies would go down the stairs they could bark to be brought back up on the bed, the safety issue was getting down off the bed not getting back up. She finally came up herself when one day her brother and I were up on the bed having fun and figured out I was not coming to pick her up.4)I blocked the one side of the stairs with a desk chair so that they would feel less intimidated by openess of the stairs since there are no sides which could make a stair using dog reluctant.(remember most stairs have a side since they are part of a wall)5)The best way to train a puppy to use stairs, is you do not start at the top(Lay at the top yourself and look down), you start at the bottom and get them to come down that first single stair then you slowly travel upward. I do not use treats for this, just leave them on that bottom stairs and gently call and slowly walk away, they are not going to want to stay there and miss all the action. If you have to play with a toy in the hall to get them interested in you and off the issue of the scary stair then do it. When you get to a high part you stay below them on the lower stairs to make sure they do not attempt to rush down the stairs possible injuring themselves(esp for people with hardwood stairs) and I always have a rug at the bottom with a non-skid bottom. Going up stairs is always easier then coming down..6)I would recommend these stairs, they are a life saver for my pups in preventing injury and future joint problems.;0
35087;"I have an Australian Cattle Dog who, like most ACD's, tends to fixate on things . . . in the case of toys, this means destroying them as quickly and as thoroughly as possible (and then looking disconsolate because he has no toy). When I first put this down for him (with one of the everlast treats it came with), he wasn't particularly interested (though he did get anxious when the cats went near it, so clearly it was on his mind). But eventually he got into it. He worked the treat out pretty quickly and ate it with gusto. So I moved on to treats on the inside (a little jerky and some liver biscotti), it doesn't take him long to get them out, but he sure enjoys it. He's also getting a kick out of playing with it and chewing on it even now that it's empty. So far it's holding up, but I worry about those little flaps for treat entry, I can't imagine they're long for this world with his obsessive chewing. Frankly, I don't expect it to ""everlast"" -- but he's so happy in the meantime that I'm okay with it.";0
62843;The single star does not necessarily mean we do not like the product.  It's just that we've been waiting for over a month for the product to ship.  Evidently the manufacturer is experiencing difficulties.  We will be using this for our Drinkwell 360 pet water filter.  I tired of having to buy prepackaged filters, so I ordered a refillable one.  They supplied me with a small tube of carbon.  I'm now out and need the replacement carbon!!!;0

52707;I adopted a small &#34,chiweenie&#34, type dog, abandoned in my neighborhood, wandering around  homelessthis summer, very cute dog.  She LOVES this toy!!!  Packs it around with her all the time,even tries to take it outside with her, she shakes it like crazy!If I squeak it, she goes nuts.  I would recommend this toy.  She doesn't seem to be a heavy dutychewer, so it is lasting quite well.  I got several similar toys like this to give her in the coming days,I am sure she will love them as much as this one.  I could see if your dog was a chewer, it might notlast long, but, for maybe supervised play, it could be OK, and then put away safe until you havetime for more supervised play with your dog.  I even named my new dog Zany because she goesso nuts for this toy!;0
10828;We have 3 Maine Coon cats who have always loved their jumbo-sized Booda dome litter boxes (the kind with the internal ramp).  They are so good at being 'urinally responsible', and this ramp fits nicely into those exit areas.  It seems counter-intuitive that the mat slants downwards towards the box, but the litter tracked out is far less than the flat mats we'd bought elsewhere.  It takes some quick carefulness to lift up the box and dump the excess litter into the box while scooping or changing it out, but I felt that this is doing a great job keeping the daily mess off of the rest of the floor.;0
103910;My cat likes sleeping in high places, so I thought she might like this product.  After adopting a new dog recently, I wanted somewhere for her to be able to go that was safely out of the way from the pup.  My cat likes to hang out in the office with me and my husband when we are both online, but there aren't too many hiding places for her there.  We thought this product would allow her an escape, whilst still enabling her to be in the room with us and feel safe from the puppy.My husband assembled this product within about 30 minutes.  His only complaint was that he'd have liked more detailed (written) instructions instead of just the images.  But once we got the base set up, this product turned out to be very easy and quick to put together.It is very sturdy, and I was impressed by how good it looks.  It doesn't look like too much of an eyesore in the corner of the room, for which I am glad.  I'm not too sure yet what my cat thinks to it - we've caught her rubbing her face against the platforms and even grooming herself whilst sat on the higher platorms, but she still prefers to sleep in the closet of the spare room!  I think she does like it , but it is far from her favorite place to hang out.  Maybe she'll warm to it in time.;0
104166;I bought this in November 2012. It worked fine and had zero problems with it. Never had it on while I was cleaning and always had it above the minimum line. Kept water at the right temperature if I turned it up a little bit more on the dial.Here's what instantly gave this a 1 out of 5...I came home from work today and noticed the temperature was below what I keep it at. The green light is on, but obviously it's wrong. I go to check it out and the second I put my hand in the water I get an instant shock. I quickly unplug the heater, Pull it out, and grab my turtle out of the water. He was swimming around at the time. To make sure it was the heater and not the socket, I plug it into a different outlet and test the water. It drew an electric charge. This is going right in the garbage. I'm pissed off that my pet was in danger this way. He seems to be doing ok and hopefully so. I've never had a heater give off electricity in a tank. Usually, it just stops working. I already contacted Aqueon and waiting to hear back. I WILL NOT be buying from them again!;0

46676;I love the JW dog toys since they are so durable and seem to last much longer than the other dog toys.  My Doxie is a chewer and loves to pull stuffing and squeakers out of every toy he has.  These toys hold up to his chewing.  This turtle toy does a crazy bounce when you throw it so it makes chasing the toy much more fun for my dog.;0
68203;I have a GSD who suffers from EPI.  This product was recommended on from a listserve that I belong to and has been perfect - my dog loves it and now doesn't feel neglected when my other dogs get treats!;0
85029;So, as you can tell from my title, I really like this toy.  It is well made, the seams are strong, and the fabric is thick and tough.  I've purchased theColeman Pterodactyl Dino Dog Toyas well and I can say without a doubt that Coleman toys are the best stuffed dog toys on the market today.  Both toys have withstood abuse that other, cheaper toys fall apart to.My dog still hasn't ripped the stuffing out of this goose after two weeks.  It's holding up well, and you can be sure that I will be buying more Coleman toys for her in the future.;0
62551;This is overkill and high priced.  Buy the adapter for your sink separately and a hose that is the right length for you on here or at a home improvement store.  I am using the adapter and a hose I already had. The one that came with this was very long.  You can also cut it to length.;0

He consumes them like a fine cigar after dinner. No matter what time of day I give these to him, he stores them to be savored later.Only problem is he hides them under the covers at the foot of my bed. So each evening we both jockey for position to kick back and relax. If my feet get too close to his stash, he growls. I'll continue to buy him Milk Bones as long as the price is right AND I'm allowed to rest peacefully in MY bed!;0
57215;I started a young dog with no hip socket on these chews when I inherited her.  She was on an anti-inflamatory and scheduled for hip replacement surgery.  I held off on the surgery and fed her the chews.  Lo and behold, my dog went from non-weight bearing to running on her hip.  I weaned her off of the anti-inflamatory and have been a convert to using the chews ever since.  This product is fabulous and the dogs love it.  Sometimes the chews are harder than at other times, but the dogs eat them as a treat and so they don't really care.  Something the dogs love to eat--AND--it's good for them.  I have every dog in my house on these chews from puppyhood.;0
20446;Keeps the dog under control without much effort.  Thank goodness for this addition in our dogs life.  It is now fun to walk her again as she isn't pulling like crazy.;0
142545;My ferret absolutely loves the ball pit.  But I must say that we have now added 5 packs of balls and it doesn't even come close to filling the pit.  We did however find these at Petco for 6.99 a package if you want to save a few dollars and buy more.;0
65247;The cats love this brand.  I get it for them occasionally as a treat, or if I cannot find a brand I prefer more.  The trouble with Fancy Feast is that the cats are very stinky when they use the litterbox.  VERY STINKY.  EYE WATERING.;0
122378;Well I can't say it is meowtastic, but it was alright. They kitties thought it was pretty cool as soon as we opened the package but after two weeks or so they could care less.;0
42573;this is especially helpful to have for toy breed dogs, puppies, and even low energy dogs that need a nutritional boost or appetite enticement.;0
94362;I have had this little cage for a couple of years, and it has actually weathered all kinds of storms.  I would suggest putting it away if there are going to extended periods where it is not used, and it is easy to open and close.  It just pops open.  Be sure to stake it down well or it can blow off.  Mine has gone across the yard in a strong wind a couple of times, but it endured the beating.  My cats love love love it.  They go to the back door and beg for me to take them to it.  Please do not leave them in the cage unattended though.  One of my cats jumped up and hung from the net and actually collapsed it on herself, which was quite unnerving for her.  It is really a great product.  Love it!;0
77493;My dogs really like the Rachael Ray line of Nutrish dog food, and it is exteremely difficult to find in my local area.  It comes in a variety of flavors, but chicken is their favorite. I like that it does not have meal and by-product as the primary ingredient. The only issue I have is that I have three dogs of varying size - the littlest one cannot manage to eat this food since she is only 4 pounds. My largest scarfs this down like it is filet mignon!;0
142916;Perfect for my Miniature Poodle.  From the description, I was concerned it would be too big, but it is not.  I will put it in his backpack, give the crazy pup a job!;0
50610;I was sick of replacing my Littermaids every year and a half or so when they broke so I decided to purchase a Litter Robot.  It was such an improvement over the Littermaid.  Litter isn't wasted, the waste doesn't stick to the inside of the globe, and very little maintenance is required.  With two cats, I only had to change the bag once a week, if that.  You can just set it up and let it go.  It was also wonderful not to have buy special receptacles.  You can just use your typical kitchen trash bags.But, although my cats seemed to initially adapt to it well, one of them soon decided he didn't like it.  I have two cats, a 7-pound Siamese, and a 21-pound Ragdoll.  I was aware that the Ragdoll might be too large to use it, although I had read that other large cats of a similar size were using it fine.  Anyway, although he used it fine at first, he began to develop a problem where he would enter the globe, not turn around, and proceed to pee and poop all over the outside of the box.  After a few days of that, he gave up going in the box all together and started going in front of the box.  I tried everything I could to get him to go in and turn around as he had in the beginning, but it was to no avail.  I really think his size made it uncomfortable for him to maneuver inside the globe.So with a heavy heart, I sent the Litter Robot back.  I think it is a wonderful litterbox and worth the cost, but if you have a large or stupid cat (as mine is both), be prepared to send it back if your cat can't or won't turn around inside the globe.;0
46042;I love the size of this litter pan.  I have a rather long cat and other boxes just weren't big enough for him to move around in.  This has solved this problem.  I don't really care for the storage on the end - but it's not a deal breaker.;0
32253;It secure and safe. I wish it was more durable on the zippers. Mine already came off I had to sew it back on but its still great. I love to put my JRT puppy in this. I would buy it again.;0
139770;Works perfectly never realized how much my animals went in the house *angry face* but it aided in cleaning up to prevent future accidents.;0
2575;I tried a small size bag purchased at the market and the way my two dogs loved the product I knew I needed a large bag.  It was a pleasure to have it delivered.  I and the dogs recommend it highly.;0
25050;"Let me first say I own a golden retriever and two persian cats.  So as you can imagine shedding was an issue in my house.  I was fortunate to find my golden when he was 9 months old. When we first took him home after being ""dog less"" for two years, I couldn't believe how much he shed.  Simply petting him lightly produced fur everywhere.  I had heard about the Linatone supplement but was a bit hesitant.  Well, I took the plunge and tried it out.  After about four weeks my dogs coat was so soft and shiny it was just amazing.  WIth those results I decided to try it with the cats as well.  Same result just beautiful.  So the Linatone along with the ""Furminator"" grooming tool are a sure winner.  I couldn't be happier with both.  So if your like me an love your pets but also love a clean house, these products are for you.SincerelyCheryl";0
3177;Definitely like ordering this on subscribe and save and not having to worry about running out or picking it up at the pet store.  Good food that did seem to cut down significantly on the hair ball episodes.;0
127242;My dogs LOVE these. I had bought a smaller one in January and decided to go with a bigger size this time. I figured the smaller one is still going after 6 months so the bigger one should last years. My dogs chew on this everyday and barely make a dent. It keeps them occupied for hours and is definitely worth the money!!!;0
4654;Got this because of the near perfect reviews.  I was disappointed.  The only good thing I can say about this product is that it is very quiet.  I wanted to cut down on clutter and reduce the amount of air pumps on my 5 tanks.  Figured I could run numerous air stones and bubble wands off of this.  It can run one bubble wand or air stone fantastically.  It will run 2 ok with a noted reduction in bubbles.  Add any more than that and the bubbles are reduced to a mere trickle.  I set this up 2 different ways to see it was my set up or the item.  First try was with gang valves.  Second try was with all hoses connected with connector tee's.  Same problem with both set ups.  So, sadly, this item is being used on a single bubble wand.  I am now using another brand of pump instead of this to run 8 air stones in 4 separate tanks with no problem at all.;0
57376;My 76 year old mother is the &#34,compassionate cat lady.&#34,  People dump cats on her all the time.  The latest cat prefers pooping on the kitchen counter....mental note....invite Granny over in lieu of eating at her house..  I got her this for Mother's Day.  Worked like a charm.  It doesn't always go off immediately but well worth the money.  Thanks!;0
59855;I bought two, one works well for one dog that eats normally.My other dog eats fast and enthusiastically, and so pushes into her dish while eating. The dish still gets pushed across the mat and into the wall, but it moves less than when placed directly on the floor tiles.But it does save the floor and grout from food spills, which is a good thing.;0
67315;I love this bag! My cat likes it a lot more than her plastic carrier even though it's smaller. It (the size large) fits perfect for Alitalia's travel guidelines and the other airlines we travel with (Lufthansa and Air Canada). When I take her to the vet she no longer cries and she likes that she can see through all sides. I like that I can open a small hole on the side and pet her to reassure her without risk of her escaping. It's also stylish, a lady asked me where I found it because she wanted one too. I suggest expanding to Italy, there is nothing like this available here! Oh, also the sherpa insert is really nice and my cat likes it too. The seat belt holders are also very convenient for car travel, overall a great product!;0
21905;I bought the medium size for my Yorkie-Poo since being a Yorkie, he is an avid chewer and nothing lasts for him except Kong type toys.  This toy lasted one month.  I took it away after the food was dispensed, which took him only 5 minutes no matter how tight I closed it, so he couldn't chew it up.  But just from chewing on it to get the food dispensed, bits and pieces started coming off.  Good concept, just dispenses food too quickly and product not tough enough.;0
157156;My boxer/lab mix is a chewer....she loves these things, both flavors.  They are loud if you have tile or hardwood but it's worth the occasional crash if your Telfenhunde spends hours just gnawing away at that and not your shoes, furniture, etc.;0
34114;My bunny loves this!  She is very busily and happily working on chewing her way from one end to the other.Bunn Fun !;0
35802;These are perfect for low wattage low heat in a protected thin fleece cover.  But I was disappointed that they only last about a year.  I do not like disposable products and will not buy again.;0
84764;Just ordered 4 of these collars for ONE cat. My other cats don't mind the breakaway collars and have worn the same ones for months or years! My one year old cat lost 5 breakaway collars in two weeks,(I know she is snagging them off on purpose!) which is when I searched for this type of collar. Found a kitten sized Elastacat collar locally which she wore for several months before losing so I am getting her the full sized collar and hope there is enough extra length to secure it under the buckle tab to keep her in it longer. These are inexpensive enough that if she wears it for 6-8 weeks I'll be satisfied. I purchased in orange.;0
153848;Feeding my Yorkie grain free is a must because of her allergies. I ordered Hills Science Diet Adult Grain Free Dog Food because it looked good as far as nutition and I like to switch every so often because she seems to get bored with the same thing. She is also a picky eater but she loved this stuff! I also love that the bites are small. I would deffinitely recommend this dog food!;0
89628;I purchased this gate to set up a new pen area for my pet rabbits. The narrow bars and vertical slots in this pen are great at preventing bunnies from ramming their heads through the slots and getting them stuck... bunnies are stupid.The gate has a panel with a door that opens. So you don't have to high step over every time and faceplant on your previously happy pet.The gate assembles very quickly and easily with one person.;0
84169;I tried everything else to keep the crows out of the suet.  This works.  Crows or blackbirds DO NOT like to hang upside down so take the bottom removable plug out and the woodpeckers and blue jays will eat.;0
107834;My African Grey loves this toy! It's destroyed happily quite quickly.  The only problem is that the chain/hook contains zinc!  I simply replace the chain and manually re-rope the thimbles.  The rope and thimbles are perfectly safe though.Always test anything metal with a magnet.  If the magnet connects, then the item is deadly to your parrot and needs to be replaced with a stainless steel version of the metal part!!!!  Many parrots die from lead and zinc!!!It is true that a magnet will connect to stainless steel. However, with lead and zinc based metals, the magnet connection will be much stronger than with a stainless steel material. Iron is also magnetic but covered with non-toxic paint makes it safe for birds. It is better to be safe than sorry since the zinc/lead issue is a huge silent killer with pet birds that many people are unaware of.;0
136475;Great utility bag.  We obviously use it for dog training.  Lots of pockets, water resistant, easy to use.  Pretty much indispensable for Obedience School.;0
47256;I've heard great things about this stuff. Frankly, I think its active ingredients, those of Nature's Miracle, and of Bac-Out, are probably the same. It's just a matter of which one's residual scent you like best.It's really hard to get the smell of cat pee out, because you have to get the enzyme liquid to all of the same places where there was pee, or the scent will persist. I think this stuff did a pretty good job of getting rid of the smell in places where I got the liquid, but I don't think I did a good enough job of really saturating the whole area.I'll probably buy it again.;0
148317;After having gone through multiple dog beds over the years, eko has created a wonderful winning pet bed cover and liner. It's machine washable, comes with a cute paw print cover and liner. The zipper access makes it easy for the owner to fill the bed with old clothes, blankets, towels, pillows, foam, cedar chips --whatever you might want for your dog or puppy. This one was Medium Round approx. 34 inches.  Having tried to wash many of the bulky pet bed liners in the past, this one is great because you can take it apart and wash all parts throughly.Here's the true test, I filled it and put it on the floor and my puppy crawled onto it immediately and started chewing on his toys. &#128062,;0
78132;The dog really loved these bones and it seemed to freshen her breath.  It was a good treat for a dog with tummy troubles.;0
116365;This toy I imagine will last forever.  I bought two because my Golden chews and chews through toys very easily, but this one seems indestructible.  I put small treats or peanut butter inside it.;0
5242;I have been buying these for years for my dogs (including Olde English Bulldogges, Mastiff, Lab mixes) and they love them.  They last for months and I never had an issue with broken pieces or my dogs choking on them like other chew bones.;0
47849;I have 2 cats.  One is of the garbage disposal variety. She will eat anything. Even inedible things that she later spits out. They other is finicky. Extremely so. In the years they have been getting treats, this is the only one that gets an equal reaction from both. They *love* the Bonito flakes. I don't feed them to them daily, but they are the occasional treat.I have them in a high cabinet, as I know they would get to them on their own if they could. This is exactly what I think a treat should be, heathy, light and something special.;0
145885;I was surprised when I read the reviews that didn't include the American Kennel Club Booster seat--or maybe no one gave a review for it. I think it is exceptionally well made. Very nicely done. The sides are solid and some of the others are net, but this is so much sturdier. It has a really nice covered pad in the bottom of the seat. My little girl dog is learning to ride in it. The seat has been a big help as our dog is a Rescue dog and was so afraid of even riding in the car. But the seat made her feel secure--and now she is beginning to enjoy riding in it. We take short trips every month or so and it's important that she be happy and comfy. And she is. I think this seat is a good value, and after all, the American Kennel Club should know what type of a seat would make a dog happy! It has easy to follow instructions on how to put it on the seat of the car--no problem. When not in use it folds up out of the way. The seat was delivered ahead of the time it was supposed to be, which was really nice. The box was very sturdy and secure. I would definitely recommend this booster seat! I really like it. (So does my little dog!);0
102102;The reviews for this were great but I was a little disappointed after I got this.  I thought the intent was for this to stand up and wobble back and forth (still vertical).  Instead, as soon as my dog(s) push the toy, it falls over on its side and just rolls around, staying mostly horizontal.  I understand this would happen if you try to completely fill it up, but even with the recommended amount of one cup, it still just falls over on its side with a single push.  It's not particularly challenging for them (the hole is pretty big) and definitely doesn't keep them occupied for long.The only time I've seen it working properly was when I was dog-sitting a small dog (pomeranian) and fed her dinner in this.  I have the size Large, for my med-large dogs and this is almost half the size of the pom.  When the little dog used it to dispense her food, it actually did what it's advertised for.  The Large size will definitely keep a small dog busy for awhile, assuming the dog is not afraid of it and is used to food dispensing toys.;0
47036;Best in dog kennel ever!!Proa. not metalb. easily collapsiblec. quickly can be moved out of the way if someone needs to use the seatsd. Fits the length of my Dodge Durango middle rowe. Width is greatf. everyone who sees it loves it and thinks it is amazing.g. Color and design is classy and modern. Not a typical dog kennel/cageh. easy to clean/wipe down (my 9 wk puppy has gone potty in it...material is solid so nothing leaks thru but easy to wipe up any messes)I. great to store packages, groceries, etc in if the dogs are not using it....people on the outside of car cannot see into it when zipped upj. zippers on both sides, so you can enter/exist from either side of the carCon--nothing that would prevent me from buying again or recommending. this is awesomea.  If you want to use it in a reduced length, you have to figure out how to strap it down in that size....either they did not send me all the straps or they just do not provide them. I bought a couple bungee cords and luggage straps from Home Depot and that works. But it would be great if them include one extra strap and hook on the actual body of the tube to make the shorter length easier to useNeutrala. Ppl complain about not being able to see into it. It is OK and not as bad as some reviews make it out to be. When you look into it from the drivers seat, you an see into it and see the dog's shadow, but you can at least see in it. I think dogs can see better than us, so they are OK. (I personally think it has value in that outsiders cannot see well into it)b. height - might be nice if it were 'taller'...my 6 month old Rottweiler fully stands up in it and hits the top. It would be nice if it was taller.;0
144732;I have a 40lb Australian Shepherd mix.  She loves all types of Nylabone durachew bones.  I don't understand why she'll often pass up a &#34,real&#34, bone for a plastic one, but she loves them and that's all that matters.  It's getting to the point that when she sees me bring an Amazon box in from the mail she expects it to be for her!  No, she's not spoiled :);0
118775;Pretty expensive for something that lasted a year. This is my second, my first lasted about 10 years. Quality has gone downhill. I bought an omega paw rolling cat box its manuel but works better than the littermaid and a lot cheaper. 35 bucks. would not buy another littermaid.;0
73808;I bought this on sale at Target thinking my cat would really like it. She loooves catnip, and goes crazy over it usually. But I practically soaked her cat tree in the spray and she is sound asleep on it as I write this! The catnip smell is not super strong, I can sort of smell it, but it doesn't linger long. It's only 0.15% catnip oil (didn't notice this til after I got it of course, haha), which doesn't seem like very much for 7oz.  :/  For the $2 I spent I think it was worth it, but some more concentrated stuff would definitely be better! You have to time the spraying just right, so that it is dry by the time your cat wants to play, but not wait so long that the scent is gone. A little frustrating!;0
17498;I just replaced my old sherpa carriers. I have two dogs that travel well in the Sherpas. They can look out through  the mess, have a soft pad and the dogs jump right in. I have a 3rd dog that is a chewer, so the Sherpa isn't a good choice. They have a zippered opening at the end or at the top, plus a zippered compartment at the back for leashes, bags, etc. They aren't overly bulky, the sides give so the dog can turn around in the carrier. The first two carriers lasted 7 years and were used frequently. They actually were still intact but they were accidentally sprayed with cleaner at the kennel and the zippers were difficult to unzip (best to take your carriers home with you rather than leave them with the kennel). Price is excellent on Amazon - I spent about $20 more when I purchased these years ago. I have one dog that is 20lbs (standard doxie) and one that is 14lbs and they fit a large.;0
55650;I use it as toothpaste on Henry's toothbrush, so I believe it works in that regard, but I've never used it just by itself without brushing so can't speak for that.  I wish it came in a pump or easier to squeeze bottle.;0
93437;my yorkies love these I give them to them in the evening and it keeps them busy for a long time;0
14504;I absolutely like this rake scooper but I have a maltepoo(toy dog) and he poops like a cat. Therefore, when i pick up his poop, sometimes his small poop falls between the metal prongs spacing making it difficult to pick it up and sometimes i had no problems. Unfortunately, I had to buy the pan/rake pooper which is working out for me much better. I recommend this if you got dog that makes big poops.;0
103160;Does the job but I could find a lot better quality for the same price.  The edges aren't sewn up very cleanly, and it keeps the crease in the middle.  Slips on the floor, I'd rather have it with a rubbery back so that it doesn't slide when the puppy is on it.;0
80737;These small doggy dish bowls are perfect, just enough weight to make them easy to handle, not like those lightweight ones in the stores.;0
36186;This harness has made all the difference in the world for us.  Our dog used to pull our arms out of our sockets trying to catch squirrels, rabbits, etc. while on a walk.  The very first time we used this, it was like a night and day difference.  She no longer pulls.  I mean you can tell she is excited about the squirrel and pulls a wee bit but it is SOOOOOO much easier to keep her under control.  The money I spent on this harness was well worth it.  We are very happy with this purchase.;0
122673;My Cherry-Head Conure chews on them somewhat, then plays with them by throwing them off the top of his cage a hundred times a day! So we both get exercise, since I keep picking them up!;0
98488;The design of it is flawless and all. Light-weight. &#34,Grass&#34, is removable. Whole thing is washable. Just the dog NEVER uses it. Not my dog, or my Mom's dog or the neighbor's dog. I've loaned this thing out to every pet owner friend I have and the dog always ignores it. I've tried placing it where the pet usually has an accident, I've tried sprays that are supposed to attract the dog. Never any success. On an odd note however, my cat was locked in my room once or twice and she used it! So your better off buying this for a cat and at that point please just stick to your litter box. Jeez.;0
80533;It seemed to help 2 of my 3 dogs.  The dog it didn't help has cushing's and possible yeast/staph infection and that's the main one I was need to have the ears healthy again.  Glad I only bought a small bottle.;0
61094;No complaints here. It works as promised and I've tested it out to about 300'. But dogs will be dogs and they can cover 300' before you know it. So other than wanting more range, it's a perfect product. The shock is pretty harsh to me, but the dog doesn't seem that bothered by it. I've actually only needed to use it a few times in several walks. The beeping seems to work well enough to get her attention, so I don't have to use the electric shock all that much. The dial allows me to dial it up or down. Most of the time I leave it at 4, but one time I did have to move it higher (but just one time, after that she now responds well to my voice or the beeping in the collar.)It makes training a naturally hyper hunter much easier and saves a lot of time.;0
52693;healthy ingredients, made in the USA. Good for sensitive stomachs, breaks up easily if you want to use it as little rewards. Doesn't smell strong. Low calorie treat.;0
36525;I used this on carpet where 4 male dogs had marked and marked!  It took away the odor by the next night, and lasted a few weeks.  The odor DID return, but I used this again, and it is masked again.  Helps if you have a problem urine area and can't replace the carpet just yet...;0
37639;I love this collar .. it's thicker and nice fleece on the inside.. I live in a cold climate so having a nice soft fleece collar is nice for my pup!;0
155151;There is still a little sweeping to do 3-4' past the mat, but I think my cats try their best to hold onto some of the litter just to keep me cognizant of who's in control. :) It's pretty stiff at first and kind of difficult to empty unless you have a large litter box. But after a few weeks, it loosened up, I got a bigger box, and the litter rolls out pretty easily. One caveat: if you use a dusty litter, the mat is going to look filthy all the time unless you're willing to damp dust it, which I'm not. I use Tidy Cat (with the blue lid) and that is not a problem. Just saying. Overall, I recommend this mat.;0
133397;These are the kind of dog treats that take the dog a few minutes to chew up.  They break into safe pieces so they won't get lodged in the throat or further down, but they still take a few minutes to eat as they are kind of hard.  I thought they smelled sort of medicinal, but my dog seemed to like them a lot.;0
87186;We used to have a DART but it was always breaking. The BOLT doesn't have as much laser control as the DART but the cats still love it. It's a little less noisy and the cats sometimes just want to lay near it when it's turned on. I don't really like the mirror control. It doesn't stay in place and slips super easily. So I had to tape it down. Other than that, it's a great purchase if your cats like laser toys.;0
25055;I was really looking forward to getting these scratchers - I had been buying them for my cats for years - but when the box arrived and I removed the protective cover, there were so many shavings in the scratcher that neither of my cats were interested in them. I had to take both units apart and shake all of the access cardboard out. Only then would my cats use them. I hope this isn't a trend, since these scratchers have kept my cats from sharpening their nails on the furniture for years.;0
75137;I love this stake for my beagle dog.  The only problem is that the latch that you hook it to your dog's collar with rusts.  This makes it almost impossible to use.  However, I love the blue rubber on the hand turn part.  The rubber makes it soooo much easier to put in the ground.  I just with the latch was rustproof.;0
117222;I have 3 Australian Cattledogs who are now 9 & 10 months old.  They are VERY aggressive chewers!  I have bought pillow type beds for them, which lasted only minutes before the stuffing was EVERYWHERE!  What a waste of money and a huge mess to clean up!  I decided to give the Kuranda bed a try and bought one for the most aggressive chewer first.  As soon as I put it down, she started frantically scratching the fabric.  To my surprise, this resulted in NO damage to the fabric!  Jessie has given it a first class test drive, and this bed has passed the test with flying colors!  She loves her bed, which looks just the same today as it did 2 months ago.  I will be ordering 2 more for the other 2 dogs.  There is some assembly required, but if you read the instructions, it isn't too difficult.  The fabric is stretched tight as a drum at first, but with use, it relaxes to a pleasant, though not too loose, sag.  Jessie gives this bed 2 paws up.  Buy it!;0
31604;These have a strong smell, so they are enticing when training.  My lab really loves them.  I break them up into small pieces during training.  They are soft and it is easy to break them apart.  Healthy and enticing--great product!  We may try the other flavors for fun, too!;0
33829;My English bulldog has extreme food and skin allergies.  We bought, what we thought, was the best food on the market only for her to still get chronic ear infections and constantly scratch.  We did an allergy test and sure enough she was allergic to majority of the main ingredients in other dog foods.  Natural Balance sweet potato and fish was the only food I found that I could feed her that wouldn't cause an allergic reaction.If your dog is experiencing allergies I would try this food before you spend the money on the allergy test.;0
63349;"I purchased this to keep my lab puppy from eating too quickly.  The ""Food Ball"", as we call it, works as it is supposed to.  It doesn't hold a lot of food (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup depending on the size of the pellets) but it's made out of a pliable rubber and will not scratch anything as it is nosed across the floor.  It keeps her occupied for a few minutes but not more than that.  The main drawback is cleaning the ball as after one turn around the room it's now wet and has picked up hair and dust bunnies hiding in the corners.  I would purchase this again.";0
70363;I really wanted this to work, but one look at it in the box and it was obvious it was way, way, way too large for my chiweenie. Bingo has a 10&#34, neck and weighs 10 lbs. This collar would have swallowed him whole. Maybe they sent me the collar for bigger dogs in the wrong package, but if the one I received was actually the YS300 &#34,For Small to Medium Dogs,&#34, all I can say is &#34,No way.&#34,Anyway, I wish I could review the product's performance, but I can't. I immediately boxed it up and requested a return. UPS came to pick it up the very next day, fortunately. Thank heaven for Amazon! At least you know, if you do take a chance on it, that you can return it if it's too big. But what a hassle for everyone...;0
32864;The cats love it and it is a quality product from Purina. I have nothing but Purina for all my critters ever since being a kid and the pets (Dogs,Cats,Rabbitts)have always been healthy with no gastrointestinal problems.;0

156792;If you read Dog Food Adviser, you know they do the chemistry and the math to determine how much of a food&#8217,s protein content comes from meat (as opposed to vegetables or grains).  Their comment?  &#8220,&#8230,this looks like the profile of a kibble containing a significant amount of meat.&#8221,The downside of &#8220,&#8230,a significant amount of meat,&#8221, of course, is the cost.  Meat simply costs more, and the price of Nutrience Grain Free reflects this.  Since Grain Free&#8217,s ingredients provide better nutrition, you can probably feed less.  Some people are sure they also save on pet healthcare costs by feeding a very high-end food.I definitely don&#8217,t see enough of these &#8220,soft savings&#8221, to cover the difference in the price.  As far as that goes, though, I&#8217,m sure I could save a lot on my own grocery bill by dumpster diving instead of going to the farmer&#8217,s market.  I&#8217,m convinced that getting my food from the market is better than getting it from a dumpster.  I&#8217,m convinced that feeding my dog a food with identifiable, quality ingredients is equally desirable.Some pet owners believe that feeding the same brand all the time is the best choice, but varying brands makes more sense to me.  I don&#8217,t think a dog&#8217,s digestive tract should be constantly challenged by feeding a different brand every day, but I do think feeding different brands of similar quality every few months may make up for anything my dog might be missing from a single brand.  I absolutely intend to keep Nutrience in this mix.;0
31819;I have a husky and terrier/schnauzer mix. The terrier/schnauzer isn't picky but he definitely LOVES these and was more motivated to do tricks and listen. The husky is a stubborn girl but for these she willingly does all tricks I ask/teach. i ordered the salmon and they loved it. I don't know why others complain about the smell its not horrible and nothing other than what I would expect for moist salmon treats, c'mon! I will be trying the peanut butter next.;0
122362;he likes some and takes his time with others. for a very few, he just leaves them there. I may order less than 25 next time if I can;0
10325;My dog has lost (or possibly buried) the original Kong I bought her, so this was purchased as a replacement. She absolutely adores it.;0
123552;"I have a German Shepherd that chews EVERYTHING to bits, tennis balls don't even make it back from one game of fetch.  I've tried all manner of balls, and they all either get chewed up in the first few minutes or they don't fit in the chuckit-which is the only way I have of running the energy out of the pup!  This ball has been going on daily playtime runs for over a month now, and there are STILL no signs of teeth marks (let me pause here and gasp incredulously).  I'm ordering more JUST IN CASE I lose this one, because there's no going back- this is the ONLY ball for me and my shepherd!Follow-up:  The ""small"" size is the same size as a tennis ball, and PERFECT for a chuck-it :D";0
148211;I have a 3 lb Boston Terrier puppy, and I read all the reviews about how small these run - so I ordered a medium and she literally walks out of it.  I should have ordered the XS!  Too annoyed to exchange it at this point.;0
87101;I borrowed this from a friend when my cats were cooped up inside for days due to snow and below zero cold. It distracted them from fighting out of boredom. It took a few minutes of skeptical observation from afar by the cats until one got interested and then the others. They tend to take shifts - one chasing while the others watch. No one fights over it.They like it best when the toy is on a shelf 15&#34, from the ground with the laser pointed down so it rotates in a long narrow loop on the floor (a hallway is good). Obviously it works best when its dark but you can see it in a semi dark room in the day. When you hit the on button it runs about 15 minutes then automatically shuts off.The cats were not interested when the weather was good and they could go out. So it makes for a good &#34,Rainy Day&#34, toy at my house.Safety Note: When you show it to cats for the first time they can be curious about the actual toy because it makes a small motor sound. I recommend supervision at first so they don't stare right into the laser light and hurt their eyes. Once mine began associating the motor sound with a laser light to chase on the floor they were no longer interested in the actual toy. I now feel confident about leaving them alone with it.;0
123950;These simple chews are good for removing tartar buildup that accumulates on your dog's teeth. They have Calcium and Phosphorus in them that will help build and maintain strong bones and teeth while cleaning teeth as they chew.My 2 year old Chihuahua loves to chew and these make a good low cost and basic chew for daily use. Even if your dog only eats one every couple of days it will still remove a lot of tartar that might not be removed otherwise.  It normally takes our small Chihuahua about an hour to finish one of these. She doesn't go crazy for these but she has never turned one down.  We like to give her one of these when company stops by in order to distract her because she also loves to bark at anyone who comes into the house. One FlatStick Calcibone will normally give us about an hour of quiet time.  I am not sure these would be great for larger breed dogs because they would be chewed up very fast.;0
36726;I love the Vittles Vaults! Just get the large one for my lab curs dry food and this one for my small dog. No insects can get in! The seal is tight and the food smells so fresh when you open it that you want a &#34,kibble nibble&#34, yourself! Comes with a 1 cup scoop! Plus, this smaller one stacks on my larger one. I personally think this is the BEST value to hold your pet food and I am even thinking about a smaller one for my flour! It won't fall apart!!;0
139978;I was looking for a pet food can cover. Both of my dogs get a scoop of canned food with their dry food, but one gets regular pooch food and the other has a special diet from the vet. The only can cover I had was one from the vet, I've looked around in stores, and the one thing I can't seem to find is a can cover that's as good as the one from the vet. I was getting tired of covering the one can with aluminum foil.So... I looked on Amazon. Found bunches of lids, with varying degrees of customer satisfaction. This cover, though, it seemed like everyone who has this one is pretty wild about it. A tad expensive, but I thought, if it's that good...Wow, this is great. The lids are set up to fit three sizes of cans, my guys' cans fit in the second size. The lids are floppier than I'm used to, but they're very easy to fit onto the can, no fussing around, making sure it's on there. And the lids stay on well. They wash up nicely in the dishwasher (I put them in a small-items basket on the top rack so I don't find them flung onto the heating element).Now I can see why people are crazy about these lids.;0
153027;These are long lasting, no odor. Most of the twists were of the 12 inch size. Our Border Collie puppy is a serious chewer and one stick will last a few days. Will purchase more.;0
66240;I bought this for my pug and it seems to be a very comfortable alternative to a collar.  It is also adorable, and she looks very cute in it.;0
151337;I rescued a one-year-old pit bull one year ago, and he, although completely awesome, has one issue--separation anxiety.  I'm sure it's tied to how he was treated and ultimately dumped, leading to him being rescued by me...but it's been a struggle.He has a standing Xanax prescription with the vet.  (The vet has witnessed this...it's so sad.)I was hopeful that this would help him.  I hate drugs, and really hate drugging him, because he gets so woozy on the Xanax.With two chew-tabs, there was no difference.  We found that giving him a shoebox full of papers, placed in &#34,his&#34, spot (atop a barstool) he can usually busy himself destroying the papers if I leave for a short time (bypassing the Xanax, and saving the house).  So, I left for school for just two hours.  I put the papers down, just in case, and well...upon arrival, every single paper was shredded, and he was in distress.  :(  I felt horrible, but glad I didn't leave him for a longer time.Now, my pibble is a special case, with a real problem.  I don't know how this would be for a dog with less stress and/or less bodymass.  He's 80 pounds, and ALL muscle.  His nature isn't hyper when I'm around.  He's really docile and sweet.  But when I am out of sight (yes, even if I am in the next room), he gets very upset.He's better than he used to be...but not good enough to have this be a help.So, if you have a big muscle-bound pibble with huge separation anxiety who is already taking Xanax, this might not be the best choice.  ,)Good luck, pet owners :);0
114442;My dogs seemed to really like these the first time I gave them one.  However, when I gave them a second one a few days later, I noted that my Lab and Boxer wound up with diarrhea and my Rottweiler was forcing herself to throw up until she finally brought up a huge piece of the filling.  It was hard like a rock and you could tell that many pieces of the filling had fused together.  I shudder to think what would have happened had she not been able to bring it up.  She won't even look at these treats - nor will my boxer.  My Lab seemsed to really like these so I cut them into smaller pieces and he did fine - but I will never buy these again.I have read a lot about these treats and realize my dogs may not have normal reaction to these treats.  It appears to be a love/hate - either the dogs really do well and love them or - like my dogs - don't do well and really hate them.;0
45627;I got this for my chinchillas. It came in an ugly, nasty baby-barf green color (ew) and is a little bit bigger than the size of my smallest chinchilla. Would recommend for rats or animals of the like. Not for guinea pigs & up.It seems to be made well, and makes a nice crinkly sound when touched.3/5;0
106316;Every evening my dog gets 1/2 his kibble in a bowl and 1/2 in a food dispensing toy. Believe me when I say we have a whole box of these types of toys for his enjoyment.These toys are very well made and hold up. They are not meant to be a chew toy and I pick them up once he's emptied it. They are not made of KONG rubber and aren't meant to be chewed. They're an interactive toy.This size is almost too small for my dog's kibble which makes it a real challenge for him. He eats Taste of the Wild, it is a normal sized kibble. Our puppy has smaller sized kibble and it basically pours out. But I think the XL would be too big and both dogs' kibble would pour right out so this size works for us.;0
71660;Pleasant aroma and good clumping ability. Cat is happy to use litter whenever he is in the house. 2 outdoor cats have even come in the house to use it!;0
75071;One of my little dogs loves these snacks but the other one seems to prefer the Duck strips. I buy both kinds.;0
123107;I have 3 dogs and I don't know why but they love these bully sticks so every month I order them and every day they get one I highly recommend them and I rather them chew them my furniture and fast shipping I but the ones that are 4- 6 inches because I have small dogs;0
12944;Our local animal shelter uses these exclusively and often requests them as donations.  Who would know more than an animal shelter about sturdy, non tipping, easily cleaned dog dishes? I sent them five.;0
71343;I guess our dog doesn't like sweet potatoes, because she will not eat this bag of dog food.  It sounds good to me, but I'm not the one expected to eat it.;0
5398;I've been using this product since I stopped buying the expensive penguin rite-sizeB cartridge. It's easy to use & you can save a lot of money.;0
73740;I use these to keep the ants away from humming bird feeder. They work really well in fact last for a couple of years. It looks like they are discontinued so this might be the last of them.;0
55710;We love this bowl. Its hold a very good amount of water that my dogs go through in a day's time. We were previously using an older tupperware plastic bowl that was the only thing large enough for them to have enough water last them in a day. The bad part was that tupperware isn't exactly smooth so it saved the grime and showed the grim at the water lines. We were constantly washing the water bowl and scrubbing old grime off. So I had about enough of that and went big on a bowl like this. So far after 2 weeks I don't get any slimy grime build up on it. If the water were dirty you can obviously see it right away too because of the shininess. It stays put in place and is very wide so both dogs can stick their fat heads in to get a drink at the same time. Its holds plenty of water as I said and with a quick rinse of some hot water and mild soap its no problem getting it squeeky clean if you just rub with your fingers. I like the bowl for sure and we shall see in time how durable it is. We are pleased.;0
33251;I'm not sure why this litter has so many positive reviews. I recently got my cats and have been experimenting with a few different litters and this has the been the worst so far. It clumps fine but odor control is horrible. It looks like gravel and makes me feel like I'm at a construction site. It's dusty and I feel like I'm breathing it in every time I scoop. I probably wont even finish the bag I have. That being said, the cats were okay with it.;0
13538;If you look at the hook for this it has a quite wide spacing, which allows the swing to slide off off the top of the cage and let your little bird plummet. Fix this by bending the wire close together so it won't  slip.;0
20736;Our bloodhound puppy loves the plush egg toys toys from Kyjen. We have bought a few others animals too.If you have a dog who likes to find items and dig them up, get this. Our puppy will play with this toy for hours. All we do is stuff the eggs back inside, then she pulls them out. Then we play fetch with the eggs for a little while, and start all over again.The eggs are stuffed with the white polyfill, so be aware of that if your dog chews one up. Ours has and you would be surprised at the amount of white polyfill all over the room from that tiny egg.;0
32424;My cats are very active and playful and they get into everything they're not supposed to. I've tried buying ssscat cans in the past, but after using multiple refills, all of them started to leak, and it was too much to keep up with. The scat mat sounded like a great idea, so I finally took the plunge and am glad I did. One of my cats got shocked by one the first night I put them out, and now neither of them will go anywhere near the mats. They are expensive, but after the initial investment, buying a 9v battery every once in a while is nothing.;0
92866;I found two little girl puppies abandoned in the desert.  I scooped them up and took them home.  They have grown and have needed new collars.  These collars are perfect.  So, when one chewed up the collar of the other I bought replacements.;0
86074;This is good cat food. I have two black and gray tabby's. They love it. With Amazon prime, I was able to have this delivered without a shipping cost. Really beats getting the boat going all the way into town to get cat food. And like I said, the cats love it. Prrrrrrrr.;0
140619;The subscription is simple and easy to manage.  This is a lot cheaper than buying at walmart. This is the food my babies want to eat.;0
16872;Love this little filter.  It is quiet quiet quiet and my tank water is crystal clear.  Between this and the snail in my little tank I couldn't be happier -- and my fish are happy too.;0
143458;Purchased for my golden retriever after seeing a bulldog playing with it at the beach. My dog loves it. Easy to pick up in his mouth, soft enough not to hurt his mouth, and lots of fun. Good for the yard, the beach, or the house (providing no breakables in the room).;0
95802;My dog loved his west paws frisbee for a long time, but it got a little cut in it from his teeth one time and the tear has just been expanding ever since with all the rough housing it gets. I saw this Orka one at Petco for around $13, but it seemed like it'd be perfect for him and his chewing, so I looked it up here on amazon as I do with many items to save money, and found it at half the price, as usual. We have had it for about a week now and it's held up nicely, he loves it we play fetch all day...;0
23612;I carry this when I walk my two cane corso (Italian mastiff) to ward off any loose dogs (irresponsible people, strays, losts).  My dogs will bite strange dogs that are loose and approaching us, so I carry this to stop the loose dog before my dogs can react.....inevitably even though MY dogs are LEASHED and under CONTROL as the law requires, they will most certainly be blamed because of their looks (big and blocky).  It is not fair, but I have to take the right precautions to protect MY dogs from idiots who let their dogs run loose.  I rarely even walk in my own neighborhood because people's dogs run right out of their yards....it is frustrating and ridiculous.  I have only had to use this once, and while it DID stop the dog (I have horrible aim, and did NOT hit it on the nose as you are supposed to but instead hit her forehead) and the dog ran away momentarily, she did return.  Luckily I was in MY OWN YARD when this happened and was able to get in my front door before the dog had the guts to rush us again (she stayed about 5 feet away).  This is meant to startle and deter a dog, and will NOT harm them...which is why this is my first choice of defense.  I dont want to hurt another dog as it is not their fault that their owners' are irresponsible idiots.  BUT that being said, I also carry pepper spray JUST IN CASE the citronella does not stop and the dog is aggressive (Pepper spray can spray back on YOU or your DOGS, so be very careful...which is hard when all of this happens in an instant.  And in some cases pepper spray will actually aggrivate an aggressive dog MORE).  And in the event that I am truely scared for MY OWN personal safety from a charging aggressive dog, then pure lead is my third option.....and I hope to never encounter any.  I would not rely on this as protection, just a detterrant to give YOU time to get away.;0
5813;It appears to me that my African Cichlids may be more at home with this product.  I feel that the closer you can get to the natural environment of your fish, the healthier they are. I do not know any way to prove it works, but I will continue to use it.;0
763;I bought this for my cats so when I go away for the night they still get fed in the morning. I was expecting the unit to be smaller than it is but overall it looks nicer than I expected and arrived very quickly. I am very happy with my purchase and I will update the review in a few months to let you know how it held up and if my cats figured out how to get to the food.;0
95374;I like this leash a lot. Helps to keep my arm attached to my body instead of being yanked away by my strong pitbull mix.;0
28500;Both of my cats love this squirrel and will hug him, toss him, beat him up, and sleep with him. His belly pouch actually stays firmly closed, which is grat as I don't want catnip all over the floor. Based on my cats' 5-star reviews of the squirrel, I bought a couple more for my mom's cat and sister's cat, who wholeheartedly agree. Four cats, 5 stars all around. I've never found another cat toy this universally popular.;0
26943;This is a good product. Sturdy, well designed, and our cats love to use it. That helps keep our couches with fewer scratches but this isn't a perfect solution, they still scratch the couch. Think of it as part of the solution. Excellent product though. I think it is worth the money.;0
8619;This is very large and sturdy. It requires a broomstick through the handle to work it into the ground, but it will not come out anytime soon. I have a lab and it stands up to her strength.;0
92905;This harness is perfect for walking my 50 lb. 9 month old lab mix.  It is easy to put on and is not big and bulky like some harnesses.  After reading the reviews, I ordered the Medium/Large (which I most likely would not have) and it fits perfect with just a few small adjustments.  Reflective stitching is a bonus!;0
11468;These feel more solid than any of the small terrarium water dishes I have found on Amazon.  They also look more authentic, not that my tarantulas really care.  I'd highly recommend starting with THIS ONE if you're trying to decide which brand to try.  I have eight of these (all small), and all have come in good, working condition.;0
99174;Purchased this to replace the standard Fluval Spec V light.  Initially, I had trouble trying to figure out how to extend the legs of the light.  Thankfully, an Amazon review mentioned that they're tight, and you may have to exert a little to extend the side legs.  Since then, I'm up and running, with no issues.  My fish look beautiful, and my plants are thriving.I also connected this light to a Current timer, the dimming function won't work, but otherwise they work well together.;0
68684;This is my second bottle of Water Clarifier. I love using this after my filter change to quickly clear funk that is released into the water after every cleaning. Also great if your child likes to (over)feed your fish.;0
53928;This smells wonderful, and if you have a dog that doesn't actually have problems with their ears (like my Aussie) it's a great product. BUT if you have a dog that tends to get ear infections (like my Golden), you need a better cleaner.;0
151887;This is the cutest cat bed ever. My cat loves to lay in it and play in and on it. It has kept its shape and was a great purchase;0
125237;My dog loves this bed - it's huge. He is 75lbs and there's plenty of room leftover with the XL. The color is also great and is easily washable. However, since getting this bed, I also got a Big Shrimpy brand bed from Amazon and the quality on that bed is better but this shape works great for a spot in the living room. I'd recommend this bed but the other is my favorite. The dog, of course, loves both.;0
32539;"I love how this blanket looks, but it is soooo tiny. It's literally the size of three hand prints. My westie is only three months and it won't cover him fully. Many people who reviewed this product said their dog bite the head off, but my pup hasn't. He doesn't seem to be interested in the blanket especially after we bought him a bigger and softer blanket. This ""blanket"" should be use to dry dishes. ,)";0
126270;A friend of mine had to put his cat down this week. He applied this flea treatment to his cat and it caused a red, open sore. He started to notice his cat was becoming lethargic and took him to the vet but it was too late. The cat's organs had already begun to shut down and it was too late to save him. The cat had suffered some sort of reaction to it and also, since the product did not work, his cat was infested with fleas and became anemic. Please, pass on this one.;0
74043;No more need to pick up stuffing.  No more need to worry about your dog choking on yet another squeaker so surgically removed by the doggy.All you need is a supply of plastic water bottles.  Even if you don't use bottled water, you can find an empty bottle around.Dog crunches on the toy, with the bottle inside.  Not much more to say except, if you want a less messy toy, this one is it.;0
85684;"Our Golden Retriever hungrily scarfs down this product.  She seems to think it's ""arfilicious.""  We will be buying more of it.  Amber recommends buying some for your hungry dogs!";0
26768;Have sisal scratching post on the cat towers of our home. Also have 7 (YES seven) cats, and have been finding thanks to 'Jackson Galaxy & My Cat from Hell', that I really needed more scratching surfaces for my babies. Our newest addition to our feline family, Buttercups Brittawnee Secret Squirrel, earned her name by finding out that she could jump and scratch around the SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post just like a squirrel! For some reason, my other cats took their dear sweet time discovering that the post was not just for the baby, but they are all coming around. I also have a wonderful horizontal scratching lounger, the everybody loves, but this SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post will soon be loved by all of my cat family! Smudging organic catnip into the sides of this scratching post drives our baby kitten wild and attracts the others as well! Love, love, love this product! Wish I could afford at least 2 more because I would make a window perch out them, and that would be the ultimate cat window perch because the height is perfect and it is sturdy enough to accommodate a piece of wood or mdf atop it! Hey, if you can afford 2, try my suggestion. But if you can only get one, you will not be disappointed...And your felines will love it!;0
9624;1x1x1 inches?  What is this, a rubber snack?  Not going to buy it if I can't tell what I'm purchasing.  This needs a better description.;0
100680;I really like the price, and the fact that these come as a combo pack.  My only complaint is that the daytime lights tend to burn out much more quickly than the night-time lights.  I always try to keep an extra box of lightbulbs handy, because they can be unpredictable as far as how long the lights last.;0
129335;I bought this as a training aid for my pup.  We had been working on recall, but she is highly distracted and would take off at the sight of a bird or a plane in the sky or who knows what.  I was worried about her getting hit by a car  or running off and getting lost.  This leash gave her the ability to roam and play and gave me a piece of mind knowing that she was still attached to me.  My biggest concern with a long line was it being able to hold her strength.  She's a forty pound little tank, and when she takes off, she has a 50ft head start.  But, so far so good. It's held up great over the last couple of months.  Only complaint is it's hard to wash and seems to hold on to the stench of whatever it was drug though.  Soaking this leash in a tub doesn't seem to clean it, and throwing it in the washing machine resulted in a huge tangle that took forever to undo.  I haven't found a good way to clean it yet, which may be why it stinks so bad.  I still use it because I'd rather be safe than sorry, but the smell of mud, poo, and ocean isn't doing it any favors.  Definitely sits outside in a little box far far away from our noses.  I just wish there was an easier way to wash it.;0
37911;The amount of skim the first week was amazing to see it working.  I did have a skimmer from Instant Ocean and it was crap compared to this unit.  Coralife's Bubble production from the motor is great.  I did have a problem two weeks into running... the motor starting making noise.  It was the plastic housing holding the motor shaft in place, was cracked.  I removed the cracked part of the housing so that it was wouldn't fall loose into the motor causing more damage and decide to sill run it.  Called their customer service and a new housing would be replaced, no hassle, no questions asked other than name and address.;0
6699;Have been using WeeWee pads since I brought my dog home, these are great. The only thing, my dog needs two. He will not mix his business, #1 goes on one pad #2 goes on another. Oh well :);0
97501;I got this to mix with the chlorahexadine shampoo that my vet gave me for my dog's skin issues.  The vet's shampoo doesn't lather well, but this one does.  It also smells wonderful.  I'm not sure how it would work on itchy skin alone, but it blends well with the other shampoo I have to use on my dog and allows me to work up a good lather.  He looks clean and shiny afterwards and smells nice for days.;0
23625;I have a king sized Dober-girl (100 lbs.) who has accidents at night sometimes.  This diaper does the trick! Excellent;0
68341;I did a ton of research on raw prepared food for dogs before deciding on this product and feel happy about my purchase. My dog had a severe issue w/struvite bladder stones a year and a half ago and had been on Hills C/D to prevent reoccurrence, but due to the poor nutritional quality of the prescription food, I decided to go the 'raw route' which my research indicates is the way to go for the all around well being of dogs in almost all cases. (If your dog has struvite issues that have been diagnosed as GENETIC rather than bladder infection related, by all means LISTEN TO YOUR VET for the best course of action!!)The food was shipped very quickly in an impressive carton complete with dry ice, well insulated in Styrofoam. (My dog always seems to know when a package is for 'her' and crowds me when I open these boxes. She was super curious about the dry ice, so use caution opening the box on the floor if your pooch is the same way.)Medium size hockey puck shaped patties are frozen solid and come on a resealable bag which fit well in my refrigerator's freezer. (The bag is taller rather than wider so the space saving's nice!)  They take about 30 minutes to thaw at room temp, but since this is raw meat, I would recommend thawing in refrigerator if you take them out sooner than a half hour before feeding. This product contains finely ground bones as well as the meat, so if you have hesitated to feed raw due to the choking or piercing of insides from bones, this product is a godsend.I initially offered my dog a small taste of one before mixing with her other food and she rejected it, although when I mashed them up and mixed in with other food she's familiar with, she ate them with no problems.  I started her out with 1 patty for a 5 day period, then 2 patties for another 5 days and finally 3 patties - reducing her other 'processed' food accordingly.  No stomach upset whatsoever, even though I've had problems with that before when introducing a new food.The downside of this product is the cost to feed.  My dog's 40 lbs and if I fed her this product exclusively it would be a small fortune.  The guidelines recommended (for this product only) are as follows for my dog's size and activity level:40 lb dog - moderate activity level:12 ozs twice a day (total of 24 oz for 1 day of feeding)Do the math - The bags holds 56 ozs and I should feed 24 ozs a day.  This would mean less than 3 days worth of food for $20+ dollars!I have made my bag last a month by using this product in conjunction with other foods (canned salmon, red and sweet potatoes, another brand of dehydrated raw food).  The beauty of this is that it's raw meat, compliments other foods, and does not need to be fed exclusively, so for the piece of mind my dog is off the canned and the BHA/BHT laden kibble, it's well worth it.4 stars for the cost of the product.;0
21499;My doggie LOVES this toy, which means I LOVE this toy.  He grabbed it out of my hands as soon as i took it out of the box and plays with it every day.  Great idea -- great toy.;0
96878;My puppy loves to come with me pretty much wherever I go and he feels very secure in this carrier.  It is a good size for him...he is a Maltese.  (I got the medium and it is the black croc style...no flowers!);0
79857;My cat's sores are healing nicely.  He doesn't mind the daily application, he used to run away when I was using another brand.Happy cat, happy me!;0
136093;This stuff works well but you do end up with purple paper around... we have to brush Buddy our guinea pig off before we can hold him...;0
47480;I use these pads for the kitties that are in my enclosed sun porch. They love them. Aren't quite warm enough for outside use.;0
125543;Ive actually been feeding our Doxie this for many months...I found this larger...better priced...bag to purchase.  I put about 1/8th. cup of water in her bowl with about 1.5 oz. (a heaping 8th of a cup) and let it sit 5+ minutes, so it plumps...she loves this and struggles with her patience for me to sit it down. She gets this 2 a day, morning and dinner time. It has kept her weight in check, plus her health is good...she also has a shiny coat.;0
5467;We buy them often and will continue. Our cats love these more than any other toys. They wear well too.;0
85745;I think if you are buying random dog food at the grocery store the Purina Beneful is probably one of the best available. If you're truly looking to buy the BEST dog food, then you're not shopping at the grocery store in the first place. For the average dog the Beneful offers the basic nutritional requirements of course and it goes a little farther than the generics out there. The three dogs in our house that tried it (mixed with their normal far more expensive organic food) ate with no hesitation. They seemed to like the flavor and only one of them had any digestive upset and that was very mild.I could not give the Beneful to the other three dogs though and this is the reason for the one star deduction....it contains corn. If you have a dog with skin allergies then you know you have to avoid corn, wheat and soy in their food and treats. Bottom line... if you're feeding a regular dog and your dogs has NO allergy issues, then Beneful is a decent choice. Just beware.. contains corn and that could be a big problem.;0
43804;This is a great deal for a good quality treat. I use them for training and my pup loves them!;0
21814;"Premier Twist and Treat / B0002I0RLWThis is a nice little treat dispensing toy, but it's a bit tricky for humans to handle. The toy is shaped like a child's spinning top, with two halves (top and bottom) that unscrew from each other. You unscrew the top half, and try to balance the bottom half with one hand while you pour doggy kibble and tiny, cut-up treats into the bottom half. Once the bottom half is full, you use your ""food pouring hand"" to screw the top half back on. It's a bit of a balancing act, and I prefer theOmega Paw Tricky Treat Ball, because the Omega ball is much easier to fill. Maybe two parent families will have an easier time with the Premier.As for doggie enjoyment, my puppy likes the Premier Twist and Treat well enough, mostly because he's discovered that one really hard bat of the paw will cause the toy to spin on its axis and pretty much expel all the food right away. (My puppy is currently 4 months old, and 12 pounds.) Once again, for a better time-to-treat ratio, I recommend the Omega ball.Still, the puppy likes both the Premier and Omega and I like giving him a variety of toys, so this gets 4 stars from me. I have not had any troubles with toy durability, but I'm also blessed with a puppy that doesn't chew very much (yet!). I *highly* recommend filling this toy primarily with the dog's usual kibble, with a few treats interspaced in the mix as ""surprises"". There's really no need to stuff it full of treats - the puppy enjoys the toy just as much, and it makes ""dinner time"" a more interactive and exercising experience! I chop my doggie treats up very finely for training purposes and my puppy is always eager for the taste of a treat without filling up or getting sluggish or fat.~ Ana Mardoll";0
135497;One can, and my kitten will no longer eat his dry food. My boy would rather lick around the Tiki Cat bowl, than eat his kibbles now. I guess I'll be ordering more Tik iCat.;0
30190;No the best product for my money but it's and ok toy.  Some cats may like it but my cat was not crazy about it.;0
7453;Sometimes, a really intricate and full-featured treat pouch just isn't what you need.  You're going on a simple walk, and you don't want bulk.  Also, sometimes your bulkier or more complex training bag can't isolate a really high-value (smellier) treat without mixing it up with something else.  This pouch closes easily (although it is sometimes a two-handed action to close it), holds a convenient small amount of training-size treats and is made of a durable fabric.Special highlight: the belt clip is super easy and yet doesn't come off with everyday use unless you want it to!  Some belt clips are sticky or extra-tight, this one is perfect, in my opinion.  I will sometimes wear this pouch in addition to my more many-pocketed training bag to hold a high-value reward or a simpler dry biscuit, or even a tennis ball.  An ergonomic, doggie-proof, spill-proof and comfortable little guy!;0
19163;Gross, messy, time-consuming. You really have to thump it around to get litter clumps moving. It's really messy rolling the thing around. I went back to twenty seconds a day of scooping a normal litter box.;0
33944;Dogs got diarrhea everytime I gave them one of these, threw them out,  will not try them again, sorry for the dogs.;0
80057;My little man loves these but I will not be getting them again. Not until I find some made in the USA.;0
2945;Good seal, no problems woith bugs in the food.  I keep it in the garage.  I like that you can see how much food is left, it helps to know when to re-purchase.Good capacity, too.;0
67528;I love it and my poodle loves it. Now he can see outside when he goes for a ride. Good quality product, looks nice and a reasonable price too.;0
123157;My cat doesn't seem to detect any change to her water and her tartar seemed to be getting better in the last month I've used this additive.;0
105780;Works very well.  No leak when it's in the lock position.  For some reason my dog  prefers drinking out of this instead of his water bowl at home.  You can also twist it off to drink it and dispense it for your dog if needed.;0
37489;Our cat went crazy over it. The novelty has wore off a bit but that is probably because it isn't something new anymore. She still plays with it though. At least for the foreseeable future, all we'll have to do is squeeze it a bit to refresh the catnip scent. When that stops working we will spray it with catnip oil.;0
124538;Received this lounger from the Seller in excellent time, way before the estimated delivery date. Have 6 cats (in New York City!) and did not even have to coax any of them to scratch on it. Seller was prompt, courteous and offered the best price point on this particular style lounger. Its lines are as nice as a piece of Art Deco furniture. This product is easy to put away when company comes, as our placement for it is by the coffee table in the living room. Have noticed that our cat family have scratched less on things that they should not and it has only been a few days! Only one note of concern, and it is not about the Seller, have noticed that one of my kittens has been throwing up since the arrival of this lounger. Am not certain if it is product related, or what, but it coincides with the arrival of the product. Will keep you posted for an update to let you know, though.Would definitely recommend this product from this Seller.;0
154417;I've long used the Angel Eyes powder for my Maltese.For some reason, she had a very bad attack of both tears and tear stain.  No matter what I did, we couldn't get rid of them.I ordered this product out of desperation.  It worked!One word of caution....I tried giving her a whole chew, but it gave her very loose stools.  I cut it down to 1/2 and it seems to work just fine.  My dog weighs 7 lbs.;0
126076;When you get your fingers near a catnip toy and play with the cat, you risk getting scratched.  The longer tail is perfect for dangling it in front of the cat's nose and then letting them have it to scratch, chew, and kick the hind legs on.;0
141436;We bought this item for one reason only - to get our lab to stop barking outside, driving us and the neighbors crazy.  She will bark, bark, bark and refuses to come in the house,totally blows us off when we call her.  Our results here are probably a bit unique because we already use the PefSafe Containment system so our dog is used to an electronic collar.  We've had great success with that fencing system with three dogs now, love it and now we LOVE the remote trainer.  I put it on her last night and let her outside, which usually begins the barking marathons and sure enough, she started.  I stepped outside and yelled for her to COME, and of course she didn't.  I pushed the sound signal ONLY on the remote, and she immediately came in the house happily.  She did not even require a correction.  This morning when I let her out, I made sure she saw the new collar and put it on her in addition to her fence collar, and she went outside to do her usual morning roaming without even one bark.  When I went out and called for her to come in she came inside with the first call.  Now, again, she is used to an electronic collar so if this is new for your dog you may not get such immediate results, but I can't say enough good things about PetSafe and their products.  They WORK.  There are cheaper remote trainers, but I stuck with the brand that has worked for us with the fencing, and I'm glad I did.  Barking problem solved!;0
63226;These do not offer the cleanest cut.  Right out of the package they seemed very sharp but when used on nails of a few different cats they did not give that super clean cut.

4661;I ordered one of these for the Hydro Pro sponges in my 75 gallon goldfish tank. This pump runs much more quietly than the less powerful Whisper pump I was using before, and it creates a good flow through my sponge filters. I purchased this pump last August. It's February now, and this pump still works as quietly and effectively as when I first bought it. If I have any major problems in the near future, I will update this review, but as of now I am quite pleased.UPDATE: My pump is still running effectively and quietly. It continues to work from both outputs (which is more than I can say for cheaper pumps that tend to give out within a year). I purchased a second one of these for another tank located in my bedroom, and it's running just as effectively and quietly as the first. These do cost a bit more, but it's worth the extra boost in performance and reliability, in my opinion. Unless something better comes along, this will be my go-to filter for my larger tanks.;0
16131;I've used this stuff for years and it works great.  It drys out (as would jello) but if you just keep it hydrated it will stay in its form for several days.  I use a capful ever 4-7 days.  It's perfect to put with the Fluker's Orange Cube Complete Cricket Diet into a safe container for the crickets.  Add a thin layer of water to the bottom of it and it will stay hydrated.  Don't mix this product with anything that should be dry (such as cricket feed) because it will dry out quicker and crickets wont survive as long.;0
40563;This is a quality product, very gentle and flexible pins.  Makes grooming my tibetan terrier mix so easy.  Should have purchased this years ago instead of trying many other products that cost less.  Definitely worth the money.;0
138463;It's very vibrant and I think it would totally serve its purpose. Now if anyone has any tips for getting it out of my puppy's mouth and onto his wriggling, twisting back, please let me know!;0
61243;However somehow they manage to pull them out of the accompanying rubber toy these are intended for in a short matter of time.  So unless you have a small and I mean petite dog I doubt these will last as long as desired.;0
46379;I've had this for our turtle tank for a while, it's a 50 gallon tank but usually filled about 30-40 gallons. One complaint is the top doesn't quite fit right. There were more times that it fell off into the water after replacing filters or didn't fit on right that we have stopped putting the top over the filter which makes it ugly and I suspect a bit louder than intended.For our 2 small turtles and the miscellaneous bottom feeders in the tank it's been adequate. Levels are good (after we got the tank established) and the filter and the bottom feeders keep the tank pretty clear. I haven't had any problems with the functionality and the tank even smells like fresh pond water (lovely out camping, wilderness, water when you're right up against the tank) I will probably not buy it again because I'm looking to upgrade to a higher quality filter and am planning to make an investment and not a cheap, that'll do, purchase.AS FAR AS WHISPERYea the filter is whisper quiet when the water level is right up to the lip, let evaporation do it's job and it'll drive ya nuts. Though when that much waters evaporated the noise has served as a good, maintenance and cleanup reminder.Perfect purchase to get your tank started then decide what you want to upgrade as the lifecycle of starter items is usually ~1-1.5 years, then spend the money on quality items individually since it's often tough to buy a bunch of high quality items up front.;0
149438;"As pet food, this Standlee Hay Company Premium Western Timothy Hay is a great buy. It is excellent quality hay (much better that I have seen in pet stores, etc.). It comes very well packaged, sealing in the freshness and it smells very sweet when opened. The hay is first packed in a thick plastic bag and then placed inside a sturdy cardboard box (see customer image I uploaded). The dimensions of the 10 lb box are: 16"" tall, 15"" wide, and 15"" deep.This hay is also a great buy as inexpensive nesting material for Purple Martins. Martins prefer gourds/housing that look as though they have been previously used by other Martins and this Premium Western Timothy hay is an inexpensive nesting material for lining Purple Martin gourds/housing to achieve that look in preparation for Purple Martins returning in the spring. I usually put a level teaspoon of Sevins Dust and another of diatomaceous earth in the bottom of the gourds and cover it with a handful ofAspen Chipsfollowed by a layer of Timothy Hay and then sprinkle another teaspoon of diatomaceous earh inside the entrance along the outside edge of the nesting material and then jostle it a bit to settle it in. This will kill any mites that the birds might bring in with them. Mites leave the birds after feeding and travel throughout the nest where the diatomaceous earth and Sevins Dust kills them. Once this dust, chip and hay preparation is complete the returning birds might or might not remove some of what I have added and then happily begin building their own nest to their liking and I never have a problem with mites on my adult or baby birds and they all seem quite happy. I do change the nests once the babies are old enough, following the same procedure above.Timothy Hay and Aspen chips (a hardwood chip) are very similar to what Purple Martins make their nests out of naturally (when not offered other nesting materials) and they tend to attract new Purple Martins to gourds/housing. Purple Martins naturally start their nests with straw, dried grasses (hay), twigs and sometimes mulch if they can find it, and to this they build a mud dam right beneath the front entrance hole. They then will pick fresh leaves to line their nest and lay their eggs on. It is thought that they use the fresh leaves to keep their eggs moist.When using Timothy Hay or Kaytee Aspen Chips/Shavings, rosin and aromatic hydrocarbons (two allergenic/toxic substances found in pine straw/needles, and pine and cedar chips/shavings) are not a concern as neither contain them. Kaytee Aspen Chips/Shavings are made from the non-toxic hardwood Aspen tree.  Aspen chips and shavings are the only wood chips/shavings approved by the FDA and EPA for use by humans and animals and are suggested for use as nesting material by a US Fish & Wildlife health center.There are those that avoid using wood chips and hay as Purple Martin nesting materials believing them to be more susceptible to moisture retention and instead use pine straw/needles because they contain pine resin that makes them moisture resistant. But ironically, the very thing that makes the pine straw/needles moisture resistant, the pine resin - a.k.a. rosin, is also a substance that both people and animals might have or develop serious allergies to. One of my dogs is highly allergic to the rosin from coniferous trees and breaks out in a terrible rash (dermatitis) when she comes into contact with it on the bare skin of her under-belly. Rosin is also found in cedar chips (and other coniferous tree wood chips and shavings) and newspaper ink, two other items regularly used for nesting material for Martins, and so I wouldn't use or recommend using cedar chips, other coniferous tree chips, or shredded newspaper as nesting materials. Rosin might not affect adult birds with feathers, but new hatchlings' skin is bare.In addition to rosin, pine straw/needles also contain allergenic/toxic mold spores that gather in both the needles and bark of pine trees during wet conditions. And both pine and cedar wood chips and shavings also contain aromatic hydrocarbons, which studies have shown to have a negative impact on the health of both humans and animals. These hydrocarbons are absorbed through the skin on contact with these woods and then enter the bloodstream, or they are inhaled as wood dust particles, causing asthma and respiratory infections, impairing the liver's ability to detoxify, weakening the immune system, and possibly causing cancer (a study found that woodworkers exposed to aromatic softwood dust have a higher incidence of squamous cell cancers of the respiratory tract).";0
27364;I bought this shampoo because we have to shampoo our Schnauzers quite often. One of them is white but this shampoo works well for both of them. It smells good - not overpowering - and they are soft as can be. We highly recommend it.;0
155476;I have two cats and two litter boxes, side by side. I filled the smaller one with this litter and left the regular litter (Precious Cat Ultra Premium Clumping Cat Litter) in the other box. After several days, here's the verdictPros:Room smells great...even better than the full-time air filter.Smaller granules tracked from the panLess litter comes with the removed feces and urineCons:The urine clumps readily fall apart before making their way out of the box. This is awful really. It means only the feces truly makes it out. I think even the cats notice because after the first day, they would only poop in this box.All told, while I like the idea of this litter, it really doesn't work for me and the kitties. Urine clumps that fall apart and cats avoiding the box are not signs of a 'winner' cat litter in our house. That said it does smell great AND it tracks out fo the box much more discreetly than the other litter.Pick what's important to you as an owner.;0
67480;Love the extra long handle that allows me to reach to the back molars of my Rottie without losing a finger :)  Dog also like the toothpaste.;0
22221;All I needed was 1 rinse to take away all the grime and dirt on my very hairy dog. So far, no scratching or biting herself. No reaction to the soap either.;0
40915;Tough and durable these balls fit into ANY launcher that would accommodate a tennis ball. I personally love them because they don't crack or break like standard tennis balls, they don't get muddy either since you can wash them.;0
3251;Very pleased. My tank is clear and my fish are happy. Using and cleaning this filter is easy. I like the 3 tier system.;0
123326;Nice weight metal for combing through wavy or curly haired dogs.  Comb teeth are strong and smooth and do not bend.  Combs through hair smoothly.;0
30403;We use this for our dog with EPI, We mix it with her enzymes with a little water and form it into little balls and freeze. Because it is so concentrated and the enzymes are added in advance, her system tolerates it very well. She can't have regular dog treats. Out other dog loves them, too.;0
49406;I foster Kittens/Cats. They all love these. Came in different sizes so the little kittens and the big cats have a size perfect for them.;0
2816;I have been struggling to get my cat to eat after her diagnosis.  She does not like prescription foods!  She will eat a Rx food for a day or two and then turn up her nose.This one is the one she tolerates the best.  I still have to mix something else in to get her to eat it, but she will eat it most days and will eat more of it than any other food I try to feed her.  I will be anxious to see how her readings are the next time we go in.  At this point, the vet said eating is more important.  So I do what I have to do!I do appreciate that this food is way less expensive than prescription food.  It also has a higher fat content than others, which I'm thinking is probably good for kidney kitties and keeping weight on them (although sometimes I wonder if it's a bit too fatty?).  Overall, I am happy and will keep ordering it.  Thank you!;0
41996;We have used this product or its Feliway equivalent since January and seem to be enjoying some success with it. The initial problem had been an adopted tomcat who wanted to spray after we brought him into the house and that has stopped.There is no noticable odor with this product to humans but the results seems to have an impact on our cats. Hat's off to chemistry.;0
122958;There have been dumb comments about the fact that the items on toy are held together with twine.So what?Anyone who has a bird (and doesn't have a birdbrain themselves) knows how much bird toys cost... and that they are WAY overpriced. I've NEVER seen so much for the $$. So if your bird tears it apart and pieces fall to cage floor use a couple of brain cells and make individual toys out of the pieces with rawhide strings. Order this you will NOT believe what you get for $11.00. Im ordering a 2nd one to give a friend who has 3 birds. I have 2 medium sized parrots and they are mesmerized with this thing.;0
135577;Not much to say about a product that works exactly as advertised, day in and day out to keep my aquariums lit.;0
112274;Great idea! It worked the 1st time my dog stepped on it. She did not need a 2nd time. Wonderful product.;0
8073;The black seeds (they look like poppy seeds, not sure if they are?) weren't touched.  The rest was a hit!;0
130617;The dog likes them, but I am not happy with them. When the dog eats them, thy get stuck to his teeth and he sits there and smacks his lips and tongue for a while. They also break easily into crumbly messy pieces. By the time we are at the bottom of the jar, a quarter of the bag has been reduced to powder. Probably won't buy again. I prefer treats that help keep the teeth clean, not ones that get stuck and damage the teeth.;0
136967;I ordered this thinking it might be wrong. The picture showed a full 48&#34, long lid but it is not. It is a normal lid that is split into two 23&#34, sections that hinge :) It fits my tank &#34,LIKE A GLOVE&#34,I am very happy now :));0
58356;This is a great product.  I purchased two of them and I bought the DC converter so I don't have to buy batteries.  Just plug it in and forget it.  It takes care of feeding both my cats at the right time and the right amount.  It holds a lot of food so I can go away for a week and know the kitties will be happy. A wonderful invention.  I highly recommend to both cat and dog owners.;0
144672;Ok. I admit to being aa neat-nick. I love being organized. This product appealed to that side of me. Well, I received the suction cups and tried to use them. To make a long story short, I couldn't get them to stick and stay. Incidentally, at least one of the tube holders was defective. I wouldn't buy them if I had it to do again.;0
53037;If you combine two of them they make a very sturdy and large cat tree and it will cost you less this way than buying a giant tree. Just one will be top heavy as the base is small. I am adding a review photo so you can see the double tree at work.;0
129715;The only time my pup will really use this is in the pool and thats just to retreive and bring back to me. But its a tough little toy and if its lasts longer then a few months with my top, it deserves 5 stars;0
9952;Good comb, heavy in your hand, and works good and good price.  Gently use on your pet. I recommend combing slowly.  Thank you.;0
112433;"I ordered this for my 7 month old, 16 lb Cavalier/Bichon puppy.  It is a very well constructed basic coat.  The outside has kind of a vinyl feel but does not shed water.  I think it is going to be very wind resistant.  The inside has a thick, plaid fleece lining.  I think the type of outer shell along with the thick fleece lining will make this a very warm coat.  It is very easy on and off with no obstruction of the collar for attaching a leash.  Velcro tabs go aross the chest and a wide velcro belt goes around the belly.  The chest tabs are wide (4"") so there is good coverage there. It fits him perfectly and the price was great.  I looked at similiar coats in Petsmart which were not as heavy or well made and were priced at $30.00.";0
83287;My two young cats love these.  We've had them for months and they still play with them.  Squeak is still going strong!;0
58873;This is an amazing product!  It does suck batteries, but it is well worth it for the peace and quiet.  We've moved since using it, and have lent it to a friend in need and she was amazed at how well it worked for a young yapper and and older dog barking.  I also recommended this to another friend who bought one and she said after years of never being able to enjoy her back yard due to neighbor's barking dogs, she can now enjoy sitting in her own back yard again.  Highly recommend!;0
130563;I have 2 70ish lb dogs that loved this toy. Problem is that it barely lasted 5 minutes before they had it filleted open. They enjoyed playing with the fabric carcass for a few days. This one is definitely not invincible. We have bought other Kyjen toys and had better results -- I recommend getting the snake!;0
120392;"I have trouble with the claim that they spin/twirl more because of the extra feather.  I've only used one of the two I bought, but that one that I used didn't twirl very much at all.  That being said, I like the product and so does my cat.  Even all chewed up, it still looks like a fleshed-out bird and my cat just as eagerly chases it as much as she did when it was brand new.  This chewed up ""bird"" still gets the job done.  This same cat liked the two-feather variety, but as soon as it got chewed up, she lost interest.  So far, this three-feather bird has lasted her at least twice as long.  Try it.  Your cat will love you for it!";0
154538;I have purchased several beds from dogbed4less.com . Love their product! The covers are made really well and very durable. I had an old memory foam pad that I cut up and used the denim covers to make more dog beds. I have 5 dogs and wanted to give them something comfy to lay on. I highly recommend dogbed4less products!!;0
98567;With three cats, having fresh water available all the time can be tricky. The Drinkwell Platinum Fountain does just that and this is the perfect accessory to it. Other mats will do the job but take up unneeded extra space. This does the job without making the footprint of the fountain larger than needed.;0
83209;Since we have 200 pounds between 3 hound dogs, I've got a lot of mouths to feed.  I want the best for our dogs, however cost can be a factor.  This is the best price I've found, and I can buy 3 packages for the price of buying two at our vet.  Plus, when I order them they arrive very quickly, no tax or shipping!!;0
96652;My dog is very picky.  I like the product as an owner since it seems healthy.  However, my dog does not like the food and prefers his wet food.  Who can blame him?  He mops around and doesn't want to eat the food which is annoying.  But other than that, it's alright.;0
102058;this product is wonderful, but it's only downside are not it's own fault.  we put dog kibble in it, and unfortunately using the product (which my dog loves and it keeps him occupied) leaves little crumbs of food everywhere, and we have to limit our usage b/c we're afraid it will attract bugs.  as much of a foodie my dog is, he's not scrappy for crumbs, so they just stay on the floor.oh and also there's only one hole, and my dog didn't quite get that, so we drilled a second hole in the back, and it works much better that way.  he's not the smartest dog hehe.;0
80836;My rats are zooming through this and climbing up the outside of it all the time. I attach it to their cage with a zip tie to keep it stable. They are nibbling on it a bit. After a while I cut the zip ties and take it out to rinse it thoroughly then put it back in. I'll have to replace it eventually, but that's ok.;0
149362;I've had this for a couple weeks now and i cant say i recommend it. Its a confusing product to learn, isnt easy to use, and is pretty limited in terms of space. If you still are interested in it, I do my best in the following to explain how it works and the issues.Firstly, if you dont use an retractable leash for you dog this definitely isnt for you. In this organizer you put the leash in the middle and wrap the velcro handles around it so the end result is the handle sticking out of the bag for you to hold. I dont use a retactable leash so i have to attach the velcro handles around my belt and doing that everytime is a hassle.Now that i tried to explain about that ,let me go through the usage:(1) the flap at the front is hard to open and requires 2 hands.(2) now once you manage to open the flap you are presented with just 4 slots. 2 on the left are really small and im not quite sure what useful thing can go in there. The middle slot is the biggest and for your phone, this one fit perfectly for my samsung galaxy s2. it also has an additional velcro handle to further secure your phone is place. the last slot is for the poop bags , with a slit in the middle to easily draw them out. but once again its pretty small, dont expect to have more than ~3 at one time.(3)behind the slots is the middle portion of the bag where you attach the retractable leash. you can also squeeze some extra stuff under this because there is access to that middle portion after you open the flap at the front.;0
100842;Works perfect in my home made system. Filters well and easy to remove. I really like this product. Will purchase again.;0
15610;Our cat loves to get in and do his business in privacy and he uses it more frequently than a wide open one. However there are two issues wit this box- the filter placeholder is may not stay put properly for long so you may eventually have to resort to duck tape.- There is little purpose of the cleanstep because the cat sometimes leaves the dome from almost at the exit so he does not step on the cleanstep there there's little everywhere.;0
56785;So i bought this litter because it's flushable, i had to mix this litter with my scoop-away so my cat doesn't freak out much... i was adding more and more of this litter and less and less of scoop away, eventually in about 2 weeks i went all World's Best Cat litter and this is when problems started.I noticed that my cat didn't pee or poop for a day so i started worrying, next day - still nothing, this is when i realized that he is probably peeing somewhere else... Yup, right on a rug by the door. i tried to convince him to use this litter by putting catnip - nope, he just hated it so much i had no option but put scoop away back - the minute i put scoop-away back he went to his litter box immediately and problem was gone. My cat has never EVER had even a single accident outside the litter box, this was his first time ever, even when he was a kitten he used litter box without any issues, even if litter box was messy - he was fine jumping through his own poop but always used litter box religiously.I admit - i loved that my cat didn't smell like scoop-away fragrance and i am most definite it's good for cats not to step and then lick their paws with bunch of chemicals my scoop away has but unfortunately for me he is not in love with it. Scooping and flushing was another favorite part of this litter, i think above two pluses get one star since i kinda like the idea but since my cat did not i can't rate it higher.i totally agree with previous comments about this litter being smelly - yeah it doesn't hide smells as good as regular litters.;0
145956;This is a simple machine, but the cats love it.  And it's much easier to take apart for cleaning than their old Drinkwell fountain.  You have to be sure to raise the front edge to let invisible air clear itself out of the line when you first plug it in after cleaning it, but it's a simple step to prevent problems.  My gang of six seems perfectly satisfied with their new watering hole.  Of course they still insist on using the other sink in the bathroom, and the dog only thinks the two bowls on the floor are his.;0
69490;I have a quaker parrot and they are one of the few parrots who like to sleep in a nest versus on a perch. My parrot LOVES this nest. Miraculously he does not poop in it, but if he did it would be pretty difficult to clean.;0
46377;I use two pumps in my turtle tank I have a 55 gl but this one I have too put on a brick it can go in the water all the way so I love it it works great, the filters are great and most of the time a good price I buy the filters all the time , but I do reuse them just clean them;0
47900;I never would have thought this toy would amaze my cat.....she loves it, especially at 3am!! I will probably be getting another one to put downstairs for them as well.;0
97230;I bought this toy 6 months ago, and there isn't a single tear in it! That being said, my dog is not a huge chewer but his other fabric toys of the same age have not held up quite so well. I received a purple elephant, and it's very cute. I'll definitely purchase another when he needs another toy.;0
84179;We bought this toy because it's very cute and thought it would endure our terrier.  Within a day she had chewed off a couple of the flapping feet and the tail. =(  We watched the video from the Kyjen website and thought this toy would be alot of fun for the dog to play with.  We normally love all the Kyjen toys, but this one just didn't hold up, at least not with our dog.;0
28875;My German Shepherd loves chewing, but for some reason, these just do not interest her at all. She'll occasionally carry one around in her mouth from one room to another, but she won't chew them. Maybe other dogs like these, but they were a waste of money for us.;0
93444;I gave it away to a neighbor....his dog ate them, based upon his pup, it would get 2.5 stars but not mine;0
123494;Very well made and durable! I have three pit mix pups and they can tear through and destroy just about anything in just minutes if not seconds but this ball is still in one piece with no missing pieces after weeks of chase and chew. There are not even any scratches on it.;0
136606;Works great, lightweight, and perfect size for a small dog.  All of the mechanics seem to be working well, so would recommend.;0
128344;The cats just love it...I put in the Catit tracks and they play with it all the time when they are not eating or sleeping. Just hope when the battery goes dead I can replace the batteries in it.;0
95668;Okay, first time groomer and more nervous than the dog was.  I've had really bad experiences with cutting dogs nails in the past.  This was so easy to use and worked great!  Easy on the hands, easy to hold and it did not bother the dog!  What more can you ask for?  And the waste catcher was great - no mess!Thank you so much for a great product!;0
107800;I love my dog, I want the best for her, in many cases this food cost more than mine, but she is worth it.  What ever you do find a food your dog likes and has good formed stools.  Then stick with that food and do not change it.  All this is cheaper than vet bills;0
28709;My English bulldog refrains from biting or chewing anything.  But I have to warn you, you must reapply every other day or so :S.;0
36016;Pulling can be a real issue with some dogs and I have an arsenal of alternative devices to deter this behavior. I really like this harness because it essentially turns the dog back into you if it hits resistance and it is my current go-to for walks. I did read in the manual that the effectiveness can diminish in time if you do not follow through with additional training to prevent pulling in conjunction with the harness but I haven't done anything differently and I have still seen a sustained difference. It is kind of confusing to put on so you will want to keep that manual around for a little while to use as reference while you are getting the hang of it. My only issue is that since the loop is on the front of the dog, on the chest, it is a little difficult to use with my preferred leash which has one short loop right at the clip. It creates kind of an awkward length to keep the dog right by your side so that takes a little adjustment.;0
157310;My Muffin thinks these are the best treats ever. She is pretty picky about what she eats, and she begs for these. They take a minute or two for her to consume (she is small @ 14  pounds). I like that they are made in the USA. I will definitely be ordering more.;0
103576;As the weather became colder, I needed something warmer for my 50lb Weimaraner who has very short hair so I did a lot of research and ended up purchasing this for him. He absolutely loves it!!! I placed it in his Midwest 1542 iCrate which is 42x28x30 and it's a perfect fit!! The pillow did come as two adjoining pillows but when you stuff it in the cover it doesn't make a difference. It also has a waterproof side which is great in case of accidents. The pillow case itself is great. It's soooooooo super soft on top and when I try to put a towel over it (to keep it clean), my dog always rips it off because he just loves to lay on the soft cover. We've had it for about 2 months now and I see a little sagging in the middle, which is a bit disappointing but since my dog loves it so much, I wouldn't mind just purchasing another one for him next winter if necessary since it isn't super expensive.;0
106533;Highly digestible, smells great small in size and Ziggy has no problem eating it and made for a yorkie so the brand is conscientious on what a yorkie needs in his diet and his coat, attitude show it;0
16138;I use this to hydrate crickets for my reptiles. The product IS like crushed Jell-O, but doesn't last very long in the cricket container and needs replaced daily. As well, considering the product is mostly water, it is sort of expensive, but I haven't found anything better for the little guys.Its nutritional value is pretty good and is better than using regular water!;0
109517;Not sure how I can really tell if it's working but it seems like it is. It has stuff growing on it.;0
8758;Aquarium filters remove many harmful chemicals, but nitrates do accumulate over time, and the way to remove them is by periodic partial water changes, usually something like 20% per week. The old way was to siphon water out into a bucket, which was dumped down the sink, commode, or in the yard. The bucket was then refilled and poured back into the tank.To change water in this manner was a little bit labor intensive on a small tank, and really time consuming on a larger tank.I stumbled on my pump in a Thrift store, where I found it on a shelf for $1. In all honesty, I'm not 100% sure mine is Lee brand, as it wasn't in the original package, and there is no name on it. It may actually be a knock-off. Mine is made of blue plastic, and looks identical to the item pictured.It operates by connecting it to a water supply, which can be either an outside hose spigot, or by using the adapter, a kitchen faucet.Water flows through from top to bottom, past a venturi located where the side fitting is, creating a suction which will draw water out of the aquarium through a hose. I purchased 50 feet of clear vinyl hose from my local aquarium store, attached it to this device, and put a suction strainer on the other end to avoid sucking small fish into the hose.In use, I drop the suction strainer into the tank, unroll the hose, and attach the pump to the water tap outside my front door. Opening the diverter (the blue collar) on the pump outlet, then turning on the water tap starts a siphon which removes as much water from my tank as I desire (water tap can be closed once siphon starts so long as the pump is lower than the tank, siphon will continue).Closing the diverter on the pump outlet stops the siphon, and opening the water tap with the diverter closed refills the tank.I can't imagine any way to make water changes any easier. I've been using this device for years now, and it still works great.There are also attachments which allow you to vacuum the gravel with the water siphoning out of the tank, if you feel the need to perform this task (I never vacuum because I don't use an undergravel filter, because I use EcoComplete substrate, and because I have fish which eat any food which falls to the bottom, so for me, the need simply isn't there).;0
16551;It is OK . this one will do the trick basic toy and cat will hunt it. before getting this one made one . cat plays better with home made one. but this one will work.;0
7332;Make sure you get medium if you want to use Tennis balls. I prefer the longer handle one, which I use just about every day. The smaller handle one is around if I can't find the other one.;0
94375;I used the tent to get my cat used to being outside without having to worry about her wandering off.  It sets up and folds down easily. The large zippered door makes it easy to put the animal in or take out.  It will blow away in the wind or take off with your animal if you do not tether it down.  I never did attach it to the ground, but I can see where someone might want to if they have a more rambunctious animal.  My Meow-Meow would pretty much just lay in it and watch the world go by.  I don't think the construction would hold up to large animals, but it worked great for my purpose.;0
107288;the clips to go onto the collar are not the ones on the pictures, so I have sent them back. very disappointed as I have been waiting quite a while and really looking for ward to these leashes with my dogs. I hope they send correct replacements rather than the refunds.;0
59870;Pretty simple really, I just put the mat under the litter box so when the cat exits, the excess litter falls into the mat, I shake out the mat once a week and there you have it.;0
77506;"I was hoping that mega-bucks Racael Ray would put out a better dog food then this. Out of the first 10 ingredients, five are terrible and should not be fed to a dog that you love. Chicken Meal,Corn Meal,Soybean Meal,Corn Gluten Meal,Dried Beet Pulp-research these products for yourself, they are the top 5 items that cause allergies and food intolerance in animals among other things-that is 50% of the first ten items.I expected better from Racael Ray! On the plus side however, her ""Just 6"" treats is one of BEST products out there, so I know she has the knowledge to make heathy foods for pets, just not willing to part with her money in her dog food line. My dogs LOVE the Just 6 treats and because they are super good for them I do not mind feeding them the treats but not the food.";0
55402;"I bought the 24"" bed for my 12 pound, 6 month old Havanese puppy.  It's very soft and plush.  He's a rescue (he was slated to be a puppy mill stud dog-- please do NOT buy your dogs from pet stores and promote that horrible practice!!), so he's not used to such comforts.  But he happily climbs into his bed when his ""parents"" are on the couch.  He sometimes likes to lay straight, rather than curled into a ball.  When he does so, he hangs his head outside the bed, rather than on a side bumpers.  But he seems to like that just fine!  We haven't washed it yet, but I like that the bottom bad is removeable for easy cleaning.";0

44595;installation: i have an 08 A4 and the installation was a bit tedious. it seems that most seat covers are not designed for cars smaller than SUVs.touch: every time my dogs would move their paws it would this sound, and after an hour drive it began to sound like nails against a chalkboard.it does its job, but will i order it again, no.;0
114645;I bought the Spotbot Pet because one of our cats pukes practically every day.  The poor guy just can't keep his food down a lot of the time, and we haven't been able to figure out the cause (most of the time it isn't a hairball).To use the machine, first pick up any solid part of the mess.  Then you just make sure the machine has water and cleaning solution in the tank, center the big round brush area over the mess, plug it in, press a  button, and walk away.  About 3-6 minutes later (depending on whether you pressed the button for &#34,fresh&#34, or &#34,set-in&#34,) you can empty and rinse the dirty tank and put the machine away.What I like:- easy to use- no excuse not to clean up the mess right away- works ok on fresh messes- completely automatic: start it and walk away- onboard hose and accessory tool storage works wellWhat I don't like:- doesn't work very well on set-in messes- leaves the floor much wetter than our full-size Hoover Dual-V carpet cleaner- just as noisy as our full-size carpet cleaner- power cord storage works okay, but could be improvedMost of my likes and dislikes above are pretty self-explanatory.  We've tried it with both hot and cold water, and the temperature of the water doesn't seem to make much difference in the machine's ability to clean up a set-in mess.  I'd recommend pretreating with a foaming or spray carpet cleaner if you have a set-in stain.Unfortunately, after using it on the living room carpet, I kept stepping on the spot that had been cleaned, and for more than a day it continued to make my socks wet whenever I stepped on it.A minor gripe is that the power cord storage isn't as good as it could be.  If you wrap the cord in a circle around the two storage pegs, the cord will get twisted and over time will become damaged internally.  It's too difficult to use the over-under cord coiling technique.  If you wrap the cord in a figure-8 around the pegs in an attempt to keep the cord from twisting, it starts to bulge out too much in the middle of the figure-8, and the loops of the figure-8 can come off of the pegs.The Spotbot also has a manual brush, and while it can be somewhat useful for trying to scrub in corners where the spotbot itself can't reach, the manual brush isn't anything special.  But at least it's on par with the other portable spot cleaners.;0
14214;I like this crate.  I bought it for a puppy so really liked that you can divide it as the dog grows;0
100714;My dogs love the duck treats.  Been buying them for several months. A great source of protein. Price on amazon is better than instore.;0
20496;I use this with my 75lb golden retriever.  He's 8 years old and has mostly been a home dog but now we live somewhere with sidewalks so I like to take him out.  It works very well.  Prevents pulling and helps remind him to stay by my side.  He wasn't afraid at all but if we stand around too long he will start pawing at it.  He used one when he was a puppy so it could be that it is familiar to him.  Now every time he sees it he knows it is walk time and goes crazy for a moment, then sits nicely while I put it on.  It was a good purchase.;0
63160;"I got this to replace a dial gauge that came with my ""starter kit for desert animals"" that I bought for my bearded dragon. The dial gauge kept reading around 70% or higher humidity. This one reads 30% and is very quick to adjust to changes.I'm happy with this.";0
141246;This is our 2nd e-collar.  I lost the remote to the 1st one we had (or maybe the dog hid it!).  We do a lot of off-leash walking, running, bike riding with our dog.  He's good 90% of the time but for that 10% when he picks up a scent or decides to bolt... this allows me to give him a buzz and knock his mind off whatever he's chasing.  I also use it for general training.  The 'vibration' button is typically all he needs.  Just a gentle reminder.  But if I need to buzz with more emphasis, this does that too.Pros:-Vibration button-Set up (can be confusing but once you read the instructions and understand how it works, it's great)-Customization of the 'shock' intensity and the 'boost' intensity.-The light feature is awesome!  Our neighborhood does not have sidewalks so from the remote I can light up our dog's collar and it's bright!  Great if you don't know where your pooch is at night too.-Range.  Not sure how far this really goes but in general 3/4 of a mile is really far.  Our pooch has been pretty far away and I know this has worked every time so far.Cons:The size of the remote is just a little large for me.  If you're holding it in your hand all the time it's very well setup.  But I like to carry it in my pocket and it's a little big. Not too big though (still fits in my pants pocket).  This is a minor complaint.Overall:Great product.;0
148469;Well I had to send it back because someone tagged the toy as size Medium. I have a Yorkie and the toy was the same size as his head. I have reordered another. Hope it is the right size.;0
122442;My puppy got a tick when he first got here. I got this and he hasn't had any fleas, or even a single tick. I live in Atlanta, and it's almost June and the fleas and ticks are abundant so this is very impressive. I was told to get FrontLine by the shelter that I got him from, but decided I'd try this instead.I'm a believer and I'll most certainly be getting it again. I HAVE heard that it's not always effective. My dog is black and it's working great for him, but if you have a light colored dog that fleas like more, you may find it's not as effective as some other brands.ADDED:We went hiking in the woods for his 6 month half birthday and were also around quite a few other dogs. He came back with fleas :( In defense of the product, his weight is right on the edge of the proper weight for the medication because he grew faster than I expected (shelter told me wrong mix of breeds) and I didn't want to buy more medicine. I'll be getting the proper weight size and using this again... it was working so well until we went into the woods, and his weight is right on the maximum of the weight.. so it might be too weak now.;0
133886;Works great! Keeps my dog in his seat, out of my face, and not jumping out the window. That was my main intent and for that it's perfect. :)But I am skeptical how well it would protect him in an actual crash. It's paired with a &#34,car safe&#34, harness, but the metal on the actual seat belt doesn't seem very trustworthy to hold even my 55 lb Aussie. I wouldn't trust it for anything bigger, for sure.Also don't let your chewer get to it, obviously! He chewed right through the nylon of the first belt but hasn't messed with the second one because I'm careful to not leave him in the car with it. :);0
18050;Spud loves this stuff. Whenever he hears the bag, he comes begging for some, it's very cute. I do not like the recommendation they give on the bag to give 1-2 teaspoons daily. There are raisins and other sugary items in this &#34,cocktail&#34, that will upset a chinchilla's sensitive digestive system if given more quantity that he really needs. I generally give about 1-2 pieces during Spud's playtime and both of us are happy with that arrangement.;0

80118;When I first purchased the Green Killing Machine 3 watt uv sterilizer it worked fine.  It's cheaply made, however, given its price, this is to be expected.I am using this unit on a 20 gallon long tank, which is at the maximum of this uv sterilizer's rating.What is strange is that the red light on the control box which contains the electronics for the uv sterilizer lamp, is still on.  However, when the water becomes cloudy and I place the unit in my aquarium to clear the water, it remains murky even after running for several days.The problem must be with the uv bulb, which would mean that the circuitry in the electronic's box is not functioning properly, since if the bulb were out, the red light on the box should be off.However, since the red light is still on, yet the water is not clearing, perhaps the bulb is no longer operating within the spectrum it was designed for.If this is the case, then given that I have only used this unit in my aquarium a few times, this would relate to a quality control issue.As a stand alone powerhead, the unit works quite well, and is very cleverly designed, with the power head and uv sterilizer lamp having separate mains plugs.As such, once the bulb fails you can simply cut the wire from the lamp portion of this unit and still use it as a powerhead, or just toss the lamp and purchase a new one, which you then attach to the powerhead.Or for about $10 more, buy an entire unit.It's just unfortunate that there appears to be a quality control issue here, since the unit only functioned for a brief time.;0
110471;My dog(pitbull)  loved it. Only he figure it out how to destroy so now I have rubber all over the floor. But  hey if he's happy then I'm happy. It last him like 4 hours, which is more then I expected. Usually he eats a big pork bone in less then an hour so for a toy it's more then enough.;0
112120;They go flat fast. You have to go to the store and buy a couple of bags of poly-fil and puff it back up after about a week. But overall it's pretty awesome for my Rhodesian Ridgeback and Retriever.;0
81715;I love this item. It is bigger than you think it would be but really, not a nuisance. Changing the litter box has never been easier. ALSO it really, truly does keep the smell OUT. I love it!;0
65728;As stated, if you read the instructions, it goes together very quickly. The door I put it on is mostly glass with a wood frame. It's a bit of a hassle to open and close the door but it's worth it for observing the cats through the glass. This comes with all the tools you need to put it together. My only gripe might be the strong smell of the carpet glue but that's fading and the cats didn't seem to mind. I have a small, cat rescue and the cats are kept in kennels and let out to play.

76983;I got this little condo for my kitten who was too little to stay out with the big boys and had to stay alone in the bathroom during the day.  9 months later she still plays with the toy on top, scratches on it and routinely knocks it over and rolls it around the bedroom. Her Mother plays with it too. They're still small and sometimes crawl inside.  I got it for a temporary problem but this little condo is much tougher and better built than it looks in the description pictures. It remains a good toy even though its purpose was well served a while ago.;0
87867;The mattress fits an extra large crate.  It has a rubber pad on the other side so it doesn't slip around in the crate.  However, after having it spin in a washing machine, dog hair sticks on the rubber pad and gets clustered around the tufts on the front.  The hair won't fall off in the dryer either, so you have to swipe them off by hand.;0
149398;This harness & leash system was recommended by our puppy trainer, & it has been great!  Latches on both ends of the leash provide various ways for the leash to be attached to the harness, giving us much more control of our Labrador.

107840;It appears all items such as this from this company, are made in China.  With the long history of China's toxic issues with pet food and children's toys, do we really want to give our adored pets something to chew on for days, that is poisonous?  Do we want to take that chance with our littlest, most susceptible family members?My issue is that it was not disclosed in the ad.  These things are expensive and to pay for something that has such potential for harm is wrong.  What guarantees we have?;0
81884;I have an older cat who needs to drink alot of water for his kidneys.  I found he was always putting his paw in the water dispenser and either splashing or draggging the whole thing across the room, spilling water along the way. Sometimes he tried to drink from the toilet. In any case, it was clear he wasn't happy with his water.  Since I've gotten this, he no longer tries to paw or drag it at all!  He drinks from where the water spout, while my other cat prefers to drink from the trough.  We have very good tap water, so I only change out the water once a week and when I do so, there hasn't been much to clean. I'm also only changing the filter every month and am going to try cracking one open and refilling with my own charcoal. You have to get used to the humm of the filter and a little water splash noise but other than that it is great!  I don't think the stainless version is worth it.  It is just prettier but has all the same inner parts.;0

148894;The only thing I would like to see added to these....  Would be a 'tail' hole.  I'm going to add them myself but would be nice to see that already done.  They are light weight, yet, they do the trick.  Thank you!;0
108634;This is a nice cat pan.  It is large enough for my 9lb cat to move around.  The door helps to keep mess inside.  I also like that I can lift the door to clean easily.  I wish it can with a scooper, but thats no big deal.;0
121584;I'm sold on this limited ingredient dog food.The ingredients are :Lamb meal, which contains more protein than fresh lambBrown riceGround rice, or rice flourbeet pulppoultry fatCompared to other dog foods, this one does seem more healthy.Different breeds of dogs do have different nutritional needs, some need more protein than others, ect.My dogs love the flavor and eat it very readily.This dog food is made in the USA, which is also very nice. Since my dogs love it and my vet approves, I'm considering switching over to this food.;0
122351;This is the only treat that will keep my American Eskimo puppy entertained for any length of time. Each bully stick lasts him about 4 days, so the price on these is great compared to in stores, especially since these are made in the USA. I wouldn't purchase the Chinese or Indian-made bully sticks, I'm too afraid they will make my dog sick.;0
118438;Nice little addition to the cage. Can't say whether or not they play with it much but it's nice and colorful. Lol.;0
24492;My one dog has very thick hair and has dandruff issues. I used this twice and it has made a really nice difference. Cannot wait to see what a few more washes will do.;0
70739;...I have a feeling the can I opened the other day had mold.  Just to be clear, I have been buying Natural Balance on/off for MANY years. My cats love it. Its a decent food compared to the garbage like Purina etc.  I have bought my canned cases of Natural Balance from Amazon and many other companies before. I usually buy by what is cheapest.  That being said, I opened this can up and about a quarter sized area near the snap tab was green. I emailed some pictures to Natural Balance and chatted online with Amazon. Amazon seemed more concerned than Natural Balance. Amazon offered a refund right away or a replacement if I wanted to go that route. They also asked I report back to let them know what Natural Balance says to me. (To be honest, it didnt seem like the rep at Natural Balance, when she called back, was overly concerned about what I discovered in the can which makes me hesitate buying their food anymore). Amazon even said I could return the other 4 cases of food I bought. Since this is an isolated issue, I will keep the other cases of food, not use the cans in the case where the moldy food came from and rethink Natural Balance as my cat's wet food choice in the future).  I am happy though that Amazon took the initiative and responsibility as to the remainder of the food I have.;0
69204;Item as described. This filter is pretty much almost the cheapest one I can find on amazon, it is quiet and doesn't take up much space. I have it on my 1g tank is it works well.;0
17703;My cats seem to like them fine but they don't hold together very well. I am constantly vacuuming pieces up that have broken off.;0
121023;Love the item. I wish the bag would last longer. So it a price of convenience, or how many store bags who have. Or even trying gallon size zip locks, messy. Until you get the hang of it. They must be the very cheap dollar store ones. Cost, is an issue, with how workable. Me I will buy the product, when I have the money too. And of course I will substitute the bag issue as need. Rightnow with 2 kittens I would like the bag liner last a least a month. Just me.;0
61755;These bowls are very cute and the small version was a lot larger than I expected. They feel really sturdy and the designs have stayed on after washing. My only problem would be that the little pieces on the bottom (the &#34,feet&#34, to keep it from banging/sliding) came off after the first time it was washed but not a huge problem for me. I would buy them again :);0
49123;These are one of the few dog treats my dogs will chew for awhile and their breath still smells decent after they finish.  The ends on these are bumpy so I assume they are helping to keep their teeth as nice and white as they are.  I buy the regular size and for the golden retriever I feed these to, they last awhile.  I have bought these a few times and will continue to buy them.;0
66749;I gave it three stars because it's good quality but the sizing is off. The site said &#34,XS fits 8&#34, length, 10-12&#34, neck, 12-16&#34, chest&#34,There is no way. It's very small. My 6lber has 9in neck and 13 chest. This thing was skin tight. Plus...what dog with a 16in chest needs an 8 inch sweater? Poor little thing would be round. It's feet probably don't even touch the floor.;0
134539;This is basically just an open celled yoga mat, for a littler box.  I had high hopes, but one sick cat peed on it and the smell did not wash out, instead it got absorbed by the mat.  Also, their claws definitely scratched it up.  Maybe if it was more attractive and made in nicer colors with no patterns or better ones I would consider repurchasing.  I'm thinking of just buying a cheap yoga mat and using that instead.;0
85976;It is really hard to rate dog food because I am not the one eating it.My dog is used to Purina One...  lamb or chicken.Beneful is much more colorful.  It doesn't have a particular odor.  It is softer than the food I am used to.  My mixed terrier has been slow to take to this.  This may say more about my dog than the Beneful...  He loves treats and I was sure he would see this as a treat with all the shapes and colors (ok...dogs are color blind but)I think dogs are slow to change what they are used to so I wouldn't take this as meaning your dog won't like Beneful.  Nutritionally, it looks like it is good but I can't tell how much of that is marketing.I'll revise if our dog seems to acclimate more to this.;0
85082;Base is not large enough - have to fill it 2x a day or it starts to make sucking noises, and would eventually cause the pump to fail.;0
11938;Works great! Pretty much just what I was expecting. There is even a guard on them so you don't cut too much of the nail.;0
83894;It's off-leash time in the local parks after 9pm and my big dog and I go often. She is VERY ball-motivated, and with this bright glowing orb I always know exactly where she is. In combo with the L.E.D. collar tag we got her, so does every one else in the park (which I think is a good thing). One obsessed dog did try to steal it from her once, and in the process bit straight through her lip to try to take it from her mouth and wouldn't let go. So beware the envious pooch.;0
79540;They like it best after I spray it with catnip spray!!!  Cute little toy though!  It holds together better than a lot of other toys I have brought for my little monsters!!  LOL;0
80878;I'm not one to leave negative reviews but I have to on this one. I've tried this food on all of my tanks and even the pond outside, my fish just won't eat it! Maybe their spoiled...I feed them premium flakes, shrimp along with a variety of veggies and worms so maybe that's it...but ordinarily my pond fish will eat anything (including fingers) but they spit this out.;0
65329;My cats love this food.I've bought it for years and it does not upset their stomachs.It smells almost good enough to eat!;0
55982;I bought this for my granddaughter to use on her pony. She tells me it has become quite the hit at the stables and all the girls want one for their ponies. She also says the pony loves to be groomed with the tool and remains very quiet during the process.;0
109510;I have a collection of really beautiful show quality Bettas, most of which are imported from Thailand.  These Bettas have really huge, heavy fins.  It's very important that the water flow in the aquarium not batter my fish around.  After trying several aquariums and being disappointed, I bought a Fluval Chi.  It worked perfectly!  I now have 7 Fluval Chi aquariums.  I love them.They have two negatives.  Because of the open top, the water evaporates fairly quickly.  The other problem is that my cats think the water fountain on the top is delicious.  They help make the water disappear.;0
121235;Frontline stopped working completely, and both of our cats had a lot of fleas while we waited until enough time had passed to apply Advantage. The day after I applied it, dead fleas were literally falling off of our cats and have been under control ever since.;0
68026;I purchased this product to minimize my dogs' gas and soft stool problem. The first batch was quickly used. However, one of my dogs dislike the smell and gradually avoided the food mixed with the product. Now, I occassionally add a packet to their meals.;0
51746;This is the third wubba toy I buy, the first two went to my older dog who even as a puppy was not a very destructive chewer and it took her months to destroy this toy. The most recent one I bought did not fare as well and was destroyed in about 30 minutes. It didn't turn out too badly because then I ended up with two toys, a very sturdy chewy, squeaky ball and a raggedy octopus which is great for fetching. So while I don't recommend letting heavy chewers continuous access to this toy, for dogs that are not destructive it should last a nice while and be fun for them.;0
118454;I purchased this Filter though Amazon and received it in just a flash shipping in less than five days! I've had a really bad green algae, cloudy water and worse, you name it and this Filter is a miracle that solves my problems. I used to make a frequently water changes almost every week, some time every two days and spent a lot of money for Chemical treatments with the resulted of my fishes dying in peace! now I have not changed my tank's water for over two months since I've got this Filter. Thanks a lot Aquatop! I think of buying another spare one just in case this product is being discontinued or something! Very comparable and over performed to those expensive ones on the the market today. I'd love to see many hobbies recognized this product.;0
45864;They work fairly well.. not much else to say. If you have fat fingers maybe skip them, because the holes to hold on to are very small, but I have relatively large hands and manage to use them with no problem.;0
11103;This tool works great to get out loose cat hair and you can use the flat side to scrape hair ofd the furniture too. We had one for many years and it finally got so awful we replaced it, they never really wear out but after ten or twelve years we noticed the rubbery material was just not quite the way it should be. An excellent investment and tool!;0
95216;Really nice product but not big enough for 3 lb yorkie puppy. I would recommend it for any tiny pups for sure.;0
17122;When Princess entered my life, I had to purchase a lot of cat-accessories. All my other cats had to do with whatever was in the house, but this cat I got from the SPCA, and wanted to give her a bit better standard. So I got two, one for her water, and one for her food.What I didn't realise was that my little kitty likes wet food more than dry, but also wants dry food. So I am one bowl short.The base is very stable, sits on the ground very well. The little kitty doesn't manage to push it around much. The stainless steel bowl comes off, so it makes it easy to clean. It's not very big, but neither is my little kitty, so that makes it just perfect for a cat.Edit: I did actually get another one of these. My cats eating tray looks very elegant!;0
24645;My dog had no problems eating it. I guess corn syrup being the first ingredient helped with that. HA. My dog was diagnosed as slightly anemic from stomach ulcers from taking a steroid for his shoulder. I decided giving this to him was a little easier on his stomach than feeding him ground beef. He ate this with his dog food and within a week or so, he got most of his energy back, going on full walks again. I only put him on this for 2 bottles worth and he's been fine since then.;0
120045;Nice to have a package of three.  They came quickly and my local pet outlet doesn't always have these in stock.  The price is OK too.;0
106743;I have tried Four Paws Wee-Wee pads, Dynarex Under pads(worst),Simply Right Super Absorbent under pads(very good-still use) and Natures Miracle Advanced Wee Pads(still use)and find Natures Miracle Advanced Ultra is the best by far for doggie wee pads! I have (2) 4-lb puppies that share the same pads and I am impressed on how absorbent Natures Miracle Advanced turned out to be. They claim to hold 6 cups of liquid and I believe it, this is the only pad with Polymer in it, Polymer helps absorption and keeps the spread of the liquid to a minimum getting more use out of the pad, this pad is also fantastic at keeping odor absorbed. The funny thing is I bought this brand on accident, 50pads for $39 bucks at Petsmart which I find is the only place I can get these pads in-store in my area. The pad size is larger than the other pads 27x23, the others are 23x24 and Natures are truly the closest pad to the usable size stated on the package, the other pads can be up to 4inches smaller in usable area size(so your 23x24 pad is actually 19x21 inches)because the blue border is non-absorbent and not usable(Dynarex brand)!! I just bought Natures Miracle Advanced Ultra on sale at Petsmart, 100pads for $39 which is a great price but I only use these in my crate due to that high price. For daily use, I go with Simply Right Super Absorbent 23x36 under pads from Sam's club which is also very very good and not bad at keeping odor at bay with a very very cheap price tag, 120pads for $24 plus they are sold in-store, no need to order online. I put these 23x36 pads on top of crate replacement trays $14 bucks on sale at Petco free shipping at the time to help keep the urine for spilling when they use the edge of the pads. Even the Natures Miracle doesn't stop the half on half off the pad and you have to agree you can't catch them every time. I would def recommend these pads I am very happy with them, just wish the price would come down.;0
87538;Bought this as a Christmas present for my spoiled Cockatoo. I wrapped it and hung it on his play gym. He had a great time shredding the paper Christmas morning. Then he discovered the toy! He hasn't left it alone since then. Usually a toy lasts him 2 or 3 days, but this one has so much to it that he is still enjoying it.;0
15274;I have two cats that love catnip.  I grow it in the garden for them, and now I'm growing this in the house this winter.  It came right up in four days.  I covered the dish with plastic until it started and as soon as it had two sets of leaves I transplanted three or four  of them into small cups.  They now have many leaves.  I give each cat several leaves two or three times a day.;0
136621;I like this product. It's most definitely a five star one. The price is right, too! The size of the grip feels perfect for both me (I've got relatively small hands) and my husband. We've also had no problems with the buttons, everything works fine.;0
157011;It smells fantastic, nd seems to work well. I just dab some on a cotton ball, stuff the ball into my cat's and dog's ears and just sqeeze it gently.;0
2324;I had to put my Golden retreiver on a diet as he is getting old and his hips are giving out.I have been using this product for about a year and it has provided some improvements in dog's weight.I don't think he likes it as much the more fattening moist food I was feeding him, but he has gotten used to it.Honestly, I sometimes sweeten his dish with some home cooked chicken ( skinless, boneless and de-fatted).;0
152034;She goes to town on these things and distracts her for a long time. It is one of the few things she really destroys so it is good to keep her from chewing other things.;0
39687;I am tired of junk food dog treats. I dont want artificial colors, flavors, dyes, corn. I love subscribe and save from Amazon, great idea. My first shipment arrived today. My dog was very curious about the box, couldnt quit smelling it. I opened one bag, she was very excited. Yum, she loves them. Healthy ingredient list. Good product.;0
96775;my puppy doesn't chew on it for whatever reason.  maybe its too heavy or maybe its cause its not flavored but the product itself is very well made;0
112086;My 12 year old 30 pound terrier climbed right onto it even though she has the option of laying on my bed or the couch, then my nine month old Boxer kept trying to bully her off of it, or sneak a nap even though she typically stretches out on the couch.  Sooooo.......I ordered a large bed a few minutes ago for my growing Boxer while my aging terrier snoozes away!  Gosh, I might even get my couch and bed back for myself!!;0
118393;"...To start positive, the price was fair, close to the others I'd checked out. This test also ~claims~ to have the largest data base of dogs, a little over 170. Some of the others have much less, as little as 60 breeds or less in their database, but claim those 60 breeds represent 92%+ of all dogs....Digression: I don't know enough to confirm or criticize either claim about breed numbers. Wikipedia (not the most expert source, but at least ""a"" half-way reputable one) only says there are ""hundreds"" of variations, and that the dog is the most variable land mammal. I suppose it depends what you decide makes a difference. I saw other claims that the total number of dog breeds was upwards of 5000. With a claimed population (worldwide) of over 400 million dogs (more than all the people in the US), that would allow for about 80,000 of each breed if they all had equal size populations.  but I went with the higher numbers. End of digression....Collecting the sample was easy. Two glorified Q-tips were enclosed, I swabbed each one around the dog's mouth sufficiently after he ate, so no food particles would contaminate the samples, put each in a tube to air dry, and then sealed and mailed them in the pre-paid envelope. No other costs to mail, to buy a mailer, to pay for processing, just the one cost to buy the kit. Okay, and a quarter for parking at the post office. If you drop your sample in a mail box, you can avoid that....Speed of acknowledgement of receipt was good, within several days, and speed of the report was also good, within 1-2 weeks of that. I wasn't in a hurry. I'm not going to quibble about the report coming by email, directing me to the site, where I downloaded the report as a pdf file, instead of sending the report by regular snail-mail. I was still able to get it in usable form and save it to reprint if necessary....The actual report was where they get docked a few points. The dog is identified by EVERYBODY (vets, neighbors, dozens of strangers, trainers, beach goers, a police officer,)as a pit bull. I figured that, as a stray, he could have some other stuff mixed in, so I wasn't expecting Aryan type purity. The report says he's only 1/4 ""Am.Staff"" (American Staffordshire is the commonly used fancy name for pit bulls), 1/4 Rottweiler, 1/4 ""mixed breed"" and 1/4 Whippet. I was a little disappointed that the 1/4 ""mixed"" couldn't be broken down further, apparently the test can only discriminate up to 25%, but would not show meaningful results if the dog was 24% or less of something. That part, and the ""whippet"" gave me a laugh. This dog is built like a Sherman tank: he has a huge block head with a huge neck, even bigger than mine, a super solid chest like a mastiff, and is close to 90 pounds, there is no way he has Whippet in him unless he ate one. (A Whippet is basically a scrawnier version (15-30 pounds) of the already thin greyhound. Apologies to Whippet/greyhound owners, I'm just trying to give a picture of my dog, not to insult theirs. I've seen some beautiful Whippets and greyhounds. Thinner dogs can run faster since they weigh less.)I'm not going to argue vociferously about the Rottweiler part, that may be true. At least it's a roughly similar build to an Am.Staff....Overall, if I have to wonder about the accuracy of the test, the other factors (cost, speed, number of breeds) don't really matter. I'm not really interested in sending in another sample from another address under another name. So, probably not the best test out there. I'll have to research some more before trying it again.";0
140775;We'd tried several vet recommended foods for our cat, but he still had digestive issues and would throw up several times a week.  His teeth were getting bad and his breath and whole body was putting of a bad odor.  I decided to try and find a food on my own, so I started reading reviews on Amazon and came across Instinct and decided to give it a try.  It's made all the difference.  He hasn't thrown up once, he smells 99% better, and he has so much more energy.  No more grains for our cat, ever.;0
42125;This item is made of wood.  4 of the wooden blocks were badly damaged.This could be hazardous to my birds.  They could be hurt by playing with this toy.This is one of the disadvantages of buying online.  They send you any old crap because you cannot inspect the item.I will just put it where it belongs in the trash, super bird creations.;0
19324;I do not mean to sound uncaring....I love my pup's....I cut a bunch open, no hairs.....and besides, many pup's turn around and take a nice bite of their own poop! Vet's say it is normal but I broke my one pup of heading back for a sneak treat.....plus, every pup laps/ licks their bung hole until they are satisfied it is clean! When my pup's come in I use Cottonelle Wet Wipes on each one as I do not want any brown circles or little brown spec's on my floors.....plus, if you were not nearby and your pup came across a 2/3 day old road kill , you know your pup is headed over for a sniff, possible lick and ugh! A possible bite! Canines are curious, smart, loyal, loving buddies. If you really want to help your pup's, get some butt wipes and you will be shocked at how much canine fecal matter you will prevent from falling off around your house. The hair thing in the treat is nothing compared to letting your canine bud lick his anus clean!;0
994;After reading the negative reviews about broken teeth and other issues, I'm kind of relieved that none of my dogs have shown any interest in this chew.  I even tried coating it with yummy stuff (peanut butter, etc.) to get my dogs to take interest, but they'll only lick the coating off and then leave the chew.  My dogs are all mixes of German Shepherd, Rottweiler, Pit Bull, and Border Collie, so it should say something that they will have nothing to do with this item.  I'm tired of stubbing my toe on it after having it around the house unused for over a year.  It's going in the trash.;0
83771;The dimensions of these pads are roughly the same size as the average kitchen rug/mat that goes in front of the sink.I wouldn't exactly call them X large though.  they're the same width as the smaller size but these are just longer in length which is kinda silly because dogs usually walk around in circles before they do their business.A larger square pad would be better and it would make more sense.I wouldn't recommend them.  I know there are larger, square pads out there because I've purchased them before, but I can't remember who made them.They don't hold urine well either.  I'm still mopping up pee that seeps under them.;0
140615;I had my doubts at first because of my finicky eaters, but my cats love this stuff.  This is the only flavor pack I've tried, they seem to like fishy food best, and it's a pate topped with tiny shreds of tuna.;0
98068;I ordered this as recommended by a bulldog health forum & soon enough my Frenchie hurt his head from playing roughly & hitting his head on the sharp edge of the coffee table. I cleaned up his wound & sprayed Vetericyn & it dried the wound overnight!I love this product & think it's a must-have for any dog mom.;0
145495;My cats love this , I got it to sit in front of the windows and they will sit and bird watch or sleep .;0
111042;Nice cage if I ever needed one-can divide it in half and use for two cats if necessary.Nice furniture appeal.I bought it so I could put my queen cat in it for like two days every two weeks without getting her spaded but she would not go along with me so I ended up spading her;0
58933;Cat loves this and this package actually lasted awhile :-)  I'm not crazy about the pull apart pole though.;0
13807;I guess because of the shape it's easy for the dog to chew a sharp edge into the bone.  It was so sharp I was afraid the dog's would cut their gums.  The other shaped Nylabones are a better choice than this one.;0
104993;I am SO glad I bought this!! We have 2 cats and were doing well to keep up their water bowls, but sometimes we'd come home and see it dry and they'd be meowing their little heads off. Well, the guilt set in!! I even used a bigger bowl sometimes 2...but sometime's they'd play with the water, the bowls would get tipped when they were running around chasing each other (hehe)...and my one finicky girl...sometimes she'd get a kibble in her water and she won't drink the water if there's anything in it...including an ant that decided to climb in once *yuck*. This solved the problem!! I love it because it keeps the water fresh and clean inside the dispenser and they can drink as much as they want, and they'll always be guaranteed to get clean fresh water coming out. It lasts, and we refill it when it gets down to 1/4 full.  We wipe the dish clean with soap and water once a week..to keep it from getting water scale deposits etc.  This is a great pet waterer  at a great price!!! It's also PERFECT for when we have to go out of town for a day or 2...we know they won't run out of water or accidentlly knock their bowls over. (we have the matching food dispenser as well) They look SO sleek side by side! THANKS SO MUCH!;0
41246;My cat loves to bunny-kick the crap out of this one. He seems to really enjoy Yeowww products more than any other brands, as these are the ones I see him consistently playing with. He has the cigar, the rainbow and the banana as well but seems to like this one the best (it is also the largest).Definitely worth the price and they really do hold up well after months and months of happy bunny kicks!;0
11600;This must have one great taste, because the ferrets love it!! It is made from good products and a known name brand!;0
53538;We've had our dog for 2 years. We went to the vet multiple times and we were told it's allergies. She constantly was scratching her paws and her back by her her tail( I mean there wasn't a second in the day that she wasn't scratching). They made me pay for steroid pills that did nothing and since she hasn't left a mark or taken out hair then it wasn't an issue to them. I used this product once and for the past week I haven't seen her scratch once. I'm going to use it weekly. So glad I found something so simple that works so well.;0
111071;I treat my animal's health as if it were my own and try to not only find the best veterinarian care, but also the best foods.  I've had my dog Brandy on Eagle brand dog food for many years.  I remember when there was the melanine scare, but I didn't have to worry because all of the ingredients were natural and were grown in the United States.  Aside from that, once I changed from an inexpensive food with suspect ingredients, there was a very noticeable difference in her general appearance, especially her fur.  It became sleek and ultra shiny and her body slim and trim.Brandy is now eleven years old and although I cannot credit Eagle for her health, she has had only one minor incident that she's had to be taken to the vet's for outside of regular checkups.  My veterinarian wholeheartedly approves of her diet and is pleased that even though she's getting to be an old girl, she's amazingly healthy.  I used to use another Eagle brand, but since she's getting older,  I switched to the senior brand.  She's getting a tad chunky, but her activity level has changed.  Brandy still is frisky and I do believe a good diet has a lot to do with it.When my vet called me the other day with some test results from another dog, I asked her about the corn in this food.  Everyone is yelling about corn being a poor and unhealthy filler so I couldn't resist asking.  She simply said that she considered corn a vegetable and had little bad to say about it.

To transition, gradually mix in the new food over a 5-7 day period, increasing the amount of Eagle Pack each day, so that you are feeding 100% Eagle Pack by day 7.Determining Feeding PortionsLooking at the chart, divide the total cups per day by the total number of times you feed your dog per day to determine the portion size for each meal. Keep a clean bowl of fresh water available at all times. Eagle Pack believes in feeding dry and wet food in combination whenever possible to help increase the level of water in your dog's diet.Recommended Feeding Portions(based on a standard 8 oz dry measuring cup)Every dog is different so optimal feeding amounts may vary with age, size, activity level, breed and environment. Please use this information as an initial recommendation only and adjust as needed.WEIGHT OF DOG DAILY FEEDINGLbs.

53821;This is certainly an easy way --- tho somewhat expensive in the long run --- to give pills.  Unfortunately I have an old dog that takes a number of pills twice a day so I use 4-5 of these a day.  Liver sausage works well but is very messy.;0
67221;I love this food scoop. It's beautiful, stylish, and well sized. My only beef with this is that it does not have any measurement markings, it would be perfect if it had the markings on the inside so I know how much dog food I've scooped out. However, I just measured in a measuring cup, poured that amount in the scoop and then used a sharpie to mark that amount. Works great for me :);0
14333;It will be the adult kennel one day. The only thing I do not like is that the side gate and movable barrier do not allow me to place two smaller pups one on each side.;0
118758;My dog loves this vegan food. The only downside to this food, is it isn't easy to mix in with dry food as it's one solid consistency. If you're looking for something to mix in with dry food, try Natures Recipe healthy skin vegetarian, which has more &#34,sauce&#34,.;0
37118;(I am NOT rating the vendor - just the ball)In brief these balls from Kong are not of the quality and durability they use to be.  I still have some of the old design and I purchase some new ones.. MAJOR disappointment!The original had thicker sides, and the squeaker was not easy to remove.  I have some in the yard that where hit by my tractor and they are in better shape than the ones just received and chewed on for a while.I WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.  Goodbye Kong.;0
105642;Anyone who has a cat, no matter how well behaved, how well litter trained...they'll have accidents every now and then. Nature's miracle is...well...a miracle when it comes to breaking down the enzymes in animal waste...this one, made specifically for cat urine, is a godsend for those of us with purr-babies. It can be used to clean floors, rugs, around the box, you can even toss some in laundry that's been soiled. If you have a kitty, keep this in your closet just in case. It's an awesome product, one that as long as I have a cat, I'll have a bottle of.;0
91503;My cat begs for thsi food! We give him a quater of a can ever 12 hours. The cat loves the taste and begs for more when he is finished with his portion. It''s a good value. And convient, so you don't have to go to the store and stand in line to get 24 cans of act food cause this is delivered right to your door. My cat is happy!;0
77954;I have to admit I am overall pleased with this. My Boxer has black nails, and I hate cutting them becuase I can't see his quick. It runs on C batteries, c'mon who uses C batteries anymore, but other than that it is powerful enough for my dog's nails without being harsh. It didn't freak my dog out, he just doesn't like holding still. It doesn't hurt the dog, and its easy enough that I can get my husband to do the dogs nails with this. I would have to say, atleast for right now, that this is worth buying and was a good investment for us.;0
126283;Sometimes it did the job-sometimes my dog could not have cared less!;0

149473;We also own the Wahl men's groomer which also comes with many attachments in a bag, this groomer is similar and does a decent job. It takes a few passes but it grooms my dog better than some other products I have tried and is reasonably priced. My dog goes crazy when you switch on a hair dryer or electrical product so he was scared of it at first but calmed down as this is not too loud.It came with a pair of scissors that are very useful for trimming. Most combs and attachments are not really needed unless one has dogs with multiple coat lengths. The apron was nice as dog hair tends to get everywhere and it's nice to have one dedicated to grooming. The kit box is nice too so everything can stay in place.;0
82479;I bought these for a Cavalier with awful teeth!  I was told she needed to have 1/3 of her teeth pulled.  We started alternating these with the VeggieDent chews of the same brand.  Things are better!!She loves them and they are thin - chew right down to soft.;0
102198;"Probably a good toy for a less powerful chewer. My dog was able to detach the top of the toy within twenty minutes. Would still screw back on (badly), but once he figured it out, it was kind of a waste. Ended up just being a more expensive way to put food in a bowl for him.Update: Decided to give it a second try (first one got knocked off a balcony and smashed) Still kind of easy for the dog to open it, if you don't close it very well, and sometimes if you do. Doesn't really ""wobble"" well, the bottom doesn't seem heavy enough and so it tends to lay on its side and get pushed around (like an omega ball or buster cube--which I liked much more). Also dog has managed to cover it with toothmarks, which make sharp chunks of plastic that he cuts his nose on when he tries to use it. After a few weeks he is just kind of ignoring it (even when its full and he's hungry).  So, again, would probably work better for a different type of dog.";0
11960;Literally, it fits in the hand nicely. Better than the little pair I used to have (and subsequently lost in my move).;0
61690;I was looking for something high in protein with minimal corn and byproducts for my new kitten, but it's hard to find it at a low price. However, I was willing to pay a bit extra to make sure my kitty was getting an appropriate diet. This was a great find. I got a 7lb bag on sale at PetSmart for $15, which I considered a great price, especially for higher quality food. My cat absolutely loves it and gobbles it up as soon as I put it in his bowl. I've noticed a lot less shedding and his coat and soft and shiny. My only complaint is that it makes his poop stink to high heaven! I have a feeling that's a product of any high protein diet, though, so I'm not sure I can do much more about that.All in all, though, I think this is a great find and a good price!;0
94082;"I bought the OSTER GENTLE PAWS CORDLESS NAIL TRIMMER because I wanted to keep my Shiba Inu puppy's nails from getting too long. However after testing it out on her, I'll be sending the product back.It comes with the motor, 2 drill heads, 2 files that cover one of the drill heads, and cover guard. There's also a pamphlet on how to use the product with bare bones information. You have to supply the 4 ""AA"" batteries, which are easy to install.So I get the OSTER NAIL TRIMMER set up, let my puppy get used to the trimmer and the sound it makes, and then go to work on her front paws. When I finally get one of her nails into the cover guard it doesn't touch the grinding head so I move up to the next size. That goes in and it starts to grind but the sensation freaks my Shiba out. And it was awkward trying to trim the nail down with the guard on because it was hard to move the trimmer in an angle.I try to reassure her and turn off the TRIMMER, but she's having none of it, jumping and squirming to and fro. Finally she calms down a bit and I try for round two. This time I turn the switch to ""on"" and it doesn't turn on! I had to shake it, turn it back to ""off"" and then turn it back on again. Finally it starts up and as soon as I get a nail touching the grinding surface, my Shiba is now contorting her whole body to get away from the thing, she loses it again, freaking out with such gusto that I'm afraid she's going to break her own arms off to get away. Finally I gave up.This product might work for some doggie parents but it didn't work for me. I'm going to try the old fashioned nail clippers next.";0
150158;These bags do their job, fit into most waste bag dispensers, and have held up pretty well. I have yet to have had any issues with tearing them off one another or starting a new roll. They are not incredibly thick so if you have some issues touching dog waste through a thinner-feeling surface this product might not be for you. Amazon's price was quite the bargain!;0
47531;I'm not sure about the peach flavor - boyfriend tasted them and it wasn't appealing and the dogs can't quite comment on them. But they still chase them like crazy! They are more 'indestructible' when it comes to popping, but be warned.... if you blow these in the livingroom, you will have random bubbles that haven't popped on all of your surfaces haha. That is what makes it fun because the dogs go around popping them. It does end up on their coats too, but a little wet napkin gets it off no problem. Definitely worth it because they have so much fun chasing them around. Probably best outside.;0
22432;I had a Larson storm door that had a petsafe dog door customed installed. The flap would have lasted many years except someone chewed it up. I thought I would have a problem replacing the right size and design door flap... It was perfect. Very pleased.;0
117586;I purchased this as a second tether for the bergan harness (which is great) so that I can easily tether my dog in either the back seat or the back of my station wagon.  The convenience is worth the price.;0
73440;I have these on my subscribe to get these every month. They work great and my baby loves them so much.;0
128615;He chews on everything and we were quickly running out of pork sticks and pressed bones. So i got this and he went to town.;0
21425;what else can i say? my dogs are addicted to it. even if they don't play with the stump they love the squirrels;0
8441;I've been giving this daily to my two dogs, a yellow lab and a mini aussie, following the instructions on the back with the right dosage.The pump is very easy to use, with minimal mess.The substance is a nice orange color with minimal odor, even when you spill some on yourself, it's easy to get it off.My dogs are not bothered by the smell/taste, so that is good (especially since the aussie is super picky).Within a week I noticed their coats looking sleeker and shinier.One thing the instructions don't mention is, please store in the refrigerator upon opening, otherwise it spoils.;0
119431;I live in a 3rd floor walk-up without an elevator, so lugging home cans of cat food can be a total pain. With 2 cats, at about 3-4 cans per cat per day, that can get really heavy, really fast. So it made sense to have a pallet delivered right to my door. My cats really like this new variety with the cheddar morsels, it's a big hit AND someone else carred it up 3 flights, I'm super satisfied.;0
30093;I just got 2 new kittens and gave myself a kitty shower in anticipation of their arrival.This Cat Dancer was one of the presents I gave myself. I included it in my shopping cart only because I lacked a few dollars to get free shipping.The kittens made their transcontinental flight last night and have been wary of me...until I pulled out the Cat Dancer.Now we are best buds.Amazing toy! It's just a wire with some tiny rolled cardboard bits at the end, but it holds the kittens' attention like no other toy. They will play with it until I put it away.Thanks for the fun.;0
130702;"Does it work, doesn't it work, who can actually tell, but I am not taking the chance of aching joints and sore knees by stopping.  The price of these ""little"" and I mean that, little pills is best on Amazon.com.  Sometimes stores have them one sale, ""buy one, get one free"", but that is not frequent and Amazon is consistent.  For almost two years I have been recovering from cancer and started these pills at that time.  I can only tell you that I am almost 60 yrs old and was totally sendentary during my recovery 18 months.  I currently have no joint pains and am starting to feel like my old self.  I cannot guarentee anything, but what's it gonna hurt?  PS, if you have trouble swallowing pills, THIS pill is very small and coated and that is why it probably costs more.  There is a style with a 1"" long pill that is much cheaper, but if you don't like to swallow large pills, this is the easy way to lubricate your joints.";0
83955;My dogs are dachshund black lab mixes and need to keep their weight under control simply due to their body being longer and their legs shorter.  They are ten years old and have lost weight on this product and have plenty of energy.  I will use it as long as they are alive.;0
156015;Despite being a &#34,diet&#34, dog food, my dog loves this food.I have no idea how well it helps a dog lose weight, but it's popular with my dog. To be fair, my dog has not a meal she hasn't scarfed down like she hasn't been fed in weeks... Take her recommendation for what it's worth.;0
94075;My first one has been running 24/7 for 6 months with no problems. Kind of noisy and runs hot, but its pumping!;0
92786;It is a very sturdy collar with a beautiful dark brown color. It also has a good fit for my dog. The only thing I did not like was the logo, which is placed right next to the D metal ring of the collar. The cloth the logo was made out of had a very roughness to it that could possibly irritate the neck of my maltipoo. I removed the logo and it solved the problem. I do not walk him at night, so I am not sure how the reflective part of the collar is just yet. All in all, I am happy with my purchase.;0
102681;I have purchased several of these, because I dont know what I would do without one when we live our dog alone for more than an hour.  She absolutely loves rolling the ball, and getting the treats.  You need to remember to close the tow sections together very tight, or they can come apart, and you could have bite marks on the edges preventing the ball from working at all.  If it does come apart, it is more likely human error than a faulty toy.  I have had this happen to me, and now I check and doulbe check each time I fill it,  so no more dismantling ..;0
27012;This cat scratching post is tall enough for even my tallest male cat.  As for the Gold Box deal price, you can get it cheaper at Drs. Foster and Smith.  Even the regular price is better than Amazon's regular price.  I had one...after my 5 cats wore it out (and it took FOREVER to wear out), I purchased two, one for the livingroom and one for the family room.  They are the best scratch post out there, and I will purchase again when necessary. NOTE:  It has been 6 months...my 5 cats haven't put a dent in these scratching posts yet.  They look brand new.;0
37927;This toy is not even a justt OK quality..  It had almost no stuffing in it and even though my dog is not a chewer, the antlers fell off almost immediately.  I do not recommend this toy.;0
48910;my dog absolutely loves these. They were such a great bargain at amazon.Iwould reccomend these to dog lovers if they want to give their dog a nice treat especially after they have eaten.They reccomend giving them only one a day so this is a great buy. alot cheaper than I can find in the stores.;0
154334;This is a decent quality UV flashlight, I purchased it for use with a leak detection dye and it works much better than the cheep 490nm light that was provided with the dye.Pros-Bright for a UV light-Give you UV light closer to that of a florescent tube blacklight then any UV LED I've tried before. It fully bring out the security features on my ID, something cheaper UV LED lights do not do.-Seems pretty sturdy and well builtCons-It has PeeDar etched into the side, I don't like the name &#34,PeeDar&#34, so this is a downside to me;0
152981;The filter that came with the product is unable to let the water pass through it quickly, this makes it a pain in the butt to add more water. I end up having to unplug the unit, add the water, and then plug it back in (not convenient since the plug is behind a cabinet). Cats seem to enjoy it just as much as they have enjoyed previous models- will probably move away from this style of water bowl on the next one.;0
32571;I have tried 3 other filters and none compare to this brand.  You can double up filter for an amazingly clear aquarium! I found out the hard way and have horrible experiences from other types.;0
48922;Our vet asked us to not give our dogs these because they cannot digest them. Whatever they are made of does not break down once eaten, made my dog sick and when I cleaned his potty I saw entire chunks on the treat. They claim the new formula is digestable, but it wasn't for our dog at least...;0
8811;We purchased this a few months ago along with the coupler for our 2 large dogs and have been very pleased. Granted, this is the first retractable leash we've purchased so we have no basis for comparison but found this leash easy to use and great for walking our dogs. Using the coupler with the leash has been indispensable in our situation given that we have 2 dogs, it's much better than our previous way of walking the dogs, which was through using 2 leashes. We just wish we wouldn't have waited so long to buy this!;0
128673;My staffordshire/german shepherd mix puppy absolutely loves this. We have the Nylabone Wishbone too, and where he likes that bone, he likes this stick much better. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a strong chewer or a teething puppy (I have both rolled up in one puppy).;0
114357;Solid device.  Better than most of the junk out there.  Great range.  I can put this on my pitty and not worry about her getting too far out.  The Esky models are a crap shoot as to whether or not they will work.  The PetSafe just works.  I'd like to get a second for my male pitty.  However once you put a second collar on this remote, it can only be programmed as if there were three collars on it.  Which means the three buttons it has will only beep or zap the dogs they're attached to.  I'd rather it give me the option on the third button to beep, with zap on the other two.Still, I'd recommend it for one dog.;0
80488;I have a female Shih Tzu that had chronic ear infections.  I used to buy prescription medicine for her ears from the vet, which became very expensive.  I decided to give this a try and it worked wonders.  The ear infections have stopped, but I will always have this on hand.  When I went to the vet for a check-up she was amazed that her ears were no longer infected.On a side note....I came down with an inner ear infection on a Friday evening and decided to give this a try myself.  I followed the directions and used this medication for 7 days and my ear infection is gone!  This is a wonderful product! Highly recommend!;0
152560;I have a 2 year old rescue Chihuahua. I brush her teeth every other day with Nylabone toothpaste and Nylabone plaque removing foam, give her Greenies daily, CET enzymatic chews daily, and she has a Nylabone toy she chews on occasionally. I didn't want her to go under anesthesia again (when I got her spayed, they didn't tell me I should have her teeth cleaned too).Despite all this, she still had a bit of plaque remaining. She doesn't get new plaque but it never goes away. So when I read the reviews and online instructions for the tooth scaler, I decided to give it a try. It worked! Within two days, all of the plaque has disappeared! It was easy to scrape off because the metal is strong.My dog is pretty good at staying still during brushings but she didn't like the scaler at first. Lots of treats and praise made it possible to get it done in two batches in two days. Now, her pearly whites are shiny and clean! I'm so happy! This really works!;0
14501;such a simple concept and design and it's amazing how great it works! It does seem funny to write a glowing review for a poop-picker-upper, but it's so good that I wanted to leave my kudos too!;0
8905;I didn't realize how thick this rope toy was going to be when I ordered it.  It is a great toy for a big dog, like a Lab or German Shepherd or bigger.  My dogs are not quite that big and this was a bit heavy for them to carry around or play tug of war with.  I also had to cut off the fringe on the ends because my dogs will eat it.  I am donating this to my granddog, who is a Labrador Retriever and it will be the perfect size for her.  It appears to be pretty sturdy, but with dogs like mine who eat all their toys eventually, who knows??;0
69326;My dog could eat these all day, but I can't afford them even as occasional treats.  And now I'm concerned about the quality of all dog treats.  May have to make my own.  Still...........he sure loves these.;0
115725;This is a toy that my dog has been unable to destroy.  She usually will eat toys and rip out squeakers and stuffing.  This has proved durable thus far and we have had it since Christmas.;0
118645;...Nice little hoodie, but does not run true to Casual Canine Sizing....I prefer the cotton blend of hoodie by this brand.  It fits better, and it is cooler for inside of the house.  Do love Casual Canine for it's quality, I have many clothing items, harness, etc. from CC.;0
29985;My cats absolutely love this toy! They just cannot get enough of it! I keep it folded up in one of my bookcases and they sit at the base of it and cry at me begging for me to get the toy down so they can play. It's great for wearing down kittens so they'll go to sleep at night. I turn on a one hour show and watch tv while I bounce it all over the living room while they chase it. When my program is done=I have worn out kitties! Best toy ever!!!;0
148330;Its great it doesn't have all of the additives and animal byproducts. Its definitely quality food! I highly recommend this!;0
58725;I bought this toy for my African Grey about a year ago. She loves it. I leave it in her cage 24/7. Although I rotate old toys and add new ones I never mess with this one.It's her favorite. She uses it every day constantly. In all the rough play she has managed to crack the mirror but it still has all it's buttons. I can't remember where I bought the toy I think Amazon. I am so impressed how it has held up so well. Don't be surprised when you get the large mine was red. I am buying two more because I heard a rumor they were going to stop making them and  I am adopting another parrot.  I truly hope they keep these available. I will be so sad if I can't get more when needed. If you have smaller birds such as a cockatiel or similar in size don't get the large. Very happy with this toy!;0
135572;I thought I would try this because the price was right and within 30 minutes fleas were jumping off of my dogs.;0
140546;Ingredient: Freeze dried turkey breast. Period. Not even a smidgeon of any other ingredients.We put pieces of these freeze dried turkey breast pieces on the dried food of our girls' dinner. They go for their meal ravenously, eating the turkey first, their momentum carrying them to the dried food with almost as much gusto.  Mrs. Spudman occasionally cooks up a chicken breast for the dogs, but buying a bag of the freeze dried turkey is much more convenient and the turkey lasts longer than our cooked chicken. A little pricey, but for us it's worth it.;0
1202;Doesn't work well.;0
120656;My dog loves these treats and I give her the mini's even though she is a big dog as they are more of a treat for her.;0
56451;My 11lb Shih-pooh fits inside nicely.  In fact she has room to spare, however, she does not really care for it to much.  She has been in a soft sided, canvas type crate but where we work it got very dusty and dirty, so we needed to switch to something a bit easier to clean.  She is still getting used to it and I think she'll love it (eventually)!;0
34335;I like these because they break in half and get smaller. Great for IQ toys and they are soft and chewy. My little doggies love these.;0
6833;These are fun for the kittens and cats that we foster. I also like that I can wash them easily and that I can use them over and over. The price is also right.;0
99903;We use these for our incontinent dog every day. These fit her well, they are easy to put on, the velcro works very well.  She slides out of them often, I wish they stayed on but I think this has more to do with the way our dog drags on the ground ( hind limb paralysis) than  quality of the product.;0
39394;This is a great little toothbrush for my 15 lb maltipoo. He doesn't really mind me brushing his teeth with this toothbrush, Thank God! Great product for a small dog.;0
7658;It is tall and sturdy but even my six month old 2.5 pound chihuahua puppy can move it all over if she really wants to be someplace else in the room when I am not there.  The construction is really good but will only work with a small dog that doesn't mind a crate.  I have used it with washable puppy pads at one end and her bed and food at the other and as long as she doesn't mind being there she is totally and securely confined.  She has never climbed out but can push the crate around as she is a really determined chihuahua.  The crate itself is well built but easily moved.  The gate at first was a little difficult to open and latch back but after a few tries it was no big deal so not really an issue.  I had hoped to have a crate that didn't move and I thought this would be the one but I didn't realize this tiny bit of determination could move it so I guess this is a misjudgment on my part.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a very well built crate and didn't mind if it could be moved but with a puppy pad in there the pad just gets squashed up and hence not much help in housebreaking.  However, she is mostly housebroken but didn't like hopping over the edge of the door to get to her pad so I just turned the pen upside down so the top is flush with the floor and the lip is just an overhead thing and the door still opens and closes perfectly.  She is tiny so that is not an issue with her being too tall and not wanting to duck to get to her pad.  I just leave the door open and she goes in and out to use the pad.  I have since made the pen smaller and taken her bed out and the pen sits well on a large dog washable puppy pad.  She loves that she can go right in and out and her bed is across the room.  Recently I tried taking the pen off the pad and she still uses just the pad but goes around the pad where the pen used to be before she does her business.  So now I am going to use the pen just for travel and outside activities where I need her more confined.;0
45666;My guinea pig is afraid of this right now. Once she gets used to it, I think she will use it. Will be a great way to keep her cage cleaner and neater.;0
75492;I got this for my Aquaclear 30. I needed something to pick up the finer debris that came from the substrate. This fits pretty well in the aquaclear. I put it on the top.;0
52002;I really like the idea of elevating the water bowl in the kennels of my three dogs. My rambunctious and independent Yorkie has a fun time making huge messes for me to clean up after he takes a bath in his water bowl. I bought these to try out and for the most part, I really like them. They are easy to attach to the door of the kennel and hold a decent amount of water. My biggest issue is how difficult it is to remove the bowl. I imagine this is to keep a dog from yanking it off, but I often can't get it off without making a mess.  They do snap back into place relatively easy - it is getting them off that is difficult. Overall, I am really happy with the purchase and have three of them.;0
138197;These develop quite a bit of head loss across them (very resistive) and have ends that are far too big for most air lines (not barbed, just big).  You can get them to fit better if you heat up the line in a cup of boiling water and then slip on...other than that, I'm not super impressed.;0
142332;We normally used a regular measuring spoon for measuring Angel Eyes for our white dog but since using the scoop as the measure his eyes are completely cleared, so we apparently were not measuring correctly with the regular measuring spoon.;0
89174;At first I was skeptical because my dogs are really obsessive about the orange chuckit balls and never thought we would find a better ball, but after using these balls I have to say I'm very pleased. One of our labs, Sheba, has suffered from seizures and has become partially blind. Sometimes it's difficult for her to find a ball when we throw it a long ways. (We have a fenced in acre which is essentially our dog park.) These balls really do help her to track it because they whistle when flying in the air. It's not very loud to me, but my dogs can defiantly follow the sound. These balls are harder and lighter than the orange balls and bounce better, too.When throwing the orange balls, Sheba would bring back only about 50% of the time and our other lab would go find the ball for her and bring it back. But with these she brought the ball back 100% of the time!So I have to give a big kudos to Chuckit for making ball time more fun for Sheba and thanks from our family!;0

86565;I bought this as a Christmas present for my 6 year old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. She loves her toys, and this is the largest toy she owns now. She loves squeakers and having so many on one toy just made her SO HAPPY! She went nuts over this great toy, it's her new favorite toy. It's really quality made and she is pretty rough on stuff. She has tried to rip it's face off and it's just as good as new. Great product.;0
86687;One of my dogs usually gets bored of new toys after a few minutes. I was pleasantly surprised that he likes this toy! I've had it a week and it's kept his interested every day still. I think it's because of the unique squeaker design. It's not your typical speaker. It's like a rubber drone and it produces different tones of squeaks- and none of them are your typical the typical high pitch squeaks.;0
79516;My cat ingests all the hair that she licks off of herself as well as any stray hairs of mine that happen upon one of her toys. I worry that down the line she will have issues and wanted to give her a digestive aid to prevent blockages inside her.I'm so glad that this gel is all natural. Although my vet says a LITTLE petrolatum isn't harmful to a cat, but to give a cat 1/2 tsp of it every day might be bad. It even smells good - not fishy, but like maple syrup.What I'm most glad for is that now I can take her off of Science Diet hairball formula. Why do vets recommend kibble that contains corn meal and corn products in general??I'm going to start her on a grain-free kibble and keep administering this hairball remedy.;0
24691;My dog's breeder had recommended &#34,Purina Veterinary Diets Fortiflora Canine, 30 Sachets Per Box&#34,, and she sent me home with a weeks supply to add to my puppy's food.  I ordered a box from Amazon.  When I needed more I was looking for a comparable product that was less expensive and found this.  I just add about a 1/2 teas with her morning dog food...........  I've had it 2? months now and I would expect I have enough for another 3 months from this one jar.  Certainly more economical.  The only differences besides not having doses individually packaged, is that the Purina brand has a additive that kind of makes a light brown &#34,gravy&#34,, and of course..........the price!  I will buy this product again.;0
101128;"In the years that I've had my cats, the Friskies Prime Filets are the ones that they seem to love the most. between the one being reviewed here ""Meaty selections"" to seafood selection they can't get enough. No other will do it seems. I like the 24 can box since it lasts longer and with Amazon Prime is cheaper. Subscribe and its even cheaper and i don't have to worry about finding a place when there isn't any cat food and the cat gives you a stare of ""Where's my food""Bottom line, They seems to like it very much. I'm sure if they can rate it it would be 5 meows out of 5.";0

136100;I ordered this because it was a case of 6 which is supposed to mean you get 6 bags. I only received 1 bag. If you got the 6 bags for the price then that would be a great deal. But since you only get 1 bag it is a complete RIP OFF. You can get the same thing anywhere else for MUCH less. I love this bedding, NOT this seller. This is the first time amazon has made me mad, but they made me mad in a BIG way. I would recommend this product if you get it from some where else. It makes a great nesting material for a hamster cage. I know people who use it for the whole cage and it looks great like that.;0
32765;I bought this cool bed to replace an old one of a different brand. But, this item did not reach my expectations. I read & followed the instructions. But, after only a few months, it smelled really bad and had mold growing on it. So, I ended up having to throw it away. I would not ever buy this brand again, nor recommend it!;0
155087;I have two 8 pound Havanese who eat their evening meal in food puzzles.  I try to rotate the puzzles and am always on the lookout for new ones, as they get very adept at the old ones.  Although this is made to slow down a dog's eating speed, it was a great mind puzzle for my little guys.  They have to figure out where to push the food so that they can reach it.  It takes a long time for a meal but they are not frustrated (they let you know!), just concentrating and relaxed.  I imagine this would be great for a large dog also.  Sturdy, dishwasher safe, and a great price.;0
126706;This review is for a sample packet of Stella & Chewy's Yummy Lickin' Salmon & Chicken Dinner. This food is touted as being made with raw meats which are pasteurized via hydrostatic high pressure then freeze-dried. The label also says: no grain, added hormones or antibiotics, artificial preservatives, sugar, salt, or colorings. The company suggests rehydrating the food with water before serving (cats are notorious for not drinking adequately).I like the ingredient profile (no grains/carbohydrates) and that the food is pasteurized. I figured my cats would be excited about it. I first prepared some nuggets as directed, in water. My cats wouldn't touch it. Another day, I offered them the nuggets plain. One ate them after examining them a bit (the other just sniffed them and walked away), and then he left pieces...which he later returned to and ate most of them, leaving some crumbs. --I will keep this food in mind, and perhaps, as others have suggested, try it as a food topper.Flavors that I may try later with my cats include: Duck Duck Goose, Chick, Chick, Chicken, and Tummy Ticklin' Turkey. I like that Stella & Chewy's offers several fowl offerings sans fish (fish is a common allergen in cats).The food is noted as being prepared in a Wisconsin manufacturing facility with poultry sourced from USDA-inspected facilities and fish sourced from FDA-regulated facilities. (That doesn't necessarily mean the facilities are in the U.S.A.) The sample packet, brochure, nor company web site list the actual source of the meat. I will contact the company and update this review when I learn more.This food contains bone meal. For many cats, bone meal is good in food. However, bone meal may be a concern if a cat has chronic kidney disease.Overall, I think Stella & Chewy's looks like a good option.Ingredients particular to this flavor include: whole ground salmon, chicken (ground with bone), chicken liver, chicken gizzard, parsley (a source of vitamin K).Ingredients in all the Stella & Chewy's freeze-dried cat food include: pumpkin seed, potassium chloride, sodium phosphate monobasic, choline chloride, dried Pediococcus Acidillactici fermentation product, dried Lactobacillus Acidophilus fermentation product, dried Bifidobacterium Longum fermentation product, dried Enterococcus Faecium fermentation product, taurine, tocopherols (preservative), zinc proteinate, zinc sulfate, iron sulfate, iron proteinate, vitamin E supplement, niacin, copper sulfate, copper proteinate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, manganese proteinate, thiamine mononitrate, pyridoxine hydrochloride, vitamin D3 supplement, calcium iodate, vitamin B12 supplement.;0
74592;"I originally became a fan of pouch-based cat food with the Nutro line of pouches. However, Nutro was especially hit by the nasty recall episode from a few years back where a number of pet food manufacturers had contamination issues, and they eventually pulled their pouches. I tried a bunch of canned foods afterwards, but my cats never warmed to any of them like they did the pouches.Wellness came out with their ""healthy indulgence"" line of pouch foods not too long ago, and interestingly the packaging is pretty much identical to the Nutro products, down to the notches to facilitate tearing. I can only imagine that they are using the same manufacturing facilities as Nutro did, but hopefully with a superior product. Everything I've read about Wellness suggests that they make high-quality pet foods. My cats seem to love these as much as they did their old pouch foods. They have now been eating pouch foods almost daily for at least 6-7 years, so I don't have any major concerns about long-term health issues.Overall, these pouches are great. Each single pouch is one serving for one cat, so the costs do add up fast if you have multiple cats and serve this twice a day. I give dry food in the morning and the pouches at night to help conserve costs, but they always finish the Wellness pouches within a half hour, whereas the dry food often sits around unfinished all day. Another plus is that no spoons or forks need to be involved, since you just tear each pouch and shake the contents into the bowl. No mess or debates with spouses about putting cat food forks into the dishwasher with the rest of the dishes!";0
26141;These treats are a nice size, I believe they are 11 calories each, and my three dogs think they are awesome.I want to give my dogs healthy treats, not junk food, so these cookies are perfect. They are too big for training (as you would want something tiny and fast for the dog to eat, not sit there and crunch for a bit) but if you want something as a nice little reward for being your best doggy friend, these are great. The lower fat means they have less calories so you don't have to worry about your puppy getting fat from these.;0
112507;This was just the right size for my 20lb bags of cat food (I kept debating between this and the larger size - glad I picked this one!).  The container looks good and seems very durable - definitely better quality than the really cheap plastic containers you see.I did take the other reviewers suggestions and am storing the cat food in the bag inside the container just to help keep it cleaner.I am a little weary of it being a foam vs. a rubber seal, but hoping that won't cause problems in the future.Overall, for the price this is a great container...the wheels go on easily and seem to work well on carpet.;0
112799;I basicly bought this tool because I got such a good deal on Amazon and it was so expensive in the stores.  After trying it out, I think it does a superb job at removing the undercoat on my shepherd.  Used it on my Rottie and it works well also.;0
50364;I have had multiple fountains/watering set ups for my 2 cats.  This fountain is by far the best.  I had one of these for a few years, and after a rough and tumble when the water reservoir was dropped which resulted in a crack down the back, and the motor for the water burned out and was overflowing the fountain, I decided to get another.  If the water reservoir had not cracked, I would have just looked into replacing the motor.But I just bought this fountain again, and I love it.  It also has the largest water capacity on the market for fountains of this size--and I travel a lot so its good to know that it can keep my cats watered for more than a day or two (it lasts about two weeks on a fill for my cats).I also bought the Drinkwell Pet Fountain Mat for the Pet Fountain, and I'm really glad I did.  Last time I didn't have one and my cats would spill the water over pretty often since they like to play in it.  This time, it'll keep it stationary, and catch at least some of the mess.It also comes with the attachment to mount cat grass on it.  Pretty cool, I'm still debating whether I want to try that or not.;0
83097;My yorkie loves these,and she's very picky when it comes to treats. I give her one to two a day and definitely notice her breath is not as bad as when she's not eating them. She also has a very sensitive stomach and these don't seem to bother her.;0
133526;I bought this harness so our recently-adopted and super energetic pitbull mix could go running with my wife. Her previous harness (one of those ubiquitous, cheap nylon ones) was causing some rubbing and irritation when she would run. We measured her according to the guidelines, and went with the Medium/Large size - it fit perfectly. With the ComfortFlex, there was no rubbing or redness or irritation, even after longer physical activities. The ComfortFlex works great for active pursuits like running, and it is super-easy to put on and take off.[EDITED 7/31/2013] The original harness broke after about 5 weeks of use. After I posted the initial review, I was contacted by the manufacturer. We sent the broken harness back in to be checked, and it turns out we had received one with a small manufacturing defect. They sent us a replacement, and it's been working like a charm! Our dog was really excited when we took it out of the box, and insisted that we put it on her and try it out right away.;0
71116;This is the best Grain Free dog food that I could find that wasn't at such a ridiculous price.  Not saying that this dog food is cheap, but its the best deal when your looking for an upscale dog food.Also, for the record my dogs don't have food allergies or anything, but I do believe that they should be on the grain free diet because its healthier for them.  Plus, they don't need as much food as some of the cheap dog foods that have a bunch of fillers, so the cost to eating rate ratio decreases a little there.  Also, eating less food equals less poop....which is always a good thing! haha;0
142205;My cat likes to sleep under my bed because she likes to have something over her. I live in a 550 sq ft apartment and all the play pens I found were too big. This is the perfect size and easy to ensemble. Just throw a couple of blankets in there, or if your pet is spoiled like mine, a memory foam bed.. anyway, this is perfect if you are looking for something small for a cat or a small dog. My parents have the large one for their chihuahua. I'm not quite sure why but she likes to too. For the price, you can't beat it!;0
12150;This is a nice feeder, but it did not work well for our lab.  It could have easily been doubled in size and worked perfectly, but the height that it is now, its just not conducive for a larger dog that may suffer from eating problems and needs to  stand more erect when eating.  It would be perfect for a medium or small dog.;0
69800;One of the very few hard biscuit treat my picky dog will eat. These are very small which is a good size for my dog. I also give her soft treats so Once in a while she's disappointed when she sees it's a hard treat and will refuse it but toss it on the floor and she'll pick it up and eat it so it must taste good.;0
60740;This is a great value for quality food. I have three cats who each get a tablespoon or so of wet food a day and the larger size can option makes that easy. I bought some plastic lids and keep partially used cans in the fridge. My cats can be picky, but find this very palatable, and the quality of the food makes me happy.;0

123565;We have 2 labs. They love to play together and race for their toys. From the first throw, they loved the ball. It fits perfectly in one's mouth, so the other chases the one with the ball and can't steal it. We haven't plalyed with it very long, so I don't know how long it lasts, but I'm excited to use it more as the dogs LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it.;0
7553;My Betta Sammy and his community tankmates love these. Yummy for their tummies. I just wish that they floated longer and didn't sink so quickly. These are the perfect size for small fish, but I can't see why larger fish won't enjoy them.;0
73677;5 Stars for the product minus two for the price mess up from the shipper...ultimately corrected...but I will now purchase the cans at the store....my dogs gobbled this down, mixed with their kibble---so I am very happy with the product;0
119498;I have to agree with the other reviews...the smell of this litter, while smelling very pleasant and fresh, is very overpowering. I had to stop using it because that's all I could smell in my house...even our clothes smelled of it. Very good CLUMPING BUT extremely dusty....no way is it almost 100% dust free.;0
69373;When we got a new puppy we really didn't want to go the puppy pad training way, but he was sick the first week and we had no other choice but to let him use the pads.  I tried 3 brands and the Out! brand seems to be the best.  I hate the fact that the puppy is associating white squares on the floor with acceptable places to relieve himself, because I have some awesome white throw rugs in my bedroom (which is off-limits, but he got in there once, and it wasn't good.)Hopefully this stage won't last long but these pads come in handy.  He only uses a pad once and then he's done - wants a clean one.  It's basically a waste of money.  A tip most everyone knows is to clean the floor real well under the pad after he's soiled it, and it has been removed, so he doesn't smell his odor on the spot anymore.I also recommend a puppy training manual.  We are using one from Cesar Milan, the dog whisperer, and it's helping a lot.;0
50342;"This works great.  I had a laugh watching my cat ""investigate"" this when I first set it up and put it where her old water bowl was.  For about a hour, she was cautious and would walk up to the water bowl and swat at the waterfall.  It was hilarious.  We've had this for about a month now, and so far so good.  She seems to drink out of it often and she has fresh water at all times, which makes me feel like a better mother.  I can work really long hours sometimes, so some days, I literally just come home to sleep before heading back to work in the morning.  So, having one less thing to do in the mornings (changing her water) is great.  I clean and change her water on the weekend and it's been working great.My own (tiny) complaint about this item is that because of the water dripping out, there's always a trickling sound coming from that area, and since her food area is close to my kitchen, I always think I left the faucet on, haha.  But this isn't a design defect or anything.  Since it's dripping out water, it's naturally going to make some noise.  I love this water fountain, so this is not a real issue, but thought it was worth mentioning.";0

43545;We have a kitty cat who adopted US about four years ago.Despite trips to the vet, all her shots, etc etc, she had a problemwith watery eyes. The vet suggested that it might be allergies, andgave us a suggestion for an allergy tablet. Not a bad idea, IF we couldget it down her! While no cat likes pills, this one makes it her goal tobe sure there is endless drama if you try to give her one, includinggrowling, barking at us (yes barking!), hissing and foaming at the mouth.She is also masterful at making herself throw a pill back up if we managedto get one down her!We'd keep her weepy eye cleaned, of course, but she would also sneeze from timeto time, usually on us, or in the water dish - ew!  After reading so many otherpositive reviews, I decided to give this product a try. By the way, it was neversuggested by our vet, whom I suspect of being very pro-dog, and not fond of cats!Anyway, within days of putting the small amount in her food (I mixed it in - haven'ttried just sprinkling it on top yet), her eye has become much better, and not onesneeze to be heard!The only change has been the addition of this Viralys to her meals, so the credithas to go to this!  It is even very cold here, when she normally gets small sniffly colds,and nothing at all!  Yay!I don't know if this needs to be given daily or not, so once we were cleared up, I amgiving it to her a couple times a week, unless it seems like we need to go back to daily.It is too bad there are not other scents/flavors. This has a definite fishy odor, whichthey don't seem to mind. I have no idea how it tastes and don't plan to find out, but bothour cats prefer poultry to fish flavored foods, so wish they offered a chicken Viralys!Maybe in the future...Meanwhile, if your cat has endless sniffles, a weepy or damp eye, I highly recommend this one!;0
138470;We live in northern NJ and every year at this time is bow-hunting season for deer.  I go hiking frequently with my two dogs off leash in the woods where hunters may be, so i purchased these vests.  Both of my dogs are about the same size and weigh about 45lbs each and the medium fit perfectly.  There are two adjustable velcro straps, one around the neck and one around the chest.  I tried them out today and they fit fine.  I put their harnesses on top of the vests, no problem.  Let me tell you, you can see these from over 100 yards very clearly as they run through the woods.  (posted some pics of the vests on my dogs)Not sure yet how they will hold up, but for the price and free Prime shipping, it's a real winner!;0
121901;This collar does work.  It came in black instead of blue.  Also watch out because you have to remove other tags if the dog shakes its head the chimes of the ID tags sets it off.  The beep it makes can be heard with human ears and the vibration is low.  I found the dog repeller to be more useful for controlling barking than this because atleast with the dog repeller i can hit the button for a second to correct the barking instead of the collar which goes off for 5 seconds;0

My main issue is that there is a ""do not place below this line"" and it is about 1"" below the ""do not allow water below this line"".  My tank evaporates 2 inches in a week... so if I didn't fully submerge it, it would overheat due to lack of water.  I've hard it submerged now for a couple of months with no problem, however, it is concerning that there is a max water level on a submergable heater.  It works great and is working fully submerged, but I gave it a 4 because I suspect this might void the warranty.";0
47595;With 4 dogs in the house, I love the convenience of having several boxes on hand. These are some of the most healthiest treats on the market.

118450;I've had this setup running 24/7 for over a year now and it&#8217,s been working very well! It does everything it is supposed to and works perfectly for my freshwater tank. The UV light is fantastic when I use it and can clear my water up overnight.Some issue it does have however are the seal on the top and putting it back together after cleaning. Once you finish cleaning and want to put everything back together, it's a guess and check game on whether or not you put the baskets in the correct position. I recommend making some marks on the canister and lid to help remind you how to place the baskets in the canister. As for the red seal around the top piece, you MUST push it all the way back into place around the entire top before closing the canister or else it will leak!Once I figured all that out I had a great canister filter for my 120g freshwater planted tank!;0
46603;The bed has held up to my puppy for a few weeks now....she bites it, drags it and also sleeps in it. She is only 11 lbs, so maybe that is why it seems to be durable.

139808;Not for a Yorkie.  This is a homemade outfit.  Not to keep any dog secure.  It is in its packaging, and not even worthy of giving to a shelter.  What should I do with it?  Cute..

45464;Purina Pro Plan Beef, Carrots & Rice Entr&eacute,e in Gravy opens with a fragrant spicy beef bouquet with notes of ripe carrots and fluffy brown rice. On the palate, the texture is full bodied, viscous and balanced. The flavor profile is a hearty beef blend with notes of fish that lilts gently across the tongue.  The meaty tidbits are packed in a generous amount of delicious lip smacking gravy. The taste lingers for quite some time (i.e. I can re-taste it when I burp - I like that in a food). Whether your taste buds prefer beef bourguignon or fresh mouse, this offering will be perfect for you.  I suggest you pair it with bowl of tap water and perhaps a mouthful of crunchy kibble.Enjoy - Steve The Cat,,,^. .^,,, ~;0
102001;We bought this for our dog when she was just under a year old and still had a high urge to chew. The one flaw is that she was able to bite a small hole in the toy. Thankfully, she hasn't managed to make it larger, or make any additional holes, however please note you shouldn't leave your dog unsupervised with this toy to chew on. That being said for tossing and playing fetch it's a great choice. I purchased this especially for playing in the house on rainy days because it's light and doesn't break anything if it hits furniture, bookcases, etc. All in all I recommend this for people with dogs who have energy to play. P.S. we have a 73lb. shepherd mix and it works just fine with her!;0

99562;I bought this filter from Petsmart and I thought it was great when I first got it up and running.  I really like the fact it's slim and takes up less room and also has an adjustable flow on it.  The first week I had to keep looking at the water to see if it was running since it was so quiet.  Now two weeks later it makes a constant hum.  I've tried everything, taking the lid off, making sure it wasn't touching the hood or any cords, adjusting the angle, and nothing has worked.  It's driving me crazy!!  Not sure what I'm going to do about it but I do know I can only take the hum for so long before I yank it out.  What seemed perfect, isn't.;0

132504;Great leash for long walks. My dogs still have freedom to run and play together while on their leashes. Worth the money!!!;0
84785;its not the most luxurious brush but my cat has a really long coat that is not fluffy (kind of like rabbit fur), so I need a brush appropriate for that, but that doesn't have too deep of bristles.  This works out quite nicely.  It's quite small and shallow, I can brush her without causing her too much annoyance.  It's kinda cheap but it's what I was after.edit: you know what I have to bump this up a star.  Its really the only brush my cat will tolerate.  It catches plenty of hair.  It is kind of cheap like I said and I will probably need to replace it a few times a year since I brush her every day and the pins will bend easily...but I can't imagine making it any more solid and keeping it light and tiny...so I can't fault them for it.  Its really perfect for my tiny kitty with long fine hair.;0

1326;When our dog plays with this thing she throws it in the air and when it lands it sounds like she just threw a brick.  Minus the loud nature of this toy it is great, our dog is a powerful chewer and she can put bite marks into it but that's about all.  We have had this toy for about 5 months and it is still intact but with hundreds of bite marks in it.  I would strongly recommend NOT stepping on this.  Overall this is a durable toy that our dog loves.;0
144263;I had polio as an infant so bending and stooping are harder for me now that I'm approaching 60 y/o (gosh that looks dreadful in writing).  This design is particularly helpful in keeping the scoop off of the floor and in a convenient location.  I purchased it to fit onto the side of the large Nature's Miracle corner box with high sides, which is also a dream.  Good quality plastic, very pleased with my purchase;0

127069;I loved the IDEA of this collar.  My Boston Terrier (20lbs) and I take a lot of off-leash walks on the city trails, and it's nice to have the option of a lease ready at-hand.  The thing I was most excited about with this product was the idea that I don't have to let his existing leather leash trail on the dusty, muddy trail while we're walking.  I still think this could be GREAT for larger dogs, and could do exactly these things.  However, the EXECUTION leaves some room for improvement.It's way too big and bulky for little dogs, and unfortunately, inappropriate for flat-faced (brachycephalic) dogs like Bostons, Pugs, and Bulldogs.  As the photo I posted shows, this is an incredibly large thing to be hanging off of a small dog's collar.  My dog keeps shaking his head and trying to pull the collar off when we leave the house.  I think this leash thingy would be very nice and appropriately sized on a larger dog's collar, but it's too much for a 20lb dog, I think.It also doesn't have the option to lock the leash in a certain position, which would be really nice.  It's so thin that it really pinches my hands if I try to hold it at a certain length (important if you are training the dog to walk by you at all times when on-leash).  A locking mechanism would be nice.  Addition length would also be really nice, since this seems too short to let the dog sniff more than a foot away from me.Lastly, I think this would be far better as something I could ADD to the dog's existing harness.  Flat-faced dogs should often avoid collars around the neck, since they are more prone to choking, reverse sneezing, and other neck/breathing-related injuries.  In fact, I inspected the collar and I think I'm going to slim it down to its smallest collar size and then clip it onto the back of his SENSE-ation dog harness (extra small).  Kind of bulky, but might be more useful for me.  If the leash holder were smaller, the leash a little longer, and it possibly included a locking mechanism, I think it'd be appropriate for a lot of smaller dog owners.;0
88364;my shih tzu (notably finiky) eats/gnaws on these until they are nubs!  they smell good, too!  best chew I've ever purchased! thanks!;0
139646;Picked up one of these for my 3 month old Pembroke Welsh Corgi puppy.  For the price, it can't be beat.  It's about as simple as they come.  The base unscrews to pop in a replacement roll.  It includes a clip and velcro to attach it to a standard leash.  The included bags have a light pleasant scent.  I have had no problem with tears or getting the bags to open.  I intend to refill it moving forward with the unscented compostable bags from the same company.  The rolls appear to be the same size so I don't anticipate any problems making the switch.  I would have preferred the old style dispenser that has the caribiner personally, but it's a minor detail in the grand scheme of things.  We find we have to be careful where we clip it on the leash as she is quick to mistake it for a chew toy when she notices it.;0
111571;I have two of these for my cat and I purchased one for a neighbors little dog.  We live in Florida and our winters do get cold for this area and our pets aren't really used to cooler weather.  My cat adores her beds, sleeps in them all the time.  My neighbor was concerned her pet wouldn't use it.  Well guess what, she can't get the dog out of it.  Her cat fights with the dog to use it.  The animals love them.  Their little tummies are so warm.  Plenty of spread out room for a small animal.  Be aware if you have an animal that sheds (dog or cat) the bed does attract and hold their fur so you have to continually clean fur out of it but it is EASY to do.  Also cat litter that gets caught in paws also winds up in the bed but again, just shake out the bed once in a while.  Your pet will love you for purchasing this bed for them.;0
42897;These little bones have two knots (one at each end) and will fit in the palm of your hand.  That said, they are loved by our dogs up to about 30 lbs.  After that, we switch to the Small Dingos instead of Mini.  The Big Dogs gets the larges!  Can't say enough good things about this company and about how many years we've been buying them.  Not a single dog ever turned one down.  Love in a bag!;0
151386;My dog loves getting treats out of toys, but this one just didn't hold up to Kong's regular reputation. He had the ends of it (the 4 circles on the end of the bone) chewed completely off in less than a day. Definitely don't leave your dog alone with the toy if he's a strong chewer. He'll get the pieces off and could swallow them.;0
101396;"At it's current selling price, this is one relatively expensive water dish.  Is it worth it?  When I chose it, I hoped so. One of my two cats was becoming picky about drinking water and I hoped the bubbling design would peak his curiousity.  At first both cats were turned off to the motor noise but eventually the female started to use the dish, but preferred a standard water dish. I wondered why both cats would try to drink but got turned off to using the dish, I assumed it was the motor noise so I waited a few months to see what would happen (and held off writing this review).After careful observation I see now what's happening.  It's not the motor noise, it's the design of the bowl itself.  I wonder how a company can make a water dish without understanding one of the first basics of cats ... they don't want to stick their faces into places that are smaller than their whisker span.  Duh.  The artsy design of this dish makes the actual drinking area extremely tiny and odd teardrop shaped, with a high wall (the water slide) imposingly placed adjacent to the bowl.  The cats just can't get their faces close to the water without their whiskers being squished and an unfriendly surface blocking their view (cats also need to be in control for protection against the unknown, the high wall prevents that).Yesterday after cleaning the bowl I had the idea of setting the motor to the lowest speed and leaving the fancy curvy top off.  Success!  It is much more cat friendly now and still has the bubbling effect.  But that leaves me with a very expensive plain water dish.As others have noted, I suspect this is not really stainless steel but rather chrome plated metal. Even with soft, filtered water the surface stains and scales something terrible and is not easy to clean.  I don't know why, but as others have noted it also gets slimy very fast (faster than a standard water dish), I suspect it's because the water is trapped under the metal cover and can't ""breathe"".  I finally ran it through the dishwasher and had to spend a half hour scrubbing it by hand after that.Looking back at the other bubbling water dishes, most have a large easy to access water surface (like the same company's Big Max).  I should have seen the issue as soon as I looked at the photos, there is no logic at all for having such a tiny teardrop shaped water surface ... it's purely design over function and it makes this a poor choice for a feline water dish.[ADDENDUM] After I wrote this review I decided to remove the motorized pump entirely.  Now without the odd top cover and the whirring sound of a motor my cats love this dish. The picky one drinks from it regularly throughout the day. And the water doesn't get slimy. I could have (and should have) just bought a stainless steel dog dish for a fraction of the price. I'm leaving it at two stars which means ""I don't like it"" rather than one star for ""I hate it"".";0
100552;"I ordered this product to have around the house ""just in case,"" and three days later my cat got an upset stomach and made a mess around the litterbox, up the stairs to the front door landing, and then came up another flight of stairs and scooted around for a bit (which is how I realized that we had a problem in the first place).Well, I made a batch of Fizzion (spray bottle, warm water, one tablet) and cleaned everything and the smell is SO clean, as are the floors, the walls and the little bit of carpeting that he also managed to mess up...and of course there's a ton of product left over because one tablet makes 23 oz. of cleaner.I never found Nature's Miracle to work that well. I used to use OdoBan because the smell is so pleasant. But THIS stuff, this stuff smells clean without being harsh. Costs so much less per bottle, there's no comparison. I'm a convert!";0
117361;All I have to say is this litter catcher is a genuis idea!  Very easy to assemble the bag in the container and very easy use.  For multiple cat owners though you may want to consider purchasing more than one.  I have one cat and it does fine for her.It would be nice to be able to purchase a larger size one, especially if you have more than one cat.  I love how the scoop has it's own holder and you just lift the lid, place the litter in the top and pull the lever...all done!  Litter is stored in the bottom part of the container in the bag and there is no smell or mess.  WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL!;0
93000;We bought the 3/4 inch leash for our 30 lb french bulldog and it's perfect. It's long enough to coil it if you need to reel in slack and long enough to let out without too much freedom. It's thin, but very sturdy and made of a nice smooth material with reflective stitching on one side. We're very pleased with this purchase.;0
85952;My dogs love Beneful.  I have tried Science Diet and I had to put cheese on it for them to even touch it.  I have tried Kibbles N Bits, and yes, they love that too, but Beneful is somewhat healthier.  If you compare the two brands, Beneful has 25% protein compared to Kibbles 19%.  Beneful also uses mostly natural ingredients, for example- sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup.  While it is not the healthiest or recommended by vets, it is the best of the cheap options available.  Also noteworthy, my parents switched their dogs to the Healthy Weight Beneful and they both lost about 10 lbs over the past year.;0
77410;We have three big dogs ranging from about 55 pounds to just over 100 pounds. Needless to say they can eat a lot.They seemed to like this food and we didn't have any problem getting them to eat it. We mixed it with their regular limited ingredient food so that it would seem like a treat to them. If you read the packaging however you will notice this is not a real high quality dog food. Our male dog (about 95 pounds) has skin issues and some of the ingredients in this would send him off to the vet quickly if this were his only food. So be warned if your dog has any kind of food allergy or skin issues this may be one to stay away from.The price is OK. It may seem high but when you are used to the price of limited ingredient foods this is much lower. You do get what you pay for some times though and this is not a food I can fully endorse. Do not be taken in by the name on the label.With that said I can say the Rachel Ray wet food is much better than most of what is out there and at last check did not contain meat by-products. Again, don't be swayed by the name and pretty face, instead read the ingredients and see if one of her products is right for your dog.Do the dogs like it?--A minusIngredients--DOverall Score--C or 3 stars;0

82671;I like these chews over rawhides. They're a little harder to find but I feel a little better handing him this than rawhides. They're about as thick as other chews so it ends up being a good alternative. They get chewed up a lot faster than rawhides, though--my dog is finished in like 3 minutes.;0
68533;I have a bunny named Jose. He had the rabbit sickness known as the snuffles. I read a thread online and a person who raises rabbits suggested using this product instead of taking the rabbit to the vet. So I bought this product.I used the entire bottle on my rabbit and he was still sneezing, coughing, and had runny eyes. So I finally took him to the vet and they said that they see a lot of their patients attempt to use products like this but they DO NOT WORK. Sometimes it can relieve symptoms but it will not get rid of the bacteria or illness. I basically wasted $30 on this product. I should have taken my money and used it at the vet. My rabbit was on antibiotics that they gave me for two weeks, and I notice that he is significantly better already. If you really care about your pet just take them to the vet to someone who knows the issue. If you use this product you will end up wasting money and needing to take your pet to the vet anyway.;0
6033;I order this from Amazon unless I find it for buy one get one free at a local store.  We use these for our 6 cages of gerbils... my wife breeds them.  It works good for all adults, but juveniles can get red nose from it.  For newborns and juvies, we use Kaytee Clean and Cozy bedding.  That being said, any cages with adults we use Carefresh Natural exclusively.;0
119678;Bought this off the same seller on Ebay for cheaper and larger quantity. Not the actual Fluval Edge sponge and is a bit tighter I believe and differs a little, but still great. Fits just fine and works well for other small filters with smaller intakes. A lot cheaper than buying the actual sponges and since you get more for a lower price you can just switch out the sponges each time during maintenance and take your time rinsing the old one out. After using a pre filter sponge my Aqua Clear filter foams are a lot cleaner and the particles trapped by the extra mechanical filtration is great.;0
85081;OK, I have spoiled my cats on the huge old 7/11 insulated cups I have 3 around the house in various areas that I refill daily with ice filled to the brim water.I know that cats will drink more water if it's not by their food bowl. (Our vet even took my recommendation and applauded me for the suggestion, she loves cats and has 2 of her own).So, I decided to try this as a treat for them as they love moving water from the bathroom faucet.Well, It works for my cats as a backup, but they still prefer my ice filled cups of water scattered around the house.The cat mate does not allow the ice to stay for very long as it melts it pretty quickly due to the motion.I would recommend this for anyone who has never spoiled their cats on ice water for sure, the waterfall is an attraction to them and my cats still drink from it, bit not after depleting the iced chilled water I had prepared for them 1st. Don't place their water by the food bowl, they will drink more water if it's placed elsewhere, and you will also notice you have to refill the water more than before.;0
136899;My cats go wild for these chews and one cat is having a eye outbreak with the herpes right now- these seem to be helping but it is taking a while to go away hence the 4 star rating.  Like that they have minimal ingredients.and that the cats like them.;0
137063;Okay, I'm rating these based on my cats' reactions to these treats. While one is the exact opposite of a picky eater (ANYTHING that is remotely edible that hits the floor is fair game in her mind), the other is a lot more finicky when it comes to snacks.  Needless to say, the feline garbage can literally inhaled these treats and was looking for more.  Cat #2 took a little more time/investigation when it came to the treat (that or she just likes for the other cat to be tormented while being held back from snatching up the treat as she sniffs at it for a minute, something I really don't put past her), but once she tried it, she was much quicker eating the second bite.  Finding a treat that both cats enjoy and is made of seemingly healthy ingredients/less crappy filler is a great thing.That said, these things are NOT cheap.  You do not get a lot for your money, though at least if you're buying them for cats,  you can break up the round treats to share them among several cats or get a couple of feedings out of one piece. I can see these being more of a special occasion snack than an every day thing - at least while on the current budget.;0
93996;This little coat is just what I wanted - and I ordered 2 of them for my Miniature Poodle and MiniMix. Possibly it's my error, I don't know  - but I am so VERY disappointed.  My furkids have several winter coats and sweaters and every single one is a MEDIUM.Maybe I should have been leery that ONLY the mediums were reduced so low in price---as the size is all wrong.These sweaters are so huge that even my 20 pounder is wallowing in this coat---I can't even begin to pull the velcro tight enough on her to keep it in place.  Needless to say the 18 pounder is lost in this coat.I would like to return but I think all the cost involved is just too much. I guess I'll just eat it!!I am very disappointed indeed;0

131750;I had always been curious about silica litters, but thought my picky kitty wouldn't tolerate.  She wouldn't do corn, wheat, pine. She has only liked A&H, brands. She drinks LOTS of water, which is wonderful for her health, but horrible for buying and throwing away clay litter. Not to mention, clay litters don't hold out long and she doesn't effectively bury anything.We decided to give this a try. IT IS AMAZING. While we sort of followed the transition instructions, she had no hesitation about switching. I no longer smell the boxes, ever. She is a huge fan (she used to inappropriately eliminate to show disapproval) we have had no incidence on this litter even after letting the box go several days too long. best of all...NO SCOOPING URINE!  This litter is great at drying liquids and solids out and eliminating odor. While the cost is a bit higher you use about 1/2 and it lasts 1.5-2x longer.I do use this in combination with a disposable bio-degradable box and I do find that the urine finds its way to the bottom of the box and soaks it more so than before, but the litter assists in this dry out. If you use similar boxes, you may want to make sure you have a water proof barrier between it and the floors.While my cat doesn't have any specific respiratory needs I did notice that she tracks this less and sneezes less. My only complaint is how difficult this is to find. Pet stores tend to be out and there isn't a reasonably priced distributor on Amazon.  It does come with a manufacturer coupon, if only I could find a place to use it!;0
139093;"We got this to supplement the diet of our Maine Coon but whether it was too ""rich"" or she just didn't like the taste, she ate it and then threw up on several occasions. Donated the remainder to my parents, whose dogs love it. So as with most pet products - your results may vary.";0

We have had others that are too small that they get in their mouth then they can't get them back out. These won't do that with small breed dogs, they are just the perfect size and are a huge hit with my dogs.If your looking for a ball to toss your small furry friend then you have found it with these. I know the frustration of having only the choice on large balls or too small balls being the only thing sold at the local pet stores, buy them here and from this company as the shipping was just as perfect as the product.;0
71652;THIS IS CLUMPING LITTER!!!If you enlarge the photo, you can see it says TIGHT CLUMPS.This is great litter, if used correctly.. You just have to shake it and be sure to not scoop the dark part of a clump, and also not scoop litter as long it is stuck to the sides or the bottom, wait until it can be shaken toward the center. I have two cts who can share one box with this, I do scoop multiple times a day , and almost never have to clean the box. I just keep adding fresh litter as I scoop, and am careful to not break up clumps! It is not dusty and has a pleasant, not-too-strong odor. You may find it for less in your local super markt.;0

6407;After reading the rave reviews for this product, I decided to give toothpaste a try before taking my recently rescued pit bull to the vet for a $300 professional cleaning. Petrodex Enzymatic  toothpaste has completely removed his rancid breath. I expect the yellowing will go away with regular brushings as well. I followed the instructions, I let Gunner sniff the toothpaste on my finger and soon he began licking it off. Next, I put some on a human toothbrush and turned it into a game. He began chewing on the toothbrush and I began secretly brushing his teeth. Now, he simply lets me brush his teeth whenever he is laying down. I simply pull back his lips and brush the exterior teeth. He eventually starts licking his teeth and I am able to brush the interior of his teeth. Thanks, Petrodex, for saving me a boat load of cash!;0

37467;I actually bought this product to line the floor in my rabbit's pen. While they do use their litter box, they're prone to accidents every once in a while but I've never had to worry about the urine leaking through to my carpet. I was also pleased with the texture. It's very comfortable for my rabbits to lay on and I would imagine that it would be great for young puppies, as well. I can't exactly vouch for it's use as a whelping mat, but if anyone needs a good liner for a bunny pen, I can highly recommend this product!;0
156892;I have four cats, and one of the four has problems with throwing up almost every kind of cat food we've tried. For the past year or so, we've been feeding her Purina One Sensitive Systems, which she tolerates better than other foods but still throws up once every 2nd or 3rd day. Needless to say, we were willing to try something new.Overall, I was really impressed with the quality of Nutrience's Grain Free cat food, and the fact that the ingredients are US-sourced is definitely a plus, too. As for the cats, all four absolutely love it - even the pickiest one, who often gets canned food instead - and the one with a touchy stomach seems to be tolerating it at least as well as the Sensitive Systems. Definitely recommended for picky eaters as well as cats with other dietary concerns!;0

47202;I have two cats, both domestic shorthair. The boy cat is 16 pounds and the girl cat is 9 pounds. Long story put short, I got tired of meowing at my bedroom door and got tired of getting up to open the bedroom door. So I had this installed and I just love it. The boy cat who is 16 pounds easily fits through with no issues at all.I went to local pet stores and the cat doors they have available are ridiculous, so expensive, no big sizes, and not many features. So I purchased from Amazon instead.The cat door is really easy to install, just follow the instructions. Or just trace the provided template onto the door and measure no more than 7 inches from below the floor + door. This is so the cats can place their paws onto the floor as they exit or enter.I use the lock features because sometimes I don't want them in my bedroom messing around and knocking things over. The lock feature is also nice if you want to trap them and get them into a pet carrier to see a vet ,)My only complaint about this is that the magnet is sometimes messed up, so as they leave or enter the room, the door swings back and forth and then stops right before the magnet. It happens occasionally, but not too often.Overall a really nice product and I highly recommend it!;0

All my cats prefer a fountain with a waterfall,even the ones who lap from the pool rather than drink from the falls.  I highly recommend the fountains and recommend filters be changed regularly.I am now very careful what my cats get as food and water.  I have had two of them develop a problem with gingivitis, so filtering the water is even more important.  I highly recommend pet owners (cat and dog)  to have a long talk with their vet about gingivitis and other teeth and diet problems.  I got careless and my pets suffered, now that I am being more careful with diet and water they are healthy and happier.  (And yes, the two who had gingivitis have recovered).;0

Just like in the wild they would not come running at the sound of an electric can-opener, they aren't going to automatically know this is the appropriate reading room.I measured the tray and it holds a little over 4 cups, probably 5 cups if you have really steady hands but I don't, so you have to take into consideration the size of the bladders in question and how often you can come to empty it.  Probably a small dog could use this all day, a larger one once.  Solid wastes aren't going to fall down between the fibers into the tray so if you will have to manually pick that up or flush it with a hose.Obviously you would want it to be where it can't be accidentally bumped....;0
122253;My dog really likes the taste of these!  He's a large dog so I give him 2 at a time, but I can tell he wants more.  My cat seems quite interested in the smell of them and seems to want one as well.My dog can be choosy about treats and it's a great testament that he enjoys these.  I love that they contain probiotics and enzymes to help with his digestion.  They do contain different flours and meals, like rye and oat, but they are very small in size, almost like a large cat treat size, which is a bit teasing to give a big dog, so I consider them more like tasty medicine than a treat and give him other treats for being good.The ingredient list looks wholesome and designed to help with digestion. It would be good to give these to dogs without digestive problems after they have to be on medications and antibiotics too.;0
81776;Well, my title says it all. I filled it with water and fortunately put it in my dish rack to test it. It leaked instantly and continuously. Nothing I did made it stop leaking. A totally useless item.;0
58039;I have an older Walker hound who has had many hunting miles put on. I noticed him getting stiffer in the joints each year. I started him on the Missing Link and it has him feeling much better. He is still ready to go when it is time to hunt! He will be on Missing Link until the end of his days.;0

40220;I think we love this more than our Chihuahua right now. This was very easy to put together with a power drill, about 10 min tops. Its light weight, but made very well and smells fantastic. Our living room smells like Cedar which is awesome. So far out little Chihuahua has chilled out on the upper deck, but she doesn't like the ladder. I may have to modify it and make it more of a ramp instead of mini stairs. Not sure most dogs will enjoy the stairs if at all. Oh well, that's why they are dogs. Our chihuahua has only camped out a few times in it right now, but I think that is because she is used to living on our couch and being spoiled. Eventually she will get used to this as her home. I think this is an exceptional little house for a small dog and it looks great and smells great as to keep pests out of it for sure. I have no complaints.....its a cool little dog house and if you're dog is scared of the upper deck...well put a plant on it as it doubles for a nice plant stand too. Right now I have a plant on top...just because I have to modify the stairs so our dog is more comfortable going up and down on it. Good product, good design, super fast shipping and made very well.;0
137332;I know there is no litter mat on the planet that will do what I want it to: stop all the litter that gets tracked out with the help of my adorable, but litter tracking champion, cats. This does its job far better than expected, and I think the high pile of the spongy stuff is what the trick is.This mat is totally waterproof, as well. One of our cats vomited on it (they're also puking in horrible places champions), and when I cleaned it off in the tub, the back stayed dry. My normal cleaning of this is to just shake it out on the back porch and rinse it with some Dr. Bronners once a month or so.I have been pleasantly surprised by this litter mat, and highly recommend it to any multi-cat home.;0
140873;She climbs it and hangs out on it daily. Great product! I would recommend it to anyone with a small or medium sized bird.;0
86713;This was recommended by a friend for my very frightened rescue dog, and she does love the taste.  I keep gradually increasing the dosage, and I can't see that she is much calmer when awake, but she sure takes longer naps.  I also have a very skittish rescue cat who likes them, if broken into small pieces, and he does seem a bit less &#34,ready to run&#34, a while after having a couple of them.;0
90005;my dogs like it, what else can i say?  i will buy more when i need it. that's all i;0
45884;I have a 90H discus tank which I bought off Craig's List.  It came with a Jebo filter which is a knockoff of an Eheim.  The Jebo is of very acceptable quality but the booger rattled like a coffee can full of rocks.  While many people claim to be able to mend these problems on the fly, my problem is what I believe everyone else experiences with magnetic impeller drive power filters - the hole in the impeller became eccentric over time and the only way to really fix it is to the buy a new impeller.  Well, that was reasonably priced at $20 but the company website states a  location in GuangDong (sp?) Province in the PRC and having had our identity stolen a few times, that ain't gonna happen, PayPal or not.  Might as well just mail my SSN to the Russian mafia.So I waited for a special on Amazon and got this guy with free shipping (I could live with the death rattle for a few more days) and it was almost $60 cheaper than my LFS.  I'd like to help the little guy out but that's ridiculous.Got the filter in record time, even with free shipping, very well packed.  Set up took about 20 minutes and it worked perfectly upon plug-in.  The priming mechanism sounded cheesy but worked perfectly.  Very nice results (my Jebo was as good) and the flow rate is much easier to adjust that my old filter.  Very quiet.  The only funky thing is the outflow nozzle - looks like the choppers from the Alien creature.  I'd much prefer the standard 90* fitting with a dispersion bar.  The fish could care less and the more than ample power is keeping the plants happy.  The angels (which have grown to be monsters) will just point into the outflow for hours on end.While the subjective performance of the filter is essentially the same as my previous filter, this is better made, more powerful and likely quieter when compared to a new Jebo.  This was a real good purchase for me.;0
38678;Seems like this company/brand is falling apart. They used to be great but they're just okay now. These used to be thin long strips that actually looked like achilles tendons (two points of insertion at 1 end and one point of attachment on the other end) as pictured. The new one is just a giant slab thats 2-3 inches wide and doesn't interest my dog at all.;0
86261;Look, dying anything in these colors is going to be a bit messy. I used to pay $80 to get my dog dyed every 3 or 4 months. Now I can do it myself at home for a fraction of the cost. It lasts a few months for me if you include the fading time. I go with a bright pink and in the end, it is bubble gum pink. All pretty. My dog is black and white so the white takes and it looks fantastic. I don't follow instructions exactly. I wash in the laundry tub for her regular bath time, MASSAGE (happy dog) the dye on (I wear disposable latex gloves), leave for 5 mins while she sits quietly in warm garage/tub, rinse and MASSAGE IN a leave-in conditioner. Best tip I can give you to make it easier on the dog - give treats off and on through out the process. Just little bits of something to make it worth their while. Everyone loves seeing her, grumpy people brighten up, she's in photo albums all over the world. I did it once on a lark but she is such an ambassador for happiness with the color that I have continued for years now. I forget what she looks like w/o color. If the process isn't fun for you, the dog will pick up on that and it won't be fun for anyone. Make it fun or skip it. Of course the dog shouldn't suffer. So for clean up, what's the big deal? It's clean up, did you expect not to? I use bleach (after the dog is out of the area (don't want her to breathe fumes) or a scrubbing cleaner with bleach. It comes out fine. Sometimes I even do it in my marble shower - again, a little scrubbing (not bleach) and it comes out fine. Anyway, love the product and will continue to buy it. If you hate the process, groomers will do it for you. If you want less permanent, use the easter egg dye (food grade, non toxic) and it will wash out in the first or second washing. Or skip it completely and go for a walk.;0
66964;I think this has to be one of the best ear cleaners on the market.  It is recommend by my vet. I have a German Shepherd with floppy ears who tends to get yeasty, smelly infections quite often and if we clean his ears with this cleaner every couple of weeks, his ears stay very healthy and happy!  Whenever either of my German Shepherds start scratching at their ears, all it takes is one good cleaning with this product and they are good as new for at least a couple of weeks.  This product has to be used as a preventative, because once your dog has an full blown ear infection, Zymox makes another product for that, which also works fantastic. Their products have saved me trips to the vet for ear infections!! I would highly recommend their products!;0
138985;After following the instructions carefully, I couldn't get this device to work no matter what! Sadly, I was really looking forward to using it too. Always seems to happen that way for me...;0
11114;For brushing our cat, this item is basically useless. For bathing our cat, this tool is indispensable. The comb gently works the shampoo through the fur (much better than my fingers alone could do) and also works well to make sure to remove the shampoo too.;0
41495;This is just the best toy invented for cats. mine loves it and knows where i store it and will ask to play. Good exercise great for tiring out the kitty.!!;0
58472;"I have purchased both the 120 count bags and the 315 count bags.  I have a 22 pound Boston Terrier/Italian Greyhound Mix that is 6 months old.  She produces a fair size movement (about the size of a fist) and have never had to ""two bag"" her using these bags, but sometimes the dog wants to go twice.Pros- The rolls are convenient and come in standard sizes that fit dispensers.- The 315 count bags come in a box with a dispenser making them easy to control.- The bags are pretty durable and can be inverted to put your hand in to grab the load.- The bags are light and can be put in the pocket or on a leash dispenser.Cons- The bags can rip, especially if the perforation between the bags pulls rather than coming apart cleanly.  They are also sometimes difficult to extract from the dispensers.- The bags in the 315 COUNT BAG PACKAGES GIVE YOU SMALLER BAGS THAN 120 COUNT BAG PACKAGES, on the order of about 2 inches shorter.  If you have a dog that produces larger excrement you are SOL if you purchase the 315 count bags.  Sometimes you cannot tie the bag if the movement is bigger than a fist.- The bags are ""biodegradable"" in a sense.  No where on the materials, packaging, or the Bags on Board website is there a mention of being biodegradable.  The only claims made are that they are leak-proof, and that they help the environment by allowing owners to pick up after the dogs and not spread bacteria.  Numerous sale sites such as Amazon state they are ""biodegradable"" but there are varying definitions.  Some users note that these bags are OXO biodegradable per company inquiries, but again it does not state that on the materials, packaging, or the Bags on Board website.  I would feel better if the company would disclose this on the package.Conventional polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) plastics will typically take hundreds of years to degrade, such as grocery bags.  If you want biodegradable bags it should meet ASTM D-6400 specification for biodegradation through composting as well as California compostable product claims.  ASTM D6400 standard requires 60% biodegradation within 180 days.  Companies such as poopbags.com produce these products, but they are very expensive. Otherwise, companies such as Green N Pack produce biodegradable bags that are OXO biodegradable.  OXO is a mix of polyolefin plastic to which has been added amounts of metal salts.  It biodegrades in about 2 to 18 months. Green N Pack Eco Friendly 200ct Green Dog Waste Bag Value Pack area available on Amazon, and are more expensive than Bags on Board, but the company does clearly state they are OXO.- There is no statement on the plastic rod that holds the bags whether it can be recycled, but I try to put in the recycle bin anyway.---------I really wish bags on board would produce a red stripe on the last bag or two.  Sometimes I have gone out with my dog and not realized it was down to the last bag and had to improvise...not fun.";0
63950;"Our six year old 92 pound Old English Bulldog  Harley and his partner in crime our 6 month old puppy, Elvis of the same breed - are the certified kings when it comes to destroying even the toughest toys.A long time fan of Nylabone products - they design toys with the dog in mind and not humans.Nylabone has been producing some of the finest, most durable dog toys here in the United States for over 50 years.That said, the Classic ""Wish bone"" has been a staple in this house for years. Our dogs just never tire of it.Our oldest Bulldog ""Harley"" is finicky about toys and loses interest after a few minutes but he'll keep this chew bone in his mouth for hours - even walking around the house with it, or holding it in his mouth while he haul his near 100 pound behind into bed.Elvis, our 6 month old Godzilla chewer can't  leave these alone either and can inflict some serious damage in record time.Nylabone is an excellent alternative to Rawhide which is processed with Formaldehyde and is fundamentally unhealthy and dangerous for dogs. - we stopped using rawhide toys years ago.Like most all Nylabone products these toys not only provide hours fun and hold up to even the most aggressive, hardcore chewers - they clean their teeth of tarter and plaque and help keep them healthy and white.

157123;Very helpful and efficient. Helped discipline my dog. Did what it said it would do.I will recommend this product to dog owners.;0
108849;I don't use carbon very often, but its nice to have on hand, these packs are pretty good sized and polish up the water quickly.;0
131488;The cats like it mostly, but they would prefer if the food were softer.  I mix and mash it up for them, but my cats prefer sloppy food.  Nothing wrong with the food...just spoiled cats.;0
70515;After switching my dogs from a food that I ignorantly assumed was a high quality food (Science Diet) I started feeding them this food. My dogs absolutely love it! Before I would put food in their bowls and throughout the day they would slowly eat it but with Chicken Soup they beg me to feed them first thing in the morning and eat it up like I'm feeding them milkbones. Awesome ingredients and apparently awesome taste. I just wish Amazon would put this food in subscribe and save!!;0
112450;The quality and finish of the Parka is very good, but the size was not. It was too small for my small dog and should probably be an extra small. The stuffed toy doggy is now wearing it.;0
90683;Let me preface this review by first pointing out that my cats have been known to eat garbage. And like most cats, they aren't too proud to groom each other's...ah...delicates. Yet when presented with fresh lovely bowls of Bora Bora Luau Sardine Cutlets, glistening with lobster consomme, they both regarded the offering with looks of pure disgust. One, the larger and braver of the two, attempted a taste, but immediately recoiled in horror, after this they retired in disdain to lounge on the sofa and stare angrily at me. Knowing how fickle my spoiled brats can be, I tried putting this out a few more times, but on each occasion I incurred the same reaction as that first time:  cold, imperial refusal -- clearly both cats are at this point trying to understand why I don't seem to get the point.  I'm giving up, with a nearly full box of this nightmare stuff still left over.  I will be donating it to my city animal shelter, where hopefully the kitties have not yet reached ultimate prima donna status and are still willing to suffer through a lobster dinner.* SIDEBAR: curiously enough, although I do mock them openly in this review, both of my felines are decidedly socialist in their food choices, and will happily eat the cheap brands of wet foods with no issues, other than preferring certain flavors over others.  This was the first time I have ever seen them both turn down the same thing.  What's in this food, anyway???;0
119901;Good product.  It was quiet.  It didn't splash.  It was great... except my little dogs didn't care for it much.  I gave it to my sister who has three cats.  I don't know if the cats are using it yet.;0
121894;I CAN ONLY SAY IT'S OK, AS I AM NOT 100% SURE WHETHER IT WORKS AS IT SHOULD OR NOT. SOMETIMES THE DOG WHINES & BARKS WHEN WEARING IT & SOMETIMES WE DO NOT GET A 'BEEP' OUT OF HER (SMILE).;0
90188;My cat is seventeen and in the early stage of kidney failure. She barely eats anything, mainly justs sucks juice out of her canned food. She barely touches her dry food or treats. She was getting so bony and I worried about her. So I decided to try the whiskas cat milk and she loves it! She also put on weight and looks healthier. She likes it cold from the fridge, I keep it in an empty pb jar and use disposable paper bowls, because she begs for it all day. Yes, if you need some extra nutrition or hydration or just a tasty treat, I'd buy some whiskas cat milk. Dogs love it too!;0
70027;the bell doesn't make much noise and the fork, spoon, knife are all plastic so it doesn't make much noise either.;0
95797;Washed and dried the windowsill, put the window perch up, instantly the perch was occupied by cats! I held my breath a bit as both of the cats hopped up on it (20 pounds of cat), but it stayed put. The perch stayed securely mounted and the cats looked very pleased. Looking at it I think I should have mounted it back a little bit further, but so far, it is holding fine. Moved the tape back a bit further, and perch is still staying out with my two cats on it. In fact, I am buying my second one.;0
38571;I bought this feeder for portion control as one of my cats overeats on dry food until he throws up when being free-fed. Having an automatic feeder allows me to make only a limited amount of food available at a time while I'm at work, sleeping, or out of town and having a pet sitter stop by just once a day. The cats like the predictability of knowing when the feeder will spit out kibble, so they no longer act as desperate for food as before. So far it works fine and the batteries are lasting much longer than I expected.There are a couple of issues though that I've noticed while using it:1) The programming is bit counter-intuitive and it sometimes seems pressing a button does the opposite thing of what you expect. I have to get the manual out every time I need to reprogram it.2) It is not theft-proof - two of my cats have figured out how to go kibble-fishing by sticking their paws up into the dispenser mechanism. I don't know if this kibble-thieving has to do with it, but the wheel got stuck a couple of times resulting in not going off at the programmed time.3) My main criticism though would be that you can't thoroughly clean the apparatus as it is not supposed to get wet and the base unit cannot be submerged in water. I wished it would come apart for washing the parts that come in contact with cat food and over time develop a slimy/dusty layer of food particles. If I could redesign just one thing on it, I would at least give it a removable, dishwasher-safe feeding dish. I like to eat from clean dishes, and I know my cats do, too.(Note: This is a review for the old Petmate Bistro that I bought a while ago. I just noticed on the product page that they changed the design of the feeder and it now includes a removable feeding dish!);0
133696;I've had this tag on my GSP for a year and it still looks great! He runs and plays in the woods or dog park, the tag has not come off the collar once. I recommend the tag for any type of cat or dog.;0

31323;I wish I could say this made a huge difference in my nervous Lab mix's behavior, but it really didn't seem to. Rescue Remedy did more for her.I also tried it on a Coonhound that I was fostering for the rescue I work with (and later ended up adopting.) She hates car rides. Okay, hates is an understatement, she totally and completely despises car rides. D.A.P made no difference with her, either. Sometimes I think half the reason my husband & I adopted her was so I wouldn't have to drive her to any more adoption events! (Little joke there.)Anyway, it was pretty costly stuff considering it didn't actually help us. It never hurts to try though.;0
16266;Worth every penny. This is the only kitty litter I will buy. My 2 cats have 4 litter boxes and one bag of this lasts over a month. I have it sent once a month to my house. Very convenient.;0
102060;Again, great reviews, but my Shih Tzu puppies and Cocker Spaniel have no interest in it.  It is easier to fill than the other kind, but then it just rolls over to the side and they spill out.  Doesn't seem like much trick to it to keep dogs entertained.  Waste of money.  It's made well.  But...;0
106057;These ball tipped scissors are much better to trim inside my dogs' ears and around their eyes, since my dogs move around while I'm trimming.  I have even used them to cut stray bangs on my youngster.;0

106899;Easy to clean out and actually surrounds their teeth, perfect doggie toothbrush! I would definitely recommend these to small breed owners.;0
27919;Have had several of these filters on different tanks. I like them. They have great flow rates per gallon and the large space in the back can also be used for other media. I see where other reviewers have stated that they are noisy but I have not had a problem with this.Also they run for a long time without problems. The bio wheel is a nice benefit as it collects a lot of good bacteria. This is one of my favorite back filters.;0
50250;I just got my fountain in today. It is replacing a Petmate Fresh Flow that broke down at the beginning of the summer. Id been using a regular water bowl and since I'm taking classes and working full time and ive been catching my kitten with her head in the toliet, i figured it was time to buy a new one.I can already see what people are saying about the resiviour, it's huge, but akward sized, and if you dont put it back on exactly right it does leak (found that out the hard way!) My own fault, but still, down a star for it.though the machine runs very quietly i was a bit put off at first because the stream of water hitting the bowl sounds like someone taking a pee! But, after some instruction manual reading i found out that you can turn the flow down, which is what i did. Silent as can be :)I love the size, i feel like with two cats I could easily leave this alone for a few days and not be concerned it will run dry.So far so good, just waiting to see my picky cat take a sip, if she doesn't in the next 12 hours as much as I like it, it goes back. Can't run the risk of her getting dehydrated because she is afraid of it. :(;0
1412;I believe in good pet food.  Have used wellness for years for both dogs and cats.  My cat likes beef but not seafood.  Go figure.  This is her fav.;0
64906;I have two very picky fuzzy children (black cats, lol) and they only eat this flavor and one other. It's very hard to find them in my local stores for such a good price. I will probably order again when I need it.;0
120159;I was buying these at Whole Foods before I thought to buy them on Amazon.  Our dogs go nuts for these and they are by far their favorite raw hides.  I highly highly recommend these!  Also, one other brand of rawhide gave our dogs diarrhea and puking, but they're always fine chewing these.;0
86351;I was hoping this would be &#34,it&#34,.  I have a one year old APBT who is not much of a player but loves basketballs.  They only last about 30 seconds.  This ball only lasted about three hours over two days.  I'm giving it two stars because it was the best three hours ever.  He had so much fun and I had so much fun watching him have fun.. I just wish it would have lasted.  I don't want to get the harder balls because of what I'm reading about tooth wear.  This came not very inflated to begin with.. not sure if that was part of the problem?  I wish they made a larger size that may be harder to grab ahold of.;0
109151;I have a one year old boxer. She liked this toy and loves to chew. Definitely have to watch her because she has chewed some small pieces off already. I would not recommend for an aggressive chewer.;0

92358;I've been using three of these mats for about six months, and they are working fine.  One thing you must pay attention to is the battery pack.  If anything touches the mat, it activates the batteries.  If  you're going to use it on a sofa with pillows, make sure the pillows don't rest against the mat or touch it or they will drain the batteries.  I had this happen the first month I used the mate on my new sofa.  The batteries lasted only two weeks. After making some adjustments and making sure the mat was clear of interference, the batteries have lasted going on five months.If you set the mat to its highest setting, the shock is a bit painful.  I fooled my brother into touching the mat I have on a chair, and he almost jumped out of his skin!  It was funny watching him jump around like a little kid, and he's 66 years old!  Another time a neighbor sat on the chair without waiting for me to remove the mat, and his hind parts got a nice blistering.  Not literal blisters, but he hopped his ass off my chair in a jiffy.  I've gotten shocked myself, and it is not pleasant.  It is like a very strong static shock.  I'm speaking of the highest setting.  The lower setting is a little milder.;0
63940;My rottie pup, also loves this chew toy.  She chews on this and the others all day.  Haven't seen my older dog chew on it, but then she's not teething.;0

17677;I've kept female rats in this cage for a few years.  The bar spacing is about 7/8&#34,, so very young and very small rats can escape.  I've got a very small adult female who's a bit of an escape artist, and I can't keep her in this cage.  She's the first out of seven females and four males that's been able to squeeze between the bars.  I'm not going to deduct one star just because I have an abnormally small rat.All in all, it's been a fantastic cage.  Plenty of room for four rats to run around, but everyone still have their own space.  The spacing still lets the rats climb the cage, so they're pretty happy.  I've never had a problem with the shelves or ramps.  They do get chewed some, but replacement parts are very easy to find from the manufacturer's website.;0
7631;It's a good size especially for the price. The cat's love it! Also, shipment was received on date given which is always a plus in my book, especially so close to Christmas...;0
18841;Got 2 medium size balls - one for each of my girls (keeshonden).  We fill the balls with Cheerios, kibble or anything they like that is small.  Sit back and watch the girls go to town.  Each has her own style of getting the goodies out and it's so much fun to watch.  Some people actually feed their finicky eaters by filling the ball with their kibble at dinnertime.  I would highly recommend this.;0
74676;My lazy bones cat LOVES this toy! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because within the first 3 minutes of play, one of the feathers got chewed in half. Now it doesn't 'fly' as well, but I plan on buying replacements. My cat is SO excited that she would give it 5 stars.;0
108322;All are picky eaters and all approve of tiki cat (specifically tiki cat Ahi Tuna). I've tried several varieties but Ahi Tuna is the only one they all beg for over and over.

14262;We had bought our lab mix a crate like this but a few sixes smaller. We had thought it would be the perfect size for him when he was full grown, but he's grown like a weed. Our first crate only had one door which was fine, but the second door has proven to be very helpful in just the month that we've had it. We put it in our bedroom for him to sleep in and its nice to have the longer side against the wall so we aren't tripping over it. We haven't put it in our car for a trip yet, but if he's going to be riding in it, the second door will make it easier to get him in and out. It also does fold up pretty easily so if you are packing to take it somewhere it doesn't take up the whole car.;0

91699;Our cats love the shredded chicken! They seem to like the shredded type better than the solid pate. Either way, this is good stuff!;0
154036;These harnesses pretty much are my go-to for small breed dogs or young puppies. Anything bigger than 25 lbs doesn't respect that movement of the harness and will continue to pull.;0
105786;This bottle rocks! Does not leak, easy to throw in the car, backpack, purse, dog pack etc. I requested and received the color I ordered, unlike one review said they were unable to request a color. I will be ordering more of these so that I will never be without one. Shipping was very fast. I fill the bottle with water, put a regular water bottle cap on it and keep it in the fridge. When I need it, I grab it, attach it to the tray part and I am good to go. I use it even when taking my pooch anywhere in the car with me so that I always have fresh water for her. Highly recommend this bottle in either size that fits your needs.;0
18856;I bought this because our dog broke the last treat dispensing ball that we bought.  That one came apart in two pieces to load the treats and was an excellent toy&#8230,until he broke it open and started eating the plastic itself!I bought this one as a replacement because it doesn't come apart like the other one so he can't break it open and eat the ball itself.  So far, he's loving it!  The kibble and/or treat pieces aren't terrible difficult to get out, but it does take him a little while (long enough to give us break from him pushing toys on our laps for a bit!).  I recommend this treat ball.Our dog is a 50 lb collie mix and can fit the entire ball in his mouth, for reference.;0
40754;I wanted to like this product.  I wanted it to work.  But after 3 weeks of very upset cats, who found many other places besides this litter box to poop on, we decided to call it quits.If your cat has ANY fear of water, do NOT buy this.  Good test--pick up your cat and hold him over the toilet.  Does it freak out?  Our cats are super afraid of the toilet, so there was no way they were going to poop in it.;0
84174;Kittens love this, but it is not something that will last more than 2 or 3 months.  The balls fall off very easily and there is no way to put them back. I have just bought a second one, because they do love it, but it is an expensive toy for only a few months of use.;0
106699;Our 20-25lb terrier managed to destroy this toy in about an hour. The thread came undone from the sides and the toy had to be thrown away. Although this toy looks and feels like the KONG Wubba it doesn't seem to hold up as well. Our Wubba is still surviving but this toy is long gone. Maybe we received a flawed one? This toy would be great for a less determined chewer but if you have a strong chewer I would suggest you save your money.;0
22680;NOT TOO MUCH CAN BE SAID HERE. HAVE USED THIS BRAND OVER THE YEARS WITHOUT PROBLEMS. MY DOGS HAVE HAD NO ADVERSE REACTIONS TO THE PRODUCT. EASY TO APPLY. NO DISCOMFORT TO THE ANIMAL. NO FLEAS HANGIN AROUN !!!;0
42838;I have a large dog so I had to buy the 4 gram sets. You just have to make sure that you have wet food in which to &#34,hide&#34, the granules for the dog's discerning palate.;0
138828;These bags work as expected, they are strong enough to hold a good size load.  I also like the dispenser, very convenient.;0
27484;"I used this product while switching a little of puppies from nursing on Mom to ""real food"". It certainly helped the transition and didn't cause diarrhea, which so many of these products do. Two of these bags took me through the weaning process for 6 large breed puppies.";0
58839;This was an awesome substitution to the annoying occasional barking of the neighbors dogs. It worked for about two weeks before the dogs didn't care about it anymore. Just wish it lasted longer;0
155701;I have a rescue dog for whom overeating is not a problem.  She's very slight and I've never had a dog care less about food.  No issues, no nothing.  But - she knows what she likes and she LOVES this food.  She was sent home from the shelter with another brand - she seemed to lose a little weight and didn't seem to care for the food at all.  Shortly after her coming home, she had her first vet checkup and I asked her doctor if he agreed that she was a little too thin.  He did.  He recommended this food.  As I say, she loves it, eats it eagerly, and has put back on the pound or two that she lost initially.  Her stools are good, her skin and fur are gorgeous.  No allergies.  I have had a lot of dogs with a lot of food issues.  I wish I'd known of this food when I had those pups.;0
107682;"I have gone through many brands of cat food for my Maine Coon mix female. She's about five years old now. I discovered this food first at a boutique type pet store... I was looking for our regular Eukanuba brand. This fancy place only had some pricey food, including Royal Canin, which I was not familiar with. I bought it anyway since I had never seen food especially for the Maine Coon breed. Well, our cat Vita loved it. She can't just scarf this food down and then throw up like she does with other food! She eats it properly and, amazingly, does not leave food in the dish. Her favorite trick is to always leave food behind and then complain that it's stale. For instance, with the Paul Newman food, she eats a few bites and then walks away. Then she comes back and camps out by her dish waiting for a few more ""fresh"" morsels. When I give her Iams, she gobbles her food like a little demon. Then I go to work or do some chores and voila, I find a pile of thrown-up kibble on the carpet. Of course, I try giving her small doses of kibble... boy, does this cat eat a lot. She is very healthy though and not too fat. The main point of my review is: so far Royal Canin Maine Coon 31 Formula is proving to be the right food for this big girl.Other important points: The price through Amazon is much better than through the pet store. The convenience of finding it online versus not knowing where the heck it might be stocked is wonderful. The most surprising thing was shipping was super fast. I ordered on Saturday night and got it Monday afternoon. How did they do that? I've never experienced such fast FREE shipping with Amazon. Also, I paid no extra sales tax. I really hope to keep this up and have the same experience. You can't beat this.";0
87344;Wow I wasn't paying attention to the item description because i was shocked at how large it is, But this is a good thing!!! My dog absolutely LOVES it. I love the scent of it, not personally but i believe its something that my dog will enjoy unlike the other chew bones you get in the stores that you can't even smell at all (Pleasant for me but not so good for my dog who likes things with interesting smells). I'm sure this will last for a few weeks, if not months. The oily coating of the bone might also be something the dog loves. Should be very flavorful for him. Will buy again.;0
95700;This cat toy is well made and hangs from a door knob.  Th cat can swing on it and play with it without getting tangled up in it.  However, my crazy kitten lost interest quickly.;0
147921;Enough pretentious French.  My beautiful black and white boxer/Boston mix looks just as cute as can be in her coordinated polka dots.  And Amazon has a poop bag bone in purple to match.  I will spare her the humiliation of dog costumes but seriously, good quality, nice look.  I'll be getting more Sassy collars and leashes if I become lame enough to want her to have a wardrobe for every occasion.;0
30162;It looks like a moth flying around and my cats leap in the air to get it! A great, cheap toy they will love.;0
56570;I bought two of these for help in transporting my 5 cats to the vet.  They tend to roll in the car.  The locking prongs on the door are getting loose after only a few trips.  If it is raining, windy or cold, you have to cover the carrier as so much of it is open.  It is no easier getting the cats through the door than most carriers - the open top ones are better.  The storage compartment on the top is helpful for carrying medications.  It would not hold my Maine Coon cat = too small.;0
101590;Needed - change once a week.I bought the stainless steel fountain and it needs thoroughly cleaned regularly -- and, these need changed..;0
38778;We got this for our lab puppy and it really helped.  She was running out of control all over our couches and biting when we would take her off.  We no longer have this problem after one warninng. Amazing!!  We have an invible fence, so she was already aware of the sounds.  The warning peeps have worked wonders.  I had all the negative feelings about getting this, but did my research and am very happy we got it.  We are going to have to get a replacement since some times are warining beep is not going off when we hit the remote, but am very happy with the results.;0
72455;I hesitated to try a cardboard kitty scratcher but have found that not only do my kitties love using this, it appears that it will last quite a long time, also.I've made my kitties happy without spending a mint.  Does it get any better?;0
94951;Worked well...left my cat's fur a little stiff and tacky but helped his skin/fur problem...not messy to use...no offensive smell.;0
9186;Allowed a substantial amount of hose for easy-hookup to a 45 gallon aquarium to keep fish during winter months. Thanks;0
36195;I love love love these harnesses I got this on the recommendation of the teacher at my dog's training class to help with his pulling and he was right. I don't even need to use this harness anymore because my dog stopped pulling all together after about 6 months of using this harness.;0
128511;I'm so happy I found this brand of play yard and these extension panels have been great.  The panels are light weight and easy to set up and reconfigure as needed.  This kind of play yard  won't work for a large dog but for an indoor play yard for a small dog they're the best I've ever found.;0
28960;I've been searching for a toy for my Chihuahua puppy. She's so tiny that's it's been next to impossible. She loves this toy. For those who have a larger puppy this toy is not for you.;0
9755;My collie does not like to be brushed because it involves pulling out that undercoat. This de-matting rake cuts through the tangles and pulls them out in a way the dog doesn't mind as much as the brush. I've used other brands but they weren't as good. This is my second time purchasing this brand, the old one lasted 5 years and stayed sharp but then I forgot and left it outside for a few weeks and it rusted.  Now I have a pyrenees/collie mix and it works great on him too.;0
139351;The leash was as advertised, Good locking mechanism and belt glides easily as dog moves about.. Nice looking and handle big enough for hand. Solid snaffle to harness or collar. Delivery and packaging without any issues.;0
132690;Easy to use and it lasts a long time.  My dog seems to like the taste! Great way for your pet to get good stuff for their digestion.;0
115220;My little puppy loves this toothpaste and doesn't mind at all when I use it to brush his teeth! In fact he actually enjoys it! What more can you ask for? ,);0
134167;i bought this for my dog and he loves it, he sleeps in in all of the time and if i tell him i am gonna sit in it when he is not in it, he runs and lunges into it...a great buy and well worth the money.;0
106694;perfect toy for my strong chewer!  Its still around after a few months unlike most of her toys!  good for fetch and tug.;0
18365;I have a small ball (green).  My puppy likes it.  She likes to observe how it rolls, she likes to get me to tug with her, and she likes to chew on it.  I cannot guarantee it will hold up when she gets her adult teeth, but for now it lasts.  I'm happy because it's gentle on her mouth and teeth.  Highly recommended, especially for puppies.;0
64187;My cat tend to used a bit but they are older cat so they are not as motivated as a young cat would i guess,  We used to have a cat house you know those thing where the cant can climb up and scratch away, that had one scratching area the cats used to tear that thing apart, I'm guessing due to the fact that they were used to using that post, is harder for them to used this or is just not as appealing,  The make of this box is simple is just a box with scratch pad,  In my opinion after looking at it I'm pretty sure the making this item didn't cost them more then 7 bucks maybe 10, but is sold for 28 almost 29 dollars,  So it's a bit overprice if you don't believe me on being overprice go ahead and order one, and then take a good look at it, is just basically the scratching pad surrounded by the box.;0
138947;I installed this in a  flower bed that was being visited by a dog who kept digging up the plants. In addition a squirrel was digging and planting acorns. The hook up was easy however there are some pointers I wish someone had let me know about. You mush have a crinkle proof hose that will take water from you hookup to the unit. There must be adequate pressure to make the water  spray the water. The spray unit is just like the ones you may already have or have seen. In order for the water to spray out horizontal we had to place the spike in the dirt at an angle. If you do that you will have to play round with the sensor as it too will be pointing toward the ground. After a few minutes of getting wet we finally got the sensor unit in the desired position. Then we had to move it far enough away so it would not spray people coming close to the flower bed. We now have the unit spraying about 15 inches off the ground and horizontally. We also adjusted the radius of the spray so that we are covering about 180 degrees. You will eventually get the hang of it so just be patient. The water hose screws into the bottom of the unit which uses a plastic hose piece. This in my judgment should have been brass as we have found occasions where the water may leak a little form that hose connection. Just a quick adjustment and the water stops leaking. Caution----don't use a set of pliers to tighten as that could damage the hose connection. We purchased a new short hoe in order to alleviate the water leak as much as possible. Don't forget to have your water on otherwise the unit will not work. We have seen the unit spray a dog, a squirrel and a bird. It does not hurt any of them and helps preserve our landscaping. Good but not perfect product.;0
656;"This is the perfect sized Chuckit for my Maltese puppy.  He can fit the balls in his mouth which he cannot do with most because of their size.  Even though it's a ""mini launcher"" it still sends the ball a fair ways, especially for a small dog.";0
49144;We used to get the Petite size Greenies for our Cairn Terrier but they used to be a little big for her and we had to break them apart for her. So Instead, we've started ordering the Teenie size Greenies and those ones are the ideal size for her. She goes absolutely crazy when it is time for her Greeny and if we forget to give her one she will make sure to remind us. These must be our dog's favorite treat ever!;0
64408;I had a hard time deciding what to write because I can't get my beautiful long hairedtuxedo girl to take ANY chew and this was no exception. It isn't this particular chewshe won't eat any. I feed her only canned cat food to help her cough up those hairballs.;0
68226;I have a couple of these sitting on top of a terrarium screen.  I love the compact size, and they work well.  No complaints, I would buy another if I needed it.;0
148694;Again, I love KONG!  They make wonderful pet toys.  As in my last review of the medium size, same goes for this.  Durable plastic gel and really cute!  This is a decent size but again I am going to have to test the waters to make sure Rusty can't swallow it.;0
63260;I have been using toenail clippers to cut the nails on my cat for years. This was not a good idea in retrospect because it would actually crush part of the nail, though she never complained.  A few months ago my cat started developing a black coating on 2 of her nails. And she was obsessively licking them. I took her to the vet and it turns out that she had a fungal infection in her nail and that the saliva actually turns the fungus black. He did not recommend any treatment at that point because it hadn't spread to all the nails just to clean it every two weeks with some liquid ear cleaner. I bought these clippers so I could sterilize them with alcohol after cutting the infected nails so it did not spread. They work great!;0
108990;My bunny will actually thump in the middle of the night if his food bowl goes empty of this rabbit food. It's his favorite and the most healthiest. I live in a rural area that has feed stores and farms. This particular bag was $4 more in the local feed store than it was on Amazon. I know it's important to support local stores but Amazon has the best price for this food! (Don't worry I still buy plenty of other items from the feed store so I am still supporting them with other purchases.) I've even ordered this food from another website before but in the end Amazon is the cheapest.Get this food for your bunny if you love them. It's healthy and has want they need to stay healthy. Also the price is another plus.;0
91816;"My dogs absolutely love this food.  And the fact that it has great ingredients makes it a winner for dinner in our house!  I am also using it for ""treats"" for agility training, in place of hot dogs or other special tidbits.  5 paws up!";0
101933;My 2 cats absolutely LOVE this little chirping bird!!  They toss it around to hear it chirp.  The first time I heard it I thought there was a real bird in the house.  I might have to buy a few more.;0
45344;"We disconnected every panel and used them to ""line"" our upper deck so puppy wouldn't fall off.  They work great.";0
82767;These are real good. My dog loves them, but they are on the softer side and don't last very long.She's always looking for more 10 seconds after eating one. It's kind of disappointing for her, really.;0
142862;"Great toy for short periods of observed play.  My adult cattledog figured out how to removed the ball almost immediately, while the puppy took several minutes.  Even so, they have not tired of playing the game.  After removing the ball quickly a few times, they will complicate the puzzle by tossing the cube around, batting at it with their paws, pouncing on it...and only then remove the ball.  They wait for me to put the ball back in, and wait until I tell them to ""Go find"".This is not for the dog who runs off with a toy and plays keep away, as the thin rubber ""bars"" of the cube could be easily chewed and ingested (my puppy had to be told not to chew it).  Of course, all of the Kyjen puzzle toys are designed to be enjoyed by dogs playing in the company of their owners.  They are excellent training tools for ""wait"", ""go find"", ""give"" and the concept of taking turns (one dog waits while the other finds).  I work my dogs on them for about 15 minutes, then put the toys away.  They stay new and exciting that way.";0
43406;Great ball to add to Bergan turbo track set. My cat plays with the track more when this ball is added, and it's even more fun to play on the track in the dark too. Brought another ball for my friend's cat so Highly recommend.;0
19637;The product works great but for the price it's nothing special... I went through it WAY too fast. Luckily I've found the same thing at my local Tractor Supply store, horse bedding which can be purchased at $6 for a 40 pound bag, literally the same freaking thing with a picture of a different animal on it. The price for this product is robbery!;0
50754;Only my younger kitty likes this (the same kitty who favors Da Bird feather toy)--but she likes it a LOT. It is a well-made toy. If your cat likes to chase after quick-moving objects, then this is a great toy for your cat--the wiry string doesn't tangle and is long-lasting, the usual Da Bird lobster clasp makes the mousey wiggle very temptingly (though sometimes I worry about it striking their eyeballs), the wire is nice and long so you can cover a lot of ground without having to move much yourself, the mouse itself is really cute and small and made of a bristly material that my cat enjoys carrying in her mouth. She's been playing with it roughly for a week now and it's in good shape. And since there are no feathers to be pulled out, I have every hope that this one can last a while (I don't leave it out for her to play at will, though).EDIT: Did they switch factories?! The first two of these that I got lasted a decent period, but the last two have lasted less than a month--the wire has separated from the tube twice in a row now. I am ordering one more, and if workmanship has indeed dropped, I doubt I'll be ordering again!;0
113910;Pros:- Soft treats can be broken up into small pieces- Don't smell terrible- Dog enjoys themCons:- The treats will dry out if they are left open or in zip lock bags overnight. We keep ours in a air tight glass jar.;0
7511;My kitty loves these treats. they are like kitty crack. Also the container makes a nice sound when shaken which my kitty has learned to come to.;0
2524;Of the various Beneful flavors, this is the one that wins the doggies vote.  It even beat the Iam's and Nutro Max weight management foods out.  It seems to have a lot of corn, corm meal, flour and whole whet. It only has chicken by product meal.  Buy hey - the kids like it that's what matters;0
116263;Can't afford chiller, so in the warmer months this actually helps to stabilize the water temp and keep it from rising too high. Quiet too.EDIT 5/21/14:Junk. Broken. Loud. Waste of money. No real cooling at all. I jammed it together but it just falls apart  over and over again. It's total garbage.;0
123351;Looks much better on the little dog in the picture. I bought one in the right size for my Golden Retriever but her fur poked through and the arms didn't stick out quite as much as I'd hoped.;0
104032;"I have four cats and I was looking for something they could all get on and be up high, seeing as how they all like to get up high as possible on the furniture in the house.  I decided on this one and I could not be happier that this was my choice.  The instructions were very easy and went together pretty quickly.  The cats loved it from the moment I opened the box.  I had their ""help"" putting it together.  They are always on this condo and there is enough room for all of them to sleep on it at the same time (which they do every day).  The favorite spots on the condo are the highest platform and little brown bag-like bed (no surprise to me because of their love of heights in my house).  My puppy even likes this condo.  She lays on the bottom and chews on her toys while the cats play above her.  This is a very sturdy cat tree (sturdier than I have even seen in pet stores).  It holds all of my cats at the same time and has held up to the puppy chewing on the bottom poles (you can't even tell she has touched it).  I recommend this to any cat owner - it is sturdy, doesn't take up much room, has sleeping places from low to high and is excellently priced.  If I could give this more than five stars, then I would!!";0
103206;I have a Shih-Tzu.The capsules are rather large. Also, he is a picky eater. As a result, I had to open the capsules and pour the contents on to his food. It works, He does not notice the fish oil.;0
48771;my cat  has to take medication twice a day and it's been a fight for years until we found those wonderful pill pockets, now  he  wants them ! great product .;0
145717;I have five dogs and all five liked this treat.  It's a little sticky coming out of the container, but it doesn't smell bad.  The main ingredients are poultry meal, palm kernel oil, brewers dried yeast, cod liver oil.  Since all my dogs are at least 60 pounds, that means they should each get two of these. This packet would not last long, and therefore that translates into a very expensive supplement.  It's a supplement the dog should do a trick for!Made in Israel.;0
12950;This dish is just what I needed for my 70 pound Labrador Retriever.  It holds just the right amount of food and she can't tip the bowl over. And,  its very easy to clean.  The opening near the bottom helps me to pick up the bowl from the floor.;0
2356;I love this product and can tell if I skip a few days by accident.  I am much more mobile and have little to no pain in my knees when I take it regularly.I am an archaeologist and rely on my knees and legs (ok, an old archaeologist, but still kicking!)...Cosamin helps me feel better and keep up with my work without having to rely on younger knees to do the things I want (and love) to do myself.;0
109771;This is very lightweight, yet very powerful for its size. It came with extra sanding drums and the adjustment key. It has 2 speeds- High and Low. I would recommend using it on the low setting until your pet is accustomed to having his claws trimmed with a power tool. It's not very noisy, but it can be a bit scary the first time you get your claws ground down. I have hard wood floors and don't like the sound of clicking nails on it, so this keeps the claws short enough to not be pesky or do damage to the floors.;0
106874;This thing works and removes a lot of hair but I'm not sure exactly which layer of fur this tool removes. It doesn't seem to remove loose hairs but instead, it pulls straight hairs off of my cat! I use this tool in conjuncture with the Kong Zoom Groom and the Safari Self Cleaning Slicker Brush. The Zoom Groom loosens the outer coat and the Slicker brush gets the undercoat that is more fuzzy, and the Groominator gets something in between the two. I don't use this tool too much though because it definitely pulls off hairs that are not ready to come off. If you use it too much, your pet will go bald.;0
109857;My Mumzy uses this particular manufacturer's products...if they are manufactured in the USA. This particular product, the coat wipes, is made in China. At least, that is what was printed upon the package once it arrived.  Therefore, Mumzy promptly returned it. My Mumzy does not purchase pet products from China. This is why a higher star rating could not have been applied. This company does make good products, however my Mumzy only purchases the one's which are made in the USA.;0
113996;We have 3 cats weighing 11, 10 and 9 pounds.  As soon as I put this together, which was SO simple to do, they were each on it.  I wondered if it would be stable being on one post, but it is completely stable and the perfect height for them to look out our living room window at the birds in our bushes.  I haven't seen them try the curved ledge for scratching yet, but I'm sure they will.  Each one of them could easily stretch out on it and scratch away.  Totally pleased with this because it is a nice compact size, sturdy and very well made.  The top perch is smaller than the base, but plenty big for my cats.;0
28826;Oh boy, does my pointer/lab love this crate! It fits perfectly in my living room, is easy to move around and clean. She pretty much just walks inside of it at night when she's ready for bed. She did not do this in her old crate.;0
75140;I purchased this because it said it was for extra large dogs.  When it arrived it had a 50 pound weight limit.  Really? that isn't a big dog, that is a medium at best.  That being said it did slow my Newf down but that is only because she knows that when a leash is on she shouldn't run.;0
43848;"This is an amazing product which I have been buying for years and there's a few pumps left of the last one I bought. When I opened the box I saw that this new bottle didn't have the plastic seal around the top. Further investigation into the product itself shows me that the oil in the new bottle is runnier than the current bottle I have! It smells different and when I squirted each one into separate clear glass bowls, I can see that the richness, the color, the smell and the thickness of the salmon oil is different! The quality of the Salmon oil in the new bottle is not like anything I have ever seen from Yummie Chummies. This bottle has either been watered down by another oil or it is something completely different to what Yummie Chummie makes. My pet has serious allergies, Yummie Chummies is the only fish oil my pet can consume. I cannot know if this is a watered down version of yummie Chummies Salmon oil or it is something completely different, because of this I cannot give to my pet cos of the sensitive skin my pet has.Shame on you seller!I tried to upload a video but the file is too big. I will retry in the morning, to me the difference of product is clear and I want you to see the real vs the fake (or watered down version) so you know to look for that rich ""sunset"" orange color in the future. I am contacting Yummie Chummie HQ to report this company and I shall update you.I will request a refund, this is the third time recently where I have had to ask for a refund from Amazon and I have serious doubts whether I want to continue buying products from them. In store the 32oz is for sale at $20 very reasonable pricesSellers are taking chances to sell a watered down product !";0
93644;I have a very hairy wolfhound/husky mix. This worked great on grooming her long hair. I would definitely recommend, but watch the instructions first so your dog isn't walking around with an uneven haircut like my poor dog is.;0
128271;UPDATE APRIL 27:  I used the vac to clean carpeting and found the suction acceptable. Let's put it this way, I found a significant amount of dirt collected in the dirt canister. My carpet also looked better after running the Bissell vac over it. My only complaint is how heavy this vac is to push around. This is common for inexpensive vacs, so it is not a true complaint. I've been spoiled by my MieleMiele Polaris S4212 Canister Vacuum Cleaner with SBD450-3 Combination Rug and Floor Toolwhich only weighs about 10 pounds. Of course the Miele does not clean my carpets as well as the Bissell so there are trade-offs.The Bissell Premier Pet vacuum cleaner is a good inexpensive vacuum cleaner. Upon arrival I had to remove the vac from its packaging and read the user booklet on how to attach the handle, hoses, and attachments to the vac. I did so.Putting the vac together was not difficult as the only thing I needed to do was attach the handle by inserting the handle onto the vac. I then pushed down on the handle and it snapped in place. For extra security a screw was provided to insert and screw into the vac body. I did this. I then attached the hose and combination dust brush and crevice tool. The hose was attached to the upper port by clipping it into the right hole. I then attached the pet cleaning attachment to the front of the vac.As to cleaning:  I did a quick sweep, using the low setting, to sweep my laminate floor. The vac demonstrated reasonably good suction.I then tried the Pet Cleaning attachment which worked very well to remove black cat hair from my chair. This is the best part of the vac as the Pet Cleaning attachment works like a charm.Noise:  The vac is a bit noisy especially after I have grown accustomed to using my Miele canister vacMiele Polaris S4212 Canister Vacuum Cleaner with SBD450-3 Combination Rug and Floor Toolwhich is quiet and lightweight. The Miele does very well for cleaning bare floors, but not as well on carpets. I have not tried the Bissell vac on carpeting, but I will do so and update this review.Weight:  The Bissell vac is heavy and handles like most upright vacs meaning you have to push the vac around a bit to get where you want to go. This is typical for almost all upright vacs so this is not a poor comment concerning the Bissell vac.Motor:  The Bissell Premier Pet vac has a 12 amp motor.Cord:  The cord rewind feature works very well.Overall, the Bissell 67F8 Rewind Premier Pet vac seems to be a good inexpensive vac for home use.Recommend with caveats given.;0

121029;I purchased the refills along with the Litter Lock.  I had one of these type of containers a long time ago, and loved it.  This one is easier to use and I experience no smell.  I only wish this refill lasted longer.  But then I have four cats, so it goes fast. Scoop, deposit, lock it up and walk away.  So easy and the scoop is hanging right on the litter lock.  The refill is so easy to replace, the only hard part of all this process is scooping up the waste!!  Who ever invented this whole system, well thank you!!5 pack of Litter Locker Plus Refill Cartridge;0
45408;These adult dog food cans are smaller than what I normally buy for my dogs. And a bit more runny. But I gave both my dogs, an Australian shepherd and pit bull mix, dry food and then pour this over there dog food. Because of the more wet like consistency it poured out of the can very easily and I didn't need to use a utensil to get the dog food out of the can.You can see beef chunks and rice in the gravy. And the smell wasn't too over powering at all. My dogs really loved it and both ate a can each in one sitting, dry dog food and all they licked their dishes clean.There are recommended daily feeding amounts for dog size based on pounds on the back of the can but I mostly give my dogs a can as a treat and not as there daily food.  But for a 50 lb dog it says feed 3-1/2 cans of this a day, 75 lb 4-3/4 cans a day, 100 lb 6 cans of a day, 150lbs  8-1/4 cans a day. So that can really add up if you take there recommendations. It wants you to feed this amount to the dog into 2 or more feedings in the day.Overall my dogs loved the tasted, and I do like the Purina brand;0
18888;My English Bulldog loves this toy and it entertains him.  We don't put a lot of treats in it we use his dog kibble and it doesn't take much.  He chews on it a bit but it is a bit big for him to destroy (THANKFULLY). When it doesn't have treats in it he uses it like any ball playing fetch and rolling it around the house.;0
16055;I bought this as a lightning deal, without really looking at the purpose of it.  I foster dogs, so I frequently buy dog toys. This is a ball, with a circular hole through the enter. My pitbull loves it.  I shoved a few dog bones in it that I knew would stay and she plays with it until she gets them out.  The only thing I hate, and I hate about all sphere shaped dog toys is that they role under the couch and the dog scratches the hard wood floor trying to get at them! For that reason, this might have to be my last ball type toy!  This is the tough, high quality Kong material Kong buyers are used to, and should last many, many, many years.  Aside from specifically shaped treats, I'm not sure what else you could put in the center though.  That is why I am giving this only four stars.  I guess you could probably put a rope through it and tie it on both ends, or just use it for catch outside.  If you want a toy to stuff treats in, stick to the classic. (Oh, there she goes, scratching my floors again!);0
156745;it doesn't love them as much.This worked better for them than the fishy kind, but not as great as I'd hoped. We use this as a snack, but not as a meal, their bellies just can't handle it for some reason.;0
117060;My vet had put one of my cats on the Hill's prescription c/d diet for urinary health, so I thought I'd switch my other cats to the Hill's Science diet for senior cats. Long story short, they couldn't keep the food down! (And yes, I changed the food gradually.) It was awful, an I immediately retuned both foods. The cat with urniary isses is now on a Royal Canin urinary health food from my vet, and the others are back on their previous food (Earthborn Holistic, grain free). My Akita was also on Earthborn Holistic, but I thought I'd try the Hill's. This was at the same time as the cat food, and once I saw how badly the cats reacted, I decided against giving this to him. I didn't help that the bag was torn open and there was food loose inside the shipping box as well. After the poor reaction from my cats I researched the Hill's food (there's not a lot of info on cat food, but lots on dog food). It turns out that the earthborn is rated a 4-star food (out of 5), while the Hill's food is only 2.5 stars. Your experience may differ, but I am steering clear of this brand.;0
153583;The dog loves these but finds them a little tricky to eat.  They aren't exactly strips, more like tough, flat squarish hunks of jerky.  They seem to be slightly scored but aren't easy to tear and there's the rub.  For my little doxipoo they're hard to chew (and he doesn't have bad teeth) so I have to tear them into smaller chunks.  My dog hasn't choked on them, but he's dropped pieces that are too big for him to swallow, rather then gnaw on them.They come divided in four baggies which is kind of nice, AND I JUST discovered there IS a resealable bag included, which is great since once the baggie is open it's supposed to be refrigerated!So they're OK, and maybe a BIT better than OK, but like an awful lot of dog food they seem pretty pricey to me at $13 (currently) for a 12-oz bag.  However I do prefer these to treats that can't be divided, like snausages.;0
120107;Great shampoo for my guinea pigs when it's bath time. This stuff really is awesome! I totally recommend this stuff.;0
9875;I love this spray.  It smells great and I think it's gender neutral for pets.  I use it withCologne Drops Floral Scent for Dogsand they work great together.  Once the spray has dissipated, the drops keep it going.  When my dog gets damp, it revives the drops.  If your dog is stinky when clean, switch to a meat first dog food and see if that helps.  It doesn't have to be expensive.  For Hounds try Eukenuba Lamb & Rice.  It worked for my sisters beagle, and beagles stink!Eukanuba Adult Nat Lamb and Rice for Dogs, 30-PoundFor my english pointer, Purina One Lamb & Rice did the trick.Purina One Lamb & Rice Dog Food, 4-Pound Bags (Pack of 6).

111766;This is a cheaper dog bed, so I didn't expect much. The fabric cover rips very very easily at the touch of a dogs nail, so the bed looks pretty awful even though my dogs only use this on very rare occasions. However, for the price, it still deserves 3 stars.;0
130497;These tubes are a bit tall for my 2 cats to use. It would be nice if they were a little shorter.I have a Siamese with long thin legs. He is not ready for the tubes yet and I've had the food puzzle for several weeks.I think in time these may work. I wish I had waited on purchasing these instead of buying both items at the same time.;0
63043;My cat loves this stuff.  She has diabetes and these are the best treats for her because they are all protein and no carbs.  I test her blood for glucose and have to prick her ears.  This is her reward and she knows that if she puts up with me she gets a nice, fat free, carb free delicious treat.  Take care of your pets and give them nutritious freeze dried meat/chicken rather than the junk food treats that are loaded with uneeded carbs.Also, this is a great price and a large bag lasts for a long time.  Cat and dog Pure Bites are exactly the same with larger pieces in the bag for dogs.  Just break them up and kitties love them too.  I also use the crushed treats to top off a meal and make it tastier.When my friend's bring their dogs by, they always get some too.  All of the pets love this product!!!;0
28117;Four rats have a lot of excretions.  We got these to help line their cage. They use a litter box for #2 but will pee anywhere and everywhere. Rat pee smells disgusting and it is a lot of work to keep the cage clean. By using these pads we hoped to lure them into peeing on the pads instead of randomly going wherever they please.  They did pee on them, though I think largely by coincidence.  They mainly tore them up and used them as a comfy bed.  So for entertainment value alone for the rats, I have to give 5 stars. I would get them again but not with any hope or expectation of wee wee control for rats.;0
33248;I've purchased this litter twice now and will be trying it a few more times just because it is so cheap. Both bags that I have received have been extremely dusty and cat urine tends to stick to the bottom of the litter box. On the second bag, we mixed this with some of our regular litter and it seemed to work better because the cat urine did not stick to the litter box. This litter also tracks more than any other litter we have used. I'm not sure if we just need to try different litter mats or if this is just the nature of the litter. With all of the great reviews on this litter I was hoping for an amazing product. The only reason why I give this litter 3 stars is because of the price.;0
77538;good product;0
135415;Our pug/boston mix puppy really loved this toy, which is probably why it was completely destroyed in about 1 month. She was in a &#34,chewing&#34, phase as evidenced by the hole in my sofa, but dog toys should still last a bit longer. Overall though, for the price it was fine, and she really enjoyed it.;0
65136;Our cat loves these treats! The moist and soft texture is a joy for our cat every time she feasts upon them. This is also used when we want our cat to do some cat tricks.They look so delicious for our cat that I wish human food made us that crazy!;0
105702;I much prefer the regular Nature's Miracle to the Urine Destroyer as the Urine Destroyer has a potent, long lasting scent.  With the original NM, the scent is light enough that one can take a whiff to see if the urine odor has been eliminated but the Urine Destroyer masks any remaining urine scent so it's difficult to tell if more product is needed until after the treated area is dry.The scent is too overpowering and rather unpleasant.  It reminds me of Febreeze products, which I find obnoxious.I highly recommend the regular NM but can't say the same for the urine destroyer.;0
133643;Molly Mutt has outstanding products, and this is no exception. As a bonus, this not only products your duvet stuffing from spills, drools, or accidents, but all helps block odor. I'd suggest just the armor and duvet, rather than the mesh, armor, and duvet... the armor takes on both the role it's designed for, and that of the mesh.;0
103456;At first my old cat wouldn't have anything to do with it, but after my younger and much bigger cat went it once, the older one just took it over and it's now her house. The younger cat is now relagated to the other open bed. Seniority rules.;0

130052;My dog is a bit shy about eating in front of people, so I should have known that he would not like these.  He didn't.  He looked at me like I was crazy.  I tried to make him try it, but he resisted and then I felt bad about doing it.One time during a bad storm he was hiding under my desk and he licked it and seemed to like it, but I haven't got him to do it since.I think the product is probably good - and there's a lot in it and it looks safe enough - it's like a deodorant roller ball - but my dog is just too shy.My cat liked it.  I wasn't sure how good it was for cats though so I didn't let her try it again.  They should make these for cats though - I had a cat that would lick her fur off, this would have been great to help divert her.It's a lot neater to keep in your pocket than regular treats.  It would be great for training a dog if you had a dog that would lick it.;0
23283;My dog has worn boots for quite some time and we have tried many other brands, but always seem to come back to Muttluks - they wear well (they will not last forever, but neither do human shoes) and keep his feet clean and dry.  He does not mind these at all (there have been others that seem to impact his walking).  Usually these are for the really cold or snowy days, but it also works for the times when the snow is melting and things are getting ugly out there.  Another plus, they do bring a smile to almost everybody that walks by when we are out walking :-);0

127014;These test strips are good for getting an overview of a tanks status.  Once you know your particular tank(s) well you know what the values should be and with these you can check several parameters at once quickly and easily.  The price makes them economical enough to use regularly, rather than only testing when you suspect a problem.  You may want to have more precise liquid test kits for monitoring things when making changes, or if these indicate a problem, but dip strips are handy and these have proved quite consistent and reasonably accurate.These do not indicate the presence or level of ammonia, and I don't trust dip strips for that in any case.  If ammonia may be an issue I suggest a good liquid test kit.;0
93351;He loved these things, but he was allergic to something and we had to find out what. Not real sure if it was these or not but he loved them;0
42316;I have many different clickers, but this is my favorite so far.  It is a pretty loud click -- drives my housemates bonkers when I train inside.  For outside, it is always my go-to clicker, though.  My dog hears it easily above any background noise (even highway traffic) and it is the most consistant clicker I have tried.  The button is very easy to find, so I am never fumbling, and it clicks with exactly the same pitch, timing, etc., every single time.  It is easy to double-click with, too, if you want a slightly different cue (the dog has to be pretty in tune to pick up on a click vs. double-click, but if your dog does then it is a cool thing to have).  It is also a very comfortable clicker to hold on to, compared to bulkier or squarish clickers.  My only complaint is that StarMark hasn't figured out a feature like another company has that allows me to attach the clicker to one of my fingers so that my hands are almost free while working.  Still, I recommend this clicker hands-down over anything else I have tried on the market today (and I have tried a lot).;0
96751;This was great for my Boston when she was only a baby.  When she was about 5/6 mos old she started chewing chunks off.  A Boston chewer will go right through the rubber toys in a matter of minutes;0
13837;My dog loves this. I gave it to him as a replacement for his nylabone puppy bones. He loves the type with some flex. It is the perfect size for my 7 month old Frenchie/Pug. It is a great alternative to treats and edible chews. My dog does well with a monster mouth chew toy filled with treats, but not so much with an edible chew. He will chew on those for awhile and then try to swallow them while they are still too large. These are better, because he doesn't always need treats and it is safer for dogs like him who could choke themselves. It also encourages constructive chewing. I recommend using these for moderate chewers like my dog.;0
30529;"My boys are two brothers from the same litter, now about 9 months old. I first tried feeding them in a free-feed style. Wonderful for one brother, but the other scarfs down the food as though he hasn't eaten in weeks. Over time, he became overweight and more lazy. The healthy-weighted sibling became restless, as he had more energy than his overweight brother. This restlessness led to destructiveness. I had to do something quickly - a combined diet limitation along with this active food ball appeared to be worth a shot.This feeding ball solves the problems of both of my boys. Picasso, the healthy energetic one, loves tossing the food ball around. He bats the bits of food across our wood floors and pounces on the kibble as though each were a tiny mouse attempting to evade him.Vincent, my overweight one, was a bit more lethargic at first. He did not want to toss the ball, but he would walk around and eat the kibble bits that Picasso had knocked out of the ball. As his weight has been declining, he is starting to bat at the food ball more and grow more proactive in getting his own food. I was worried at first that he didn't ""get"" the food ball, but with Picasso's help he seems to be fine now.RESULTSThey do not cry for food as they used to before. Sometimes they'll leave some food in the ball, and they know it is there but not worth their effort to get it out. Later - either from boredom or hunger - they finish off the food in the ball. Vincent seems to be decreasing in weight. I have not weighed him but his body shape is improving to a healthier look.Picasso exerts a lot of energy playing with his food. His behavior is vastly improved when I feed him with the food ball. Sometimes I'll feed him early just to distract him while I'm trying to do something he would normally try to get his nose into.In the mornings I'll often just feed them in their bowls, and the evening is food ball time. This is purely because my boys start scratching at my door at 6:30 in the morning - an hour before my alarm clock - and so I'm half asleep and lack the dexterity to get the food into the ball at that hour. They don't seem to be confused by the different feeding methods.I had bought them two food balls thinking each would have their own. Well, through their playing with the ball, I can't seem to find the second one. Now I feed both through one ball and it seems to be working out fine.EASE OF USEThere's a handy notch to help change the amount of food that comes out. There are 3 large and 3 small holes, and you are able to show only the large or small at a time, or fractions of each. My kibble is shaped like a 3 sided ninja star, so I leave it on the large setting, but slimmed down to about 75% open. Just keep an eye on the cats - if they start to get frustrated, open it up a little bit more.I use a measuring cup to pour the kibble into the ball. A liquid measuring cup would be best with the pouring spout, because the opening is relatively small and sometimes I get kibble everywhere if I'm in a rush or not paying attention.TO SUM UPI highly recommend giving this food ball a try. I have paid this price for some of their cat toys. It keeps the boys more active, satisfies Picasso's hunting desires, and is keeping Vincent's weight in check. At the worst case scenario, you have another cat toy for them to toss around the house.";0
12162;After 1 year my cat STILL plays with this on his own, compared to most other toys the cats got bored using & stopped using (even using rotation method), so I suggest this toy is a must for any cat owner.Don't worry if this toy's string isn't the right length - use your brain(!) via either shorten or lengthen the string (duh!).  I used this atop a hall-cubbard door which the top of that door is 4 feet above the floor, the mouse dangles 6 inches above ground which is perfect because cat grabs it & lays down clutching the squealing mouse because the string STRETCHES(+).  So I didnt hang it from a tall door but if I did then I would simply insert kite string up near the top of this toy, make the cut/knots up high so the cat wont focus on the knots.Its been hanging & squeaking for a year & still squeaking strong as new so I guess it's a good battery inside.  This is one of the few toys thats been worth buying.;0
101901;I bought the Large for my 65lb dog.  It fits right but the elastic straps in the back are uncomfortable for him.  He refuses to pee when the straps are linked around his legs and he walks funny like he's trying to shake them off.  But they're not really necessary for it to stay on so I just don't bother using them.The hood is a little ridiculous.But in short, it keeps him dry and is durable and does what I need it to.  The orange is good when we're out in the woods so that hunters can spot him.;0

I admit it works so good I probably don't clean it as often as I should. Filters last with rinsing, replacements are easy to do. I have one running in the bedroom now, the bubbler makes more noise than this. Very satisfied.;0
98261;Our GSP loved this but promptly destroyed it within around 10 minutes. Not worth the money for such a short life.;0
30845;"Cats love investigating holes, so this toy looks like a great concept. One out of my four cats will actually play with this toy regularly on his own, so it is getting used at my house for its intended purpose, but not a full success. Two out of the other three kitties at the house completely ignore it and one will play with it occasionally when I'm in the same room and interacting with it, so I guess it very much depends on your cat's temperament how well they will interact with it. The one that does play with it regularly mostly does so at night, ""hunting"" for his toys and bringing them to my bedroom for me to find and place back into the box in the morning.Based on other reviews, there may be some safety issues with this item, though I haven't had any with my particular piece. It is made from solid wood, very sturdy and (at least the one I have) nicely put together with no nails sticking out like some other people have reported on theirs. None of my kitties ever got their paws stuck in it either, but they are all adults and not kittens any more.I see some reviews are cautioning that the rubber balls that come with it can get chewed up and swallowed, causing expensive trips to the vet to have them removed surgically. My cats haven't chewed up the balls and as soon as I saw those reviews I took them away, so it hasn't been a problem for me, but I can see how this could happen with the balls that come with the toy. Instead of the rubber balls, I'm using fluffy pompom-style balls with it, which my cat loves to carry around. He will dig them out of the box and bring them to me one at a time, meowing for attention and looking rather proud over his ""catch."" Putting their favorite toys and/or some treats into the box can increase their interest in it.";0

7742;"I've never been one for supplements... I dunno, sometimes I think it's all ""in your head."" So when my Siberian husky, River, was diagnosed with a luxating patella (slipping kneecap), I was worried I'd have to put her on some damaging long-term medicine (it wasn't ""bad enough"" to warrant surgery). Surprisingly, the vet recommended a joint supplement, but the one I got from him was a chewable meat-like treat, and River ate it at the beginning, but after a few days turned her nose up at it.I didn't want to just give up, because River had gained a lot of weight from lack of activity.So I looked for either a pill or something less ""treat-like"" (yeah, she's strange like that!). I found this. After about a month of giving her two chewable pills, (which she readily eats!), one in the AM and one in the PM, she's playing almost like her old self again. Not 100%, but she PLAYS now instead of just laying while the other 4 huskies dance around her.Now, to get that extra weight off... :)Cosequin has made me a believer!";0

I was desperate for something to get the both of them moving and losing some pounds when I found this toy. From the reviews I read and the price, I figured it was worth a try. I can't believe something so simple turned out to be just what I needed! My cats go NUTS for this thing! It is true to its name, as it really gets them dancing. They can chase it for hours. As soon as I pick it up, I've got their immediate attention. They both just love it, and its fun for me to watch them jumping and diving and running like a couple of kittens again.It is also very sturdy. This toy takes quite a bit of abuse and I've seen very little wear so far. I would definitely recommend this toy!;0

69745;We have two adult, female dogs: a 28-pound, 13-year old cockapoo (Brandy) and a 21-pound, 12-year old miniature schnauzer (Rosie). They suffer skin problems, gas, indigestion and irritable bowel syndrome.Isn't getting old grand?The days of eating rich and juicy table scraps are past. Come to think of it, the days of our family eating rich foods has past as well. Anyway, we buy dog food and treats that won't upset Brandy and Rosie's stomach.On the advice of our veterinarian, we switched to theNatural Balance Potato and Duck Formula Dog Treatsafter our dogs developed skin problems. We also purchased theNatural Balance Turkey, Oatmeal and Cranberry Dog Treats. Our dogs liked the turkey, oatmeal and cranberry treats but our mini-schnauzer continued to scratch away.Next, we tried Nature Balance'sSweet Potato and Fish Formulaand the Sweet Potato and Bison Meal Formula, which is a grain-free treat with no corn, soy, or wheat. We now alternate between these formulas and thePotato and Duck Formulafor both dogs.Brandy and Rosie receive a treat after relieving themselves in the back yard, so they get 4-5 of these treats per day. The Natural Balance dog treats are smaller than most of the other brands we purchased before. That has been a nice change since we do not want to feed the dogs too many calories outside their regular evening meal.In summary, we recommend all of these Nature Balance formulas. TheNatural Balance Turkey, Oatmeal and Cranberry Dog Treatsis the only formula we no longer buy for our mini-schnauzer, although our cockapoo can still eat them.Rating: Five stars.;0

Everyone has to find the method that works best for their dog and for mine this was just the trick. I'd recommend these for anyone who wants an affordable set of weave poles.;0
97072;These were difficult for my puppy to chew on and would become slimy when she ate them.  She never did chew a one totally.;0
81866;My 2 cats LOVE this fountain. They used to drive me crazy begging for me to turn on the water at the sink, but now they have fresh, running water all the time! I like it because it is quiet and easy to clean.;0
86448;It is a good idea, but a little cumbersome with the bag holder on the leash. Couldn't they just make the leash, bags/holder and clip an altogether item?;0
132140;Oh, boy! Does this ever go over with my two cats! Normally, I just give them dry  cat food a couple times a day. Then I start to feel sorry for them. So, when I'm in a store and strolling through the pet food isle, I pick up a few cat treat items. Tonight it was Whiskas Filet Mignon Savory Pate. They loved it! Couldn't be any  better!Gary Peterson;0
8301;this oil has done wonders for my dogs coat, but it will spoil. i keep it in the fridge, but still write the date on the bottom and watch to make sure it doesnt go bad. lasts us about 8 weeks.;0
16546;Squeaky is still playing with this toy.  She loves jumping and grabbing it over and over.  Since I am disabled, I can tire her out for naps when I want her to be still!;0
67020;I highly recommend this item. I paid $ 54.53 for it here at Amazon plus free shipping.  The height fits almost perfectly even with my window seal.... Perfect height for my cat to watch the birds. Love that it has the condo, scratching post, rope toy, etc... It is a great item.;0
48878;My dogs prefer these to all the other greenie type brands and they don't get sick from these as they have from others. So I pay the higher price for this brand name. It does help with dog breath.;0
29235;I use this in quarantine tanks and I am not totally convinced that it works as well as the manufacturer claims. I have not had it reduce nitrates, but it does help with other issues to some degree. Of course your best bet is to use a high quality carbon and GFO in a reactor and build your biological filtration (biopellets have worked wonders), however, in quarantine tanks and hospital tanks, this is a little difficult. I use this, carbon, and prime with large water changes to keep pollution down. However, when medicating, all you have are the water changes.;0
8710;I am breeding ramshorn snails for my turtle.  They are so messy and it makes cleaning a tank tough stuff once the tiny snails start to hatch.  This is perfect and it is certainly not taking up any room in my 125 gallon tank.  It's large enough for a few snails and live plants.  The water stays fresh,the old food and waste flows out of the bottom, but the snails stay put.  I'm considering drilling some larger holes so the waste flows out even faster.  I'm not sure if the baby snails can get through the openings, but that certainly won't be the end of the world as there are a ton of them and they are going to be snacks anyway.I love how instead of floating about the tank, the side &#34,suctions&#34, itself onto the wall.;0
64156;I LOVE this laser, perfect shape to hold in your hand for awhile & doesn't strain your hand like others. I got it for a little cheaper at a local store, and would definitely recommend it!;0
108673;Best litter box ever! I have two cats and I keep two boxes. One of my cats is, how shall I put this...ok, he's fat! But I adopted him when he was 11, and he was already fat. Anyway, he is a big fellow, but exceptionally neat. He loves these huge boxes, as he fits all the way in (no sticking his head out of the opening while he is going) and he can really move around and cover everything when he is finished.  My other cat is very long and skinny. He likes these too.With a regular hooded box, you have to unlock and remove the hood to clean (and I clean twice daily). Because of the way my big guy urinates, he often hit the seam where the hood met the pan, so there would be nasty stinky cat urine in the seam and I had to be very careful not to get any on my carpet when cleaning. With these pans, you just open up the &#34,sun roof&#34, to clean!I did remove and discard the clear plastic flaps that cover the entrance, but that was very simple to do and required almost no effort.These are well made and a great value as well!;0
6460;This is the cheapest price per ounce you're going to find on enzymatic dog toothpaste. I have purchased this twice. The first order came in a metal tube, similar to what oil paints for art come in. The second came in a plastic tube like most human toothpaste. I have to say I prefer the plastic tube, but it doesn't seem like you get a choice. Sometimes it will be metal, other times plastic. The product inside is the same for both, and works well. My dog enjoys the taste as well. Would definitely recommend.;0
147357;Puppy caries it around and plays with it and does not finish it.  I usually find what is left of it and have to throw it out.;0
63427;We switched our cats to this food because we had a few overweight kitties and we wanted to buy a good quality food that would help them lose weight at a safe rate.  The cats love the taste and went to it right away and the overweight cats have been losing weight steadily, while the other maintains a healthy weight.;0
142159;This item is hands down the best $50 I have spent on my dog.  I use it every day (sometimes twice) and have been for about 2 months now.  It is made very well and has high quality components.  The walkydog is adjustable to fit almost any size dog.  The easy disconnect feature is extremely handy when you stop and want to disconnect while still being away from home.*****My dog is a puller and he dashes for rabbits and the WalkyDog can handle it all.  When he really jumps around I do feel the tension and the bike leaning but it is not unbearable and the springs loaded inside the unit absorb most of the shock of the pull.;0
100270;I feel great giving my pups their daily vitamins and they come running every morning for what they perceive to be a 'treat'.;0
140441;I got a puppy with a picky appetite. I went through the food the breeder sent him home with (Taste of the Wild Grain-Free for Puppy) only to find he refused to eat it. Same thing withBlue Buffalo Wilderness Puppy- and both of these are excellent, well rated foods with high end ingredients.  I tried wet foods, no dice. I triedCanyon Creek Ranch Natural Turkey & Barley Dry Puppy Foodand while the puppy ate it, the ingredients spooked me.Finally, I went with the brand that my cat has been thriving on, Wellness. I was happy to see that the ingredients list is full of good things, no grain, no fillers, or other things that would make me worry. The puppy also dances around the food bowl when he sees the kibble scoop come out. He's now in danger of becoming a pig, so I supplement his diet with fresh peas and carrots, which he loves.Another review mentioned gas, which my puppy does indeed have once every few days. This was the same on the other two high end foods, TotW and BBW - I don't know if it's just something common to puppies on high quality kibble. It's not a constant weapon-of-mass-eruptions gas bombardment, but he will issue a silent but deadly at least once a week.  It's not very noteworthy, but all dogs are different and have different reactions to foods at times.The primary ingredient is chicken - and some dogs need a more novel protein to avoid stomach upset and gas, so your mileage may vary.[Edit] On that note, let me add that the Barkspawn's poop never quite firmed up on this food. Finally, in some frustration, I switched again toBlue Buffalo Dry Food for Puppies, Lamb & Oatmeal Recipe. I'm glad to say that the poop report is now clear skies, with chance of clouds (gas!) - that hasn't changed.  Entirely possible that I managed to get yet another dog with chicken allergy, and Wellness does not seem to make a lamb based puppy kibble.;0
53233;Two of my three dogs really like these little treats.  They are made in the USA, and only have venison and vegetable glycerine as ingredients.  They are small and on the soft side, and the two dogs that like them are very enthusiastic.;0
38121;My German Shepard loves this. In the winter time it keep her of the cold floor and in the summer time it is cool enough since air can flow through the bottom . Very lightweight so it easy to move when you need to vacuum under it;0
35733;My cats love this toy!  They swat it, sit on it, lay on it, and chase the ball over and over.  The toy is well made, and looks to be durable.  The scratch pad is a big hit too, they love to scratch on it!  I decided to buy this because of the lighted ball, I thought it would be attractive to the cats.  I was right, they are fascinated with the lighted ball.  And I like that they scratch the pad & not my furniture.  Very good cat toy!  Cat owners, I highly recommend this toy.;0
146332;I wash my pup let let him go a week, give him one of these for any he may have picked up outside the following week, and wash him again the week after. It's a pretty effective flea fighting system. One which took me half the flea season to figure out. The product works as specified. I placed my second order this week in fact!;0
14942;Product arrived as promised.  Seller described it to a tee.  Directions were easy to follow. However, I had to call PetSafe's technical support for instructions on how it works.  Their technical support person was spot on. Very professional & courteous.  I love this collar!  What's more it works!;0
119018;Great product! Bought this to replace a previous water bottle that was kept on the cage by a metal spring and clips and had to be taken off, unscrewed to be filled up. It was a pain and it ended up breaking anyways. Have not had any problems with leaking as a few people had mentioned. I hope it lasts for a while but I would buy another one to replace it anyways.It is great that this thing fills up from the top...although if I had one complaint it would be that the top/cap just sits on the bottle. It  does not screw on. There is a tab you can pop up so you actually do not even have to take the whole top/cap off, but since it does not screw on in the first place it just ends up being easier to take it off anyways. This is minor and probably more personal preference than anything but it just seems a bit senseless to me.;0
74077;This ball works great for the chuckit launcher.. however if your dog is used to tennis balls, these are smooth and harder to pick up;0
84792;I gave my dogs these with their food for a little under a month and they ate them no problem. The chews are soft and easy to administer. However, I can't say they made a difference in my dogs. I was hoping probiotics would help firm up my dachshund's stools and reduce gassiness, but there was no change. They also had no effect on the persistent skin irritation on her one toe. The other dog seemed about the same too. I also could not find an expiration date on them, a feature which many sources say to look for in probiotics because they don't remain effective forever. I'm trying a sprinkle-on powder with an expiration date now instead.;0
128924;I bought all of the Kong cozie toys for my puppy chow.  He can't get his mouth around the squeaker and so he has no interest in them.  Disappointed, yes hopefully I can teach him how but no luck so far.;0
146720;These Nature's Miracle Scent Release Training pads work great with my Shih Tzu puppy, not the &#34,lavender scent&#34, but these &#34,grass&#34, scent.  I had a new puppy and found myself home bound due to complications of a badly broken ankle.  She had to be house trained rather than what I planned.I was first &#34,home alone&#34, and unable to leave in August. Throughout the first period of online shopping, Amazon was essential. I tried a competitor and two of the items of the six ordered did not arrive...ever.  I have ordered groceries to durable medical equipment to pain relief items from my Amazon account since my accident.Then, when complications arose, I thought I would have to give up my beloved companion pet.  Again, Amazon came to the rescue.  The UPS to the front door is essential for home bound individuals.  Back to the subject, Amazon's prices on many items, especially for pets, are not lower anywhere that I have found online or offline.;0
19738;My dog will basically eat almost anything- rocks, dirt, tree bark, plactic...You get the idea. Im not sure the fact that she likes them means a whole lot. I switched to them because I read that pork skin is more digestible than rawhide...With all of the rocks, tree bark, plastic, etc she is eating I thought a more digestible snack was a good plan. Its a bit freaky that the package admonishes the human to WASH HANDS THOROUGHLY after touching them...Ummmm...should my dog be eating something that I shouldn't have on my hands??!! Makes you wonder...;0
109076;These are great products for powerful chewers like my beagles (yes I did say beagles)  They love these bones and chew and play with them often.  They last a long time.;0
142267;"I'm not sure if there are more effective anti-barking products out there, but the HAVAHART ULTRASONIC BASIC does get my Shiba's attention.For the most part, she's quiet but whenever a stranger comes into the office or the doorbell rings she'll start barking. I figured this might help and it does, somewhat.First of all, it's easy to set up and comes with 2 AA batteries. You put it into auto mode at first and it will cycle through the 5 different frequencies until you find the one that your dog responds to. They'll look up or at the device and then you just press the ""frequency selector"" button to set it.You have a choice of manual or auto correction, the auto only works for barking. I've haven't used the auto mode because there aren't enough outbreaks of barking for me to keep it on.When she does start barking I use the manual setting, I just hit the power and press the ""Manual Correction"" button on the unit. It gets my Shiba's attention for a second and then she goes back to barking. I'll also issue the ""NO"" command together with HAVAHART, and that will sometimes get her to stop.In my case, it works better then my just saying ""NO"" and a lot less messier than getting a spray bottle and squirting her with water, which I've read is another way to stop unwanted behavior, so I'm giving it a solid 4-stars.According to the directions, there is a small percentage of dogs that will NOT be distracted by the HAVAHART ULTRASONIC BASIC TRAINER so keep that in mind.";0
56994;We tried this on my mother-in-laws dachshund pup and she had 5 ticks on her and it didn't work on any of them. We were not using the product wrong...it just did not work.;0
141187;I used to keep my bags of dog and cat food sitting on my kitchen floor. One friend finally said &#34,Why don't you do something with them?&#34, So I looked on Amazon and found this set. It's perfect for a large bag of dog food (16lb - 20lb) and a smaller bag of cat food. It's also on wheels so it's easy to pull out to feed the pets, then just roll away when finished.;0
83990;My pit mix doesn't seem too enthusiastic with this brand. I'm gonna buy her orijin and hopefully she'll really like it. Good quality dog food;0
78366;I returned this product for the diffuser.  My dog was a bit itchy from the spray on his bandana and I noticed no other difference.  I had selected the spray because I have two dogs and they were going to a pet sitter's house. Since she houses other dogs including her own I could not expect her to plug in a diffuser that some other dog parents might not want. Sadly, this did not work.  Amazon was terrific about the return.;0
20309;I have the yellow duck also and they aren't loud enough.  My pup prefers the yellow squeaky duck that he has.;0
44266;My parrot loved this toy.  I removed the bell but otherwise it  has chews of various types that appealed to her.;0
142867;I gave this 2 stars because my puppy just loved it, right until he chewed threw it. The ball inside is very poor quality, too. He broke that in half in a hearbeat once he got it out. Too bad. I liked the concept so much.;0
100522;A long time Fan of rope toys by Booda Bones, Flossy and a few other makes - we hadn't tried the Hagen yet and are glad we did.Rope toys in general are much safer than other toys, especially if you have an aggressive chewer at home.We have Two Old English Bulldogs Harley, our nine year old 92 pound Chew-Monster and his partner in crime our two year old Elvis. Both just love to chew and play Tug - o - War and this toy at the XL size allows plenty of room for them to go wild. Plus I can get in on the lunacy too - without worrying about losing a few fingers.They're both hardcore, take no prisoners, aggressive chewers. These guys saw through nylabones and Kongs like a beaver buzzing through a 2 X 4. Few toys hold up very long with exception of the good quality rope toys. The rope is quite stiff because the weave is so tight. I know from experience this means the toy should hold up well.Both seem to adore the Mint flavor and the bone shape lends itself to all kinds of interactive play like fetch. Plus the size is manageable allowing our dogs to carry these aroundAfter hours of fierce tug - of war crazy time with me getting in on the fun there's hardly a single strand out of place.Rope Toys Have Lot's of Benefits:* Cleans your dogs teeth and massages the gums* Provides a Great work out (for pooch AND owner)* Doubles as a chew toy and tug toy* Non Toxic - Cotton even with some synthetic floss can't obstruct the intestinal tract like rubber, Polymer and Bone.5 PAWS UP!;0
10039;I can't even comment on how it works because it was broken right out of the box.  I do NOT recommend.  Terrible.  Big Al's at least took it back and refunded me.  so  I give kudos for their customer service.  BUT I wish that I didn't get a crappy product.  I went with Fluval 406 and have not looked back.;0
152119;for me anyway.  I try to mix this in with my other dog foods so I'm still giving some high quality ingredients to my 8 dogs.  This has no fillers, no added sugar, dyes, or artificial preservatives (what it's preserved with, I have no idea) and the first ingredient is chicken.  I'm hoping that the mini chunk formula actually does help clean the teeth as advertised!;0
60848;puppy loves at times, other times not so much. Puppy has developed very dry skin that may be related to use of the product so not quite sure if I will re-purchase;0
11224;Both my cats (who hate to be groomed) and my new medium-coat Pomeranian love this brush. I think it feels like a massage and they willingly lay down or purr when I am brushing them. Minus one star for the fact that I needed to buy more of a combing brush to supplement this product as all of my pets are long-haired and easily tangled. Still a great and VERY handy brush. I plan to use it during my dog's bath time as well.;0
154873;The picture makes you think you are getting more than one. I figured it was just one antler but it should be made clear it is just one.;0
99783;She sniffed it and walked away. However, she is 17 years old and picky. So it may be alright for some cats.;0
10780;Do not toss it in the house...wow does it bounce.  The dog loves this thing.  He is a wild man out in the open field with his Kong!;0
29113;I read reviews and most state this will plug up over time with a snail, algae, or piece of debris.  I will say it is easy to dismantle and clean.  It hasnt plugged on me yet but I practiced taking it apart prior to installing so I'll be ready if/when it happens.  Very simple construction.  It rotates nicely and distributes good flow throughout the tank.  I especially like how it agitates the surface every few seconds.  Really neat to watch.  Mine is powered by a Cobalt MJ900 in a Biocube 14.  Perfect combo, works great!;0
44761;The underside is a bit slippery so it has a tendency to slip and slide on my leather seats.  Am working on a self-made solution to keep the seat part of the cover where it should be.  Fits nicely over the headrests so that is a plus.  Easy to put off and on.  The plastic tubes that are supposed to keep it secure don't do any good, but overall it is doing what it is supposed to, but with a 78 pound Doberman there isn't ANY cover that is going to stay put without additional bungees.;0
46678;We had to have PINK! This was a good price. The color is nice. It would have been nicer if it was a more modern pink like a Hot Pink! But we were just happy to have one in PINK! It arrived with a few scuffs and some random pieces of plastic that should have been trimmed at the manufacturer but its a decent product.;0
94991;Compared to similar treats in similar size these were really a great deal. Our dog LOVES them. I make all her other treats with the exception of these.;0
8443;My dog has never cared much for food.  She's weird like that. The salmon oil definitely makes her more interested in actually eating and I can definitely tell that her skin is better - no more dandruff.;0
153109;First I will say that my cat absolutely loves this stuff and will devour an entire can in a day and look for more.  Second, I will say she usually eats a half to two-thirds of a can, not a full can.  Like most cats, mine is a huge fan of tuna but I also believe this is due to the can being mostly water.  This was a problem I noticed in some of their other flavors.  I'd rather my cat's food was not watered down, I can provide water at a much lower cost.I'm also concerned about the mercury content in tuna, particularly because of reports that recommend you don't consume tuna more than once a week and pregnant females should avoid tuna altogether. While this flavor also contains pork and pork liver, I have no way of comparing the tuna content in this cat food to a regular can of tuna.  Needless to say, if humans can't consume tuna frequently, I'm not comfortable feeding it to my cat except on as an occasional treat.Like another reviewer hinted at, some enterprising pet food producer should start to sell variety packs containing their different flavors.  It would help people determine which flavors their pets like as well as provide an easy way for us to rotate their diets.  You wouldn't want to eat the same food every day, so why should our pets?;0
2194;In all honesty, I'd rather not use this type of chemical product on my dogs.  I resisted for as long as I could but the so-called natural products were, sadly, ineffective.  I was pulling off a tick a day from them and I found a few of the little suckers crawling on me.  That was the last straw, so enter Frontline.  Bottom line, it works better than anything else I've tried. There's nothing more to say about it, except if someone knows about an effective natural/less chemically product, please let me know.;0
110557;I'm always shopping around for litter that works - I prefer clumping, and litter that makes it easier for me since I have three cats. I get a huge box (this came in a plastic bag last time - either way I don't care) and just keep it in a huge plastic tub with a small pan to scoop in what I need. Great price (you really save $$ over the long haul).This is one of the best out there. I wish Amazon would package the shipping a little better so it gets less banged up - you open the box and sometimes there's litter everywhere - but other than that it's fine.;0
35413;As my senior dog gets older it seems her hips aren't as they use to be. These seem to be good.  I assume they are working, I don't hear my doggie complaining.  I normally mix two of these in my senior dog's wet food.  She also has a Cosequin hip pill and soft vitamins too.  The mix seems to work. Wish I could find a larger amount of these for what I would consider a good price.;0
75366;this pet bed was for my cat bootsie, she slept in it once, now my cat jasper took it over he loves it,;0
19649;I love shopping on Amazon! It's so easy and I can avoid the crowded store.  This is a good value.  I have a backyard pond with big fish and they go through a lot of fish food.;0
110305;I have only one small complaint, I think the strap that runs between the neck collar and the under shoulder band shouls be slightly longer. I think it brings the under shoulder strap a little too high under my cat's arm pits and keeps him from being as comfortable as he could be. Other than that I really like the harness. I have a bengal, and while I love him, I do recognize that he's nuts and I knew I needed a really really strong harness. My boy is 16lbs and he's very strong. When he walks he tends to wander and then occassionaly dart at full speed. As you might imagine I was concerned that he would either slip the harness or simply break it. We've been using this for a while now and my little escape artist is not able to get out of it. In fact I think he basically likes it better than a harness he had to step through. I'm very pleased in general - but, I would also add that you might consider getting an extension for the leash.;0
73131;My dog destroyed this very quickly....especially the rope. If you have a rough chewer you will be disappointed with this product.;0
80000;"I had given this a good rating originally but not now.  I bought and used two of these last year for a few months, put them up in the shed for winter and brought them out this year.  Within this last week they both melted.  The first one I luckily noticed and was able to remove from the pond before anything happened and I thought it was a fluke.  Unfortunately, it was not a fluke and the second, within days of the first, caught fire and burned down the pond tent and melted the waterfall basin.With others reporting this same issue this is  not an ""accident"", this seems like a flaw in the heating element or thermostat of the deicer.UPDATE:  I have contacted the manufacturer with great dissatisfaction. They don't want to believe that my units' heating elements were in the water and not exposed to air.  BEWARE:  these units will catch fire when used properly.";0
38963;my cats loved these toys - you can tell when they simply disappear under the couch within 24 hours!! ..;0
123434;Unfortunately, because the cap has a raised center, there's not a lot of drinking space and water will always be &#34,undrinkable&#34, after a few laps from my pup. I can't let her drink from it inside of a store because water will get everywhere and make a slipping hazard out of it.;0
78714;A really good idea and a cute cat toy, but my kitty's have no interest in this .. I heat it up in microwave hoping they will cuddle with it, but they don't.  Is a cute toy though and I would give it 5 stars if my cats would play  with it..;0

44531;I'm a big fan of the AKC toys because they are affordable and realistic.  My dog especially enjoys the movement of the wings when we are playing and is able to squeak this toy, which is a big plus.  She is a 13 lb Lhasa Apso who wakes up and falls asleep playing, silly silly girl, and has a small mouth.  It takes her some work to get some toys to squeak, and we and SHE are very proud when she finally manages to do this....  This being said, I would say this dog toy gets 5 stars.  She did not go crazy over it, but I have been buying her a lot of toys lately and she did enjoy it.  I'll update my review as time passes but overall I'm very pleased with this purchase and think it's one of the better AKC animals to buy if you are shopping around.  Oh and they all SQUEAK, there is no animal like sound... But you know, my dog doesn't seem to care, she likes squeaking!;0
86940;My cat lovesPet Greens Savory Salmon w/ Wheat Grass Cat Treats (3oz). Salmon is one of his favorite flavors. Due to his digestive problems he can't have grain, and these treats are grain free. He always wants more of Pet Greens treats, especially their fish flavors. These treats help his digestion and he likes them better than dried fish and meats.;0
61634;"This fence is a great height for small dogs and pups. However, it is not very adjustable because sizing involves adding/removing sections that are about 6 inches wide, or further expanding out the pressure screws/wall cushions, which can then lead to gaps large enough for the pup/dog to squeeze through. With all the enclosed sections it was too wide for my doorway. However, when I'd remove one of the sections, then it was too small unless I adjusted the pressure screws/wall cushion things out to the point that there was then big enough gaps on both sides so that my pup can squeeze through. (This is very hard to describe, just know that it isn't very flexible for adjusting the width, but there is another one that is much better that does adjust millimeter by millimeter.) To correct this, because we couldn't wait for the good gates (below) to come, I ended up having to duct tape the large openings on the side (see pictures I posted) - what a pain! Now they can't easily be removed if needed. I really wish we'd have pre-planned a bit better and ordered the wood ones in time (we'd used them previously with great success and assumed these would be similar).A much better option is theWalk Over Wooden Gate (30-44"" W, 18"" H)This one is fully adjustable to any size within the given minimum and maximum width, so you can fit your door exactly w/o gaps on the side. Even better, this one is less expensive.So, buy the wooden gate discussed above instead of this one. It is much more adjustable and easier to use.";0
8586;I have been experimenting with different biological filter starters and so far this one is the worst of them. I've been through Jungle Start Zyme (Walmart), Seachem Stability, Tetra Safestart, and Nutrafin Cycle.All of these products seem to have decent Ammonia->Nitrite (Nitrosomonas) bacteria, but only Tetra Safestart and Nutrafin had effective Nitrite->Nitrate (Nitrobacter) bacteria. In fact, I was able to get a pretty solid cycle going on day 3 with Tetra Safestart. Stability had very little effect overall and the bottle is perfectly within its shelf life.Not impressed.;0

84677;Another favorite of my Dane.  She loves chasing these and then runs back squeaking the ball furiously, wanting me to toss it again.  This is our second set because she is a little rough with things (her size plus her aggressiveness in her play).  We like these because our dog loves them, we can toss for a while, and when we are tired of throwing it, she is happy to just squeak it.;0
97800;Our Gray was nearly naked and has been for quite a while.  I had tried changing foods, moving her cage, changing toys, vitamins, and everything I could think of except a collar.  She acts fine, talks, eats well...just like she used to, just no feathers.I added Pluck no More to her water every day for a couple weeks and the plucking slowed, I cut back to every other day and then a couple times a weeks.  Reviews here talked about how bad it could be but I have no plan for long tern use...the next step is a collar if she goes back to plucking.  I also had people telling me that homeopathic remedies don't work...well that seems not to be the case.She hates to be sprayed so I didn't do that, but she does take her baths in her water bowl so she did get some on her skin.I am very happy with the results I have seen so far.  She doesn't look ready for the stew pot any more.;0
41680;We keep this on the dog leash now. It makes it easy to clean up after any messes and keeps the bags neatly contained without having to fumble in my pocket. It's very lightweight and functional.;0
112437;I usually buy these for my foster dogs from the South as when they come to live with me, the Vermont temperatures and weather is much colder than that which they are accustomed. The coat is cozy as it is flannel lined. I would suggest if you have a heavy or pudgy dog that you order a larger size.  The dogs do not seem to mind wearing them and they are easy to put on due to the Velcro closures. I was pleased with the purchase, product, and quality.;0
141057;I puchased this at a local pet store, and they no longer carry this stick.  Our dogs LOVE this stick, and gnaw it down to a nub.  Would much rather have them shewing on this than actual sticks from the yard.  Very well made product.;0
152064;Bought two of these for our two lab mixes. They're good looking tags, nice bold colors and clear legible font. The laser etching may look like printing but it's very durable and won't scratch.These look nicer than a similar set we got at the DIY kiosk at the pet store.;0
149710;These small treats are perfect for my 14-1/2 year old Siberian Husky.  The only thing is that she wants more and more of them.  Now, when we go for her daily walk I put a few in my coat pocket and it is amazing how much better she walks when I give her one of these peanut butter flavored bones.  She gets so happy that she bounces when she walks.  I will keep buying these as long as I can get them.;0
43517;Product really works. Recommended by vet for those cats who are susceptible to herpes/calici virus. Easy to administer. Granules adhere to dry food. Undetected by cats. Wonderful preventative/supplement. I apply daily to both dry and wet food. Noticeable improvement, haven't seen an outbreak in over a year.;0
125776;I have a very picky cat, who won't eat any food! I tried many cat food brands until I tried this, she loves it! I even bribe her with it to leave birds alone :);0
31047;I accidentally bought the wrong size training slip leash for my 5 lb. yorkiepoo. However, I kept it for my parents Springer Spaniel, and it's perfect for larger breeds. My mistake became their benefit because that spaniel will drag anyone on a regular leash, and this slip lead helps train her how to walk properly without pulling.;0
67682;I absolutely love these treats and so do my dogs. I have one on daily medication. I used to try and hide the pills in hot dogs or cheese. He got good at eating everything but the medicine. With these, he doesn't have a choice and yet loves them. Highly recommend these treats.;0
48758;what can you say about pill pockets.  the pill pockets arived quickley and it was a good price.  My cat needs them;0
151286;I have used Feliway for years and find if I discontinue it (I get the cheaps) I will see the result in my cats' attitude.  Since using it my life with my guys has been extremely better.  I use at least 4 diffusers in the house at all times.;0
25339;My pooch loves this stuff. We live overseas and it takes our mail about 3 weeks - this does not have to be refrigerated until it is opened. We normally shred it and mis it in his food daily but you can also cut it up and give it as a treat.;0
8430;The dog certainly didn't say those exact words but her actions certainly indicate her satisfaction with the Grizzly Salmon Oil.  I like the ease of distribution - three squirts every morning in the kibble mixture and she evidently likes the taste.  It is kept stored in the refrigerator's top shelf within easy grasp for the daily dose.  Her coat has always been pretty decent and continues to be easily manageable.  Does the product contribute to that?  I can't say for sure but it certainly doesn't appear to do any harm.  I've just placed another order - three squirts a day goes a long way but does eventually need re-stocking.  If it makes any difference, the dog is a female Golden Retriever, aged 18 months, weighing in at a healthy 60 lbs.;0
20179;I bought this bed to put on my desk so my kitties would sit on it rather than on whatever I am presently reading. It works perfectly! It is non-skid, has never slid off the desk. It is also very attractive. The cats like it. I like it. :);0
26234;"Did not purchase from Amazon but from Petco and paid ~ $16.00.What caught my attention was not having to worry about the other combs we have that have round plastic tips at the end of wire combs that can become detached.  Also figured that it would have the benefit of brushing furniture and clothing to remove fur due to the electrostatic charge.Well I started using it and it seems that the majority of the cats seem to prefer this comb.  It seems like it provides a slight drag on the coat and gives them that ""stroking"" / massage feel.  Also the amount of fur seems to be a bit more than what we got with the wired comb, we believe the electrostatic charge keeps the fur on the comb versus falling on floor.I don't believe it was my imagination but after combing the fur seems to just looked groomed / combed look...hard to explains but it looks nice.In my opinion, this comb seems like it would work well for shorthaired cats (all our cats are shorthaired). The longer fine tooth combs may be better for long haired cats since this may pull too much for long haired cats.Haven't tried it on clothes yet, but that's secondary to the cats liking this comb!";0
39725;We had an older cat recently adopted from the shelter and we soon learned she had intestinal cancer. Because of her illness she was inconsistent with using the litter box and vomited almost 2-3 times a day. The dumb cat immediately got rid of the urine and vomit smells and stains (they were treated immediately).Something noted was that she wouldn't urinate or defecate in any of the spots previously treated with the dumb cat. She literally moved 10-12 inches down the hall the next time. So I soon just randomly sprayed the entire hallway and eventually got her trained to go back in the box consistently until she lost control of her body. So I can say this worked in help train our cat until physically impossible for her and it also successfully cleaned up the messes if they occurred.;0
70688;need a backup for our fish.  great price and product  better air supply for the fish and helps the tank;0
142814;No complaints at all. It works exactly how you'd want. It was much sturdier than I expected. I'd always imagined these collapsible bowls to be flimsy but the materials in this are top notch.;0
34654;My boxer dog is gonna love this toy for christmas.  I let them &#34,preview&#34, their gifts before christmas to get them excited and Reese loved it.  He is a 2 yr old boxer and loves to play with toys.  It looks pretty durable and they give you 3 extra eggsto replace? the other eggs when they wear out?;0
154101;I carefully observed my dogs for 3 consecutive days on these stress management pills.  I didn't notice anything different.  To make these tablets effective, I suggest doing something more than merely observation as I did.  For example, one could try dog training lessons at the same time.;0
55626;I became a Pet Guardian to an older dog obtained from Animal Welfare.  Her teeth were full of tartar.  This product was recommended to me by my friend at ridgwoodpoodles.com who grooms, breeds and owns show dogs and has champions in Brazil and the U.S.  She told me before I spent a heafty amount of money for a dental cleaning at the vet to try this and see how I liked it.  Since she's the expert I purchased this product.  It was very easy to use.  You just put a small amount of this product on your finger - rub it on the dogs teath every day - or whenever you think about it and the results are phenominal.  My friend at ridgewoodpoodles.com is a genius.  I was astonished at how great the results were and so was my vet!  I would absolutely recommend this item.;0
33414;I've been using slightly more expensive ones (lately, Arm & Hammer and Ever Clean, both with odor control), and decided give this cheaper option a try, and looks like I'm here to stay.ODOR CONTROL: Weirdly enough, this product is certainly not smellier than the aforementioned ones (even though it does not boast odor control), If anything I have less of an odor problem now.CLUMPING: As other reviewers, said, the urine clumps tend to stick to the bottom and form giant clumps (more like a clay layer), but you can break those in 3-5 seconds into smaller clumps and put them away, Honestly, I don't see how this ended up being a big deal for some.DUST-CONTROL: Yes, this is probably a primary reason why I I'm intending to stick with this litter, this is the least dust-producing litter I've used.PACKAGING: I prefer this products packaging to others too, especially to the flimsy cardboard covers. It is very thick plastic that does not arrive damaged, and you can cut a small hole to easily pour controlled amounts each time.;0
52164;Works great for the car for my 50 pound dog.  Folds up to take with us.  He is older and needed this set of steps to continue rides in the car.;0
144590;Expensive, but our very picky dog just loves this stuff.  The only problem with it is that other dogs that play in our yard find out about it and try to sneak their way into our kitchen to get to it.  We went out of town for a few weeks and lost an entire bag and a half to other people's dogs as our dog-watcher was feeding our dog outside where the others could find it.  In any case, good stuff.;0
155407;I've found mulitple stains using this. As soon as I got it I put the batteries in, closed all the blinds, and started hunting for hidden stains. It's amazing what happens when those stains are actually cleaned properly.  The house smells better already!  I'll probably get this as a gift each time a friend gets a new puppy.  Great product!!;0
47063;Just bought another of these as they're simply a joy for cats to live in.  Because of the 3 tiers, cats have something to do and readily interact in this environment.  I've used them as a cat home as well as a necessity for placement situations where the cats have to be calm and interactive.  The Midwest offering is not only sturdy, but foldable and easy to maintain.  Plusses all the way around.;0
38224;We use this bed outside on our patio.  I got it in hopes one of my dogs would stop lying in the flower/dirt bed and on this instead but no such luck yet.  My other bichon does lay on it all of the time though.. he is more the type to sit on the back door mat or the concrete.  I have been finding him on this bed every time i go outside to let them in.  Its durable enough, easy to put together, and seems like it will hold up well.  i wish they had one my size!  I like the fact that it has a 3 year warranty on the cover and replacements at a minimal cost.;0
42860;This product is good. It is a hydrocortisone so good for itching etc..smell is okay.  only thing is bottle is quite small, but not a big issue.  Good to have on hand for dogs with allergies.;0
30075;It is hard to control its movement, and where/how to store it when it is not in use is problematical;0
64450;I got this leash for it's lightness for my 4 pound puppy and it does the job well. Just the right length. He is still chewing on it alot and it has not frayed a bit so it's pretty durable too. It's a little stiff from the newness of it, but I hope it will soften a bit with lots of use.;0
105045;I have a shitzu yorkie mix and he completely ignores this or doesn't hear it, I have tried using it for the ridiculous barking he does at imagined sounds, or when one of my kids enters my bedroom, and you would swear he never knew my kids for the past 4 years...I was going to throw mine in the  trash, but maybe I will try it again since a lot of reviewers say it works well for them. when my dog barks because the next door neighbors dogs are up at 6 am barking, I find the best thing for me to do is close the .window and instant quietness.;0
19894;Bought this to supplement our dry food for our german shepherd and shih tzu.  It smells pretty bad, but that's tripe for you and the dogs love it.  Once we open the can the dogs go nuts over it.  The cans come in an easy peel lid which saves on time of using a can opener.  We keep it in a plastic sandwich sized zip lock bag in the fridge and it does a good job keeping the smell in.  Dogs love it.  No doubt.;0
37974;This is a great expansion for any cage!  It does not come with instructions but if you look at one of the pieces it has extra plastic rings in the middle of it, put this in the hole you are adding the expansion on too, take the J shaped piece and from inside the cage with a O ring on it, snap them together (WARNING) it will be hard to get them back apart without taking the top of the cage off and alittle work.  But the top of the lookout comes off and allows you to have even easier access to play with your pet.  As bad as a pun as it is, I really wanted to say play with your little critters, LOL.  Oh and if you try to put it on the side of the cage, OFCOURSE you are going to have issues with keeping it upright.  it does not really attach that way, it is mean to the top, or for adding into a more stable section of a expansion.;0
122871;For many years, I was a staunch believer in Everclean cat litter, which is pricier than the Arm & Hammer brand.  Trying to save some money, I tried this A&H Super Scoop brand, and it's wonderful.  The litter box is so much easier (and not as unpleasant) to clean since the Super Scoop really hardens up like a rock, never sticking to the bottom of the litter box and no clumps falling apart in mid-scoop.  The unscented version is terrific for those who suffer from perfume allergies.  I ordered a monthly subscription, since it's much easier to simply carry the 40-lb box from my front porch to the bathroom, rather than lugging the heavy box through the store, out to my car, and then into the house to the bathroom.  A win-win-win situation!;0
61900;This is a great alternative to plastic e-collars, but I wouldn't use this for weeks as the only e-collar for my pet. This is a good solution for dogs recovering post-op, or for pets with skin problems like hot spots or licking granulomas. But you should provide a second, lighter e-collar option occasionally when you will be present to watch your pet.Pros:* Sturdy, good quality, stands up to heavy use* Strong enough to resist bending of edges, more rigid than flexible nylon-fabric e-collars* Long enough to prevent licking of wounds (follow manufacturer's measuring guide)* Collar loops allow it to be attached to pet's own collar, prevents removal* Washable fabric stands up to cleaning, food and water* Fast removal, adjustment using Velcro strip* Manufacturer provides protective Velcro cover strip to keep exposed Velcro clean* Reflective strip edging is night-time safety feature (though consider removing for walks)* Length adjustable, can be folded back for eating/drinking when owner presentCons:* May be longer (deeper in small-to-medium sizes) than desirable for smaller dogs, measure carefully** Slightly heavier than other e-collar materials, may be fine on larger dogs, but monitor smaller dogs' use* Narrower cone angle than normal e-collars, restricts side airflow if worn long-term (see reviews re ear problems)* Solid fabric can limit pet's vision, so consider removing for brief walks or substitute a clear collar* Less adjustable in outer width than cloth or plastic e-collars since Velcro determines closure* Length may make drinking more difficult when leaving pet alone, but can be folded back for eating/drinking when owner presentIn summary, the Comfy Cone e-collar is a comfortable alternative if your pet is an aggressive chewer or licker of wounds, hot spots and needs longer protection. Just be prepared to give your pet breaks from wearing it (monitored during walks outside?) or have a second lighter fabric or plastic collar on-hand for those times (like the VetOne e-collars, as backups). Long-eared dogs might need breaks from wearing it long-term to prevent ear infections (as noted in other reviews) since its shape is long and narrow. But it resists the abuse a strong-willed dog can give to more lightweight e-collars, and should be usable for years, if cared for. See the customer photos here of different pets using this collar to help you decide if it will work on your cat or dog.*Note: the manufacturer's measuring guide says to measure your pet from neck to tip of nose to decide which size will work best, ideally, it should be longer than nose length to protect the pet's wound.SIZE CHART in inches: Small 12.5 cm =  4.9 inches, Medium 20 cm= 7.8 inches, Large 25 cm = 9.8 inches, Extra Large 30 cm = 11.8 inches (refers to depth of cone)Example of a second clear e-collar for back-up use with Comfy Cone:Cardinal Laboratories E-Collar, LargeCardinal Laboratories Pet Botanics E-Collar, XXL, Clear;0

63502;"We have 9 rescued cats here at work.. needless to say we go through cat food ( along with other supplies) a lot!We use Fancy Feast for special needs cats.. cats that are getting medicine, (we mix he medicine in with it) cats that are new and awaiting veterinary care ( to get tested, spayed/neutered) and for our older picky eaters.While Fancy Feast will never be the least expensive option, it is a very good quality food, we use both the ""classic"" (Pate) and this style. This particular blend does NOT have a ""cat food"" smell to it, it actually smells like grilled food - real food - not pet food!All I know is when I open this can up ALL the cat's ears perk up and come running.. it is a winner.. no matter what flavor in the mix you try ( although they seem particular to the turkey)Since we have so many cats, Fancy Feast in general is not a cost effective food to use for all of them daily, but if you have one or two cats, they will go nuts for this!****Jim";0
23356;"This is on the intermediate size.I have 2 of the dogs pictured. They are no where close to the 15 - 20 lbs this item is to be able to fit and carry.They will fit in there but not comfortable enough that I would want to leave them in there long. I consider a goodfit when they can stand up and turn around without knocking all the food and water out of their bowl. Can't bedone here. The bowl they give you is pretty much worthless unless you have a pet gerbel.I wasn't an A student in math but I don't get the dimensions they advertize to add up. I got up to 4"" less on lenght.The width appeared accurite at 16.7 "". I got 13 "" at best on heighth rather than 14.5. Granted the differences aren'tgreat but when you are on the edge of fitting or not fitting every inch counts. Luckily the 4"" on lenght doesn't effectmy dogs but it would many 15 - 20 lb. dogs.The storage compartments are pretty much useless even for miniature dogs or cats. They would hold some trainingtreats ( out of the bag ) but that is about it. They are so small it took me awhile to figure out they were the "" storage compartments "".For the price paid it is a well made crate. I will use them to carry my dogs back and forth to the vet and on vacationbut that is about it. I would never put one of my dogs on an airplane in one of these crates though !I use them mainly in the house and they would be great if they were as big as indicated. I can stilluse them though. They are close enough not to send back. If I had it to do over I would have bought a large for my malethat weighs all of 10 lbs. soaking wet. My female is getting use to it but she was not a happy camper. She wanted moreroom also. She has her ritual of getting her blanket just right to lay on and that is harder for her to do than she prefers. :)It is a sad state of affairs when you need a large carrier for 10 & 11 lb. dogs. I guess they get claustrophobia too ! Or mine anyway.";0
133114;This is a great little dog harness. The clasp is somewhat small, but I have big hands and still had no issues with it. I also didn't have major issues adjusting it though I did have to fumble with the small adjusters a little bit and that is the only reason I took 1 star off.Aside from that, it looks nice and is easy to see, which is a bonus when you have a small dog. Definitely would purchase again if I ever lost this one.;0
124546;We have all different styles and materials of scratchers for our two cats who are both 2 years old. I recently bought them another cardboard scratcher and they loved it. I saw the PetFusion on moderncat  and thought I would try it. Both cats loved it right out of the box. They have so much fun running thru the middle. We play games with it with their wand toys. They make up their own games.  They love sitting up on top like it is their throne. I think they got their moneys worth in just the first couple of days.  The best thing as they love to scratch on it.;0
67444;My dog really loves the Stella and Chewy's freeze dried dog food. She ate her previous food a little at a time, all day long. I can give her a patty and it is gone in a matter of minutes, sometimes seconds.  Before I was worried she wasn't eating enough and now I am much more relieved knowing she is getting plenty to eat each day.;0
13458;I had bought this along with a scratch mat from target to put catnip inside.  The catnip that came with the target mat drove my cat crazy!  She absolutely loved it.  However, when that wore off I tried this cosmo catnip and... absolutely nothing.  Obviously some catnip works for my cat, so I don't get why this stuff had no effect at all.  I'm not sure if it is my cat, but now I have a whole tub of this stuff and she is completely unimpressed.  It might be worth a shot for others though.;0
35238;I once had this toy some months ago, but my dog lost it in the backyard. I really like this because the dogs can play their favorite game (tug of war) and it squeaks. Although each time the puppies have ripped off the green felt on the outside and the purple lining on the side, the toy still holds up to abusive play.;0
42932;have tried several kinds, like all of them even though they don't last very long.;0
148667;NO INTERESTED IN THIS PINK PIGGY AT ALL. THE DOG WILL RUN TOWARDS ME WHEN HE HEARS THE SOUND, BUT HE WOULD NOT EVEN TOUCH THIS TOY FOR SOME REASON. A WASTE OF MONEY. NOW IT JUST STAY UNDER THE BED.;0
68380;I put this on my puppy and she loves it doesn't mind it at all gotta say it's awesome and I will be buying more products made by Zack and Zoey;0
3205;My pup goes with me most everywhere and I wear sunglasses to protect my eyes, so I wanted the same for him.  Doggles fit him perfectly.  I measured him twice before ordering to make sure the fit would be correct.  The lenses are orange and brighten everything up while deflecting UV rays.  They weren't bought with a cute factor as the main objective however they are cute.  Super cute. Everyone who has seen him wearing them loves them. To get him used to wearing them I put the doggles on him several times a day, a few minutes at a time, for about a week.  He still tries to take them off every once in a while but he is adjusting to them.  For the most part they stay on him as long as he isn't trying to take them off.  Very happy with doggles.;0
113469;Leaves my dogs soft and shiny...the smell isn't very strong, but in a good way. They've felt clean for days since bathing them with this stuff...so far I have no reason to look for any other shampoo for my pups.;0
137928;We ordered this collar because we were having trouble finding a quality leather collar that fits our lab/pit mix's 16.5 in neck. She had already broke one of her cheaper collars because she pulls so much when other dogs are close, so we were willing to spend a little extra for a high-quality one. We were very pleasantly surprised with the quality for this price! It is nicely padded, the buckle is sturdy, and the leather is flexible to avoid the creasing we saw with other leather collars. If I am being nitpicky, it is a little difficult to hook the leash one because of how close the loop is to the buckle, but it wouldn't stop us from ordering another one (though I doubt we would need to!).;0
72233;Kong catnip is the best catnip I have used!  It is strong, it keeps it's intense scent and the cats love it.  I bought a large jar to make cat toys with and I had all my cats on the table fighting over the jar!  I highly recommend Kong catnip.;0
51528;I have a 1 year old puggle.  He loves playing ball and this ball he can not figure out how to rip it apart.;0
64900;My new kitty loves these and the size is great until he gets bigger. But expect to use these for quite a while because he really loves the flavor and texture. At least that is what he tells me.;0
102132;There are some very well-written reviews that explain the set-up and use of the toy, so I'm not going to try to duplicate that. I'll just tell you how it was received in our home.We have three dogs: A four-year old German Shepherd mix, a eight-year old Siberian Husky, and a year old Australian Kelpie. They all have differing needs in terms of indoor entertainment. But all three find the Wobbler entertaining.Our German Shepherd mix was afraid of it at first. When he started using it, he hit himself in the head with it, and it can pack quite a punch (literally and figuratively) due to its weight. But the lure of treats kept him coming back, and he now knows how to use it without getting hit in the head. He neatly smacks it around in a gentle manner until it's empty.Our Kelpie beats it with reckless abandon, knocking cats over in his travels. We actually had to suspend using it during the holidays because he's almost knocked over the Christmas tree repeatedly while he's beating it up.Our husky will only use it in private, so we suspect he hires someone to come in and empty it for him.The greatest part about the Wobbler (Large) is that the hole allows for different-sized treats, so nothing needs to be uniformly-sized for it to come out. We can even put bits of chicken jerky in it, which is a great high value treat to get the dogs coming back for more.It's a great toy for dogs to work with. Just make sure you don't have anything valuable on the floor (or can fall onto the floor)!;0
133265;I already have a in-tank breeders box but I decided to check this one out because my current one is a bit small and only has passive water flow through. I also I thought I can use this one for an overflow by drilling a hole in the bottom of the box.First of all, it's a very nicely made item. It has a lot of parts, is well thought out and well built, it's not a cheaply made item by any means. You hang this on the back or side. You will need an air pump for water circulation. And once you've put it together and attach the air hose it's as simple as that, nothing else needed. There are two separators so you can make it into a 2 or 3 compartment breeder. There is also a hole on top for feeding.Other uses: After I got it I realized that I cannot use it for an overflow tank because the intake hose is too small and this type of acrylic is not the best for drilling holes in because it's pretty brittle. However, this will make a great wet/dry filter. The box is pretty big and you can fill it with bioballs or biomax, slip a pre-filter sponge over the inlet and you've got mechanical and bio-filtration! This would be a great wet/dry filter for a 30g tank or less.Anyhoo, it's a great breeder box and wet/dry filter, I highly recommend it.;0
39423;I have ordered this item many times from various dealers. This was by far the quickest I ever received the delivery. As for the product, It is as good or better than other brands such as Sonovi. My dog has been taking them for 6 years. He is almost 10 yo and 116#. He still plays like he's a puppy with pretty good mobility.;0
119509;We really liked the 12 &#34, that is discontinued, our little girl pug had the squeaker out of this in less than an hour but continues playing with her &#34,blue doggie&#34,. We tried the 18 inch but she doesn't much care for it...bring bag the mid sized 12 inch Loofa Ruff!;0
48007;My cat loved it and when she got used to the scratcher she liked digging her paws in it. She also liked the infinity ball.;0
104145;I love this heater! always good to use and has no problem with anything.it's black and fully submersible. Also, when you do water change, that's really have to move away not like others because its' glass heater.;0
119087;I had an older version of the sport dog brand. This one holds charge must better and the connections for the charger work much better. I wish it had the audible beeb rather than the vibration but it works great and I have had no issues like I did with the sport dog brand.;0
140454;"""More common in mid- to smaller-sized dogs, but occasionally seen in larger dogs or cats. Scooting is also common in overweight pets and those with loose stools. Animals that are overweight have less muscle tone and sometimes additional fat tissue in the way of proper emptying of the sacs""Now I feel really bad that over feeding our 14 year old miniature fox terrier has led her to need to scoot on the carpet.The scooting started a year ago, probably a combination of age, over eating and her small (should be under 10 pounds - but she weighs in a 12 pounds) stature.So we take her to the vet to express the glands.We spotted this product a couple months ago and now use it as a treat.She has twice daily bowel movements but they are a variety of colors, shapes and sizes - lol.We will keep her on these for a a year and hope the combination of expressing and these chews will make her senior years a little smoother - so far so good - instead of monthly we have been going every 3 months.She loves the duck-flavor and she has had no gastrointestinal tract issues with the blend (larch tree extract, maltodextrin, pumpkin powder, brewers yeast, canola oil, citric acid, glycerin, mixed tocopherols, duck flavor, oat flour, oat meal, propionic acid, rosemary extract, rye flour, silicon dioxide, sorbic acid, soy lecithin, vegetable oil.)She has half a chew each day";0
128463;We have a young Jack Russel and one thing we learned quickly was stuffing and squeekies were not only a waste of time, but dangerous.  This toy has lasted longer than any we have bought her and is still a working toy,  good for fetch and tug of war.  Can't thank the people who recommended this for our JRT enough.;0
126325;There are a lot of similar play pens out there, but most have a bottom that attaches with scattered pieces of Velcro. I knew that wouldn't work for my rambunctious min-pin and curious ferret. This play pen has not only a zippered mesh top, but a ZIPPERED BOTTOM as well! They can't get out! It's spacious, easy to open and close, and super lightweight. The bag comes in handy too.;0
153163;Dog loves these, especially when we hid the squirrels in the acorn.  Being able to replace &#34,dead&#34, squirrels is also great.  Probably too small for very large dogs but small - medium will enjoy.;0
50118;I thought this was a great toy, but my shepherd mix (supposedly very smart according to several different trainers we've worked with) never really got into it.He likes tug toys, but this is not a great tug toy because the dog will grab the rope end, and you'll grab the plastic jug end. If your dog is any good at playing tug at all, you will lose every time.He did not seem to enjoy chewing the purple spiky part either.There was some interest in getting the treats out, but it never lasted very long. The treats have to be fairly small to come out. I spent nearly an hour cutting up treats to make them easy to get out, and that helped perk his interest a little, but he always went back to other toys.Maybe its too complex for him. He does LOVE another puzzle toy we have. Its like a buster cube, but its a tough rubber ball (melon sized) with a maze like center. You put treats in one side by pushing them through a crossed slit, and after some rolling they fall out a hole on the other side. He loves that toy. I think its cool, too, but I fear what might be growing inside it, and the only way I've figured out to clean it is to soak it in vinegar and then put it in the dishwasher and hope.This toy is at least easy to clean.I ended up giving it to a neighbor to see if her dog might like it better.;0
70084;My little dogs love the Smokehouse Duck Tenders and they are a good weight conscious treat for them!  I'm glad Amazon usually has them in stock.  they are worth the price!;0
147548;These are nice and long and made plant maintenance so much easier.  I haven't see any reason to believe these will rust.  I'm not a rustologist but the material doesn't seem to be the kind that would rust.  I like them and glad I got them.;0
8038;It is a good dewormer because it treats 4 different types of worms: round. flat, ring and whip. The whip are one of the more difficult to deal with. I recommend this product.;0
10566;If you have a strong chewer, you already know this is the best and virtually only toy that will survive.;0
5729;I change about 10% of my water on a weekly bases. I have not had any problem with losing fish.;0
98200;I also originally got one of these from Walmart and then they quit carrying them and was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  To say our Catahoula is an aggressive chewer is an understatement.  She destroys every toy she gets, usually in under an hour or two.  The first pig we got lasted a good 3 months before she chewed through the leg and while it no longer grunts, it rattles.  She was thrilled when she got a new &#34,grunter&#34, and at the same time, still loves the one that rattles.  It stands up to alot of constant chewing with no parts coming off.  I would give it a 5 star if it could last her 6 months =)  Will definitely try to keep one of these in the house at all times.;0
68743;I thought this was ground pine, my fault.  My 2 cats hate this.  One of them is going outside the box so she doesn't have to touch it.  I wish I could send it back.  A waste of money.;0
116257;The item is useful, however the net dettached from the rod after only a month of use.  The parts seem to be glued and really brittle.  The quality is cheap.;0
129429;The product is as advertised but the trouble is my cats won't go near it for scratching as they seem to prefer sisal.;0
132001;I really like this particular massaging shampoo brush.  I was searching for a good one and ordered this one because of the ability to grip the brush between my fingers, which keeps the brush from slipping out of my hand.  I will use this brush to distribute a dry shampoo through my dog's coat when I want to freshen him up between visits to the groomer.;0
75118;I figured this wasn't going to work all that well, but turns out works great. It's not the best quality of plastic, but it does the job. Was kind of impressed.;0
51313;This is my fourth order of Nutramax Dasuquin with MSM.  Our Border Collie, Holly, has had joint problems for several years and was to the point of not being able to get up from a lying position which made us very worried.  I gave these a try after reading the reviews and after a month could see such a difference.  She's been on them for a year and a half and is still doing great.  The harsh winter temperatures here made no difference to her except she wasn't willing to go out as often. She is such a picky eater that I have to hide the tablet in her evening meal but she eats it without spitting it out (which she will do to peas and corn). They ARE expensive but the alternative was to have no Holly.  So yes, I would recommend this product to anyone with a crippled up animal.;0
89187;These are probably The most durable dog toys I have.  My pit bull mix goes through toys that are guaranteed to last (yes, I got my money back) in one day.  She has yet to get through these.  They still whistle too, even after all of her chewing (she chews on them like a piece of gum).The dogs quickly learned to follow the whistle noise when I throw them until the ball comes back down into their field of vision.  If I pretend to throw it and there's no whistle, they whip around because they know I didn't throw it.;0
117585;This is just the right thing to use to convert our regular harnesses into car seats. I have one in the front and one in the back. Doesn't interfere with people using the seat, just push it aside.;0
25400;They played with it for about 5 minutes  the first day and have not touched it since. I  try to get them to come over to and they just walk away.;0
150135;Can't beat 700 bags and a bag holder for this cheap. I will be purchasing more when the time comes. I typically double-bag when I clean up after my dog, simply because 1 bag does not usually mask the smell in the trash can.;0
85466;I thought this would be a great water bottle for our newly purchased guinea pig. I liked the top fill feature and the secure attachment to the cage (which are really good features). However, it dribbled and leaked a ton. So I returned it and got aLiving World Eco + Water Bottle, 26-Ounceand haven't had great luck with that either. This also has to be held until installed once you fill it. The bottom is not flat so if you lay it down, it leaks out of the top.I finally purchased a bottle that does not leak: Lixit Quick Fill Flip-top Water Bottle.Pros on this bottle: attaches securely, fills from the top.Cons: leaks.;0
129935;It says it has four squeakers, but it has to have more!  My dog can get the squeaker out of any toy and destroy it.  This is the best toy I have ever bought for him.  He doesn't give up either, so there is squeaking non-stop and it is just the funniest thing.  Talk about entertaining for both of us. My dog has a really tough mouth and he weighs 13 lbs.  I bet a bigger dog will have a great run at it too.  Thank you so much;0
19173;So extremely easy to use, and easy to clean.  You just turn it on its side, then back to the floor, then dump the bucket.  Only recommendation I have though is to use a good clumping litter.  The cheapo store brands break apart instead of clump, so it breaks apart on the grate.  It becomes nasty because you're just mixing around crumbled up pee litter.  Spend a few extra bucks on higher quality clumping litter and it works great.;0
25332;My dogs really like this stuff.  But it's really not the healthiest.  I use at as a treat every once in a while.;0
130779;My 2 year old Lab loved all the squeakers in the feet, tore ever limb off, tore all the stuffing out, and shredded the entire cow apart. I expected as such, so other than having to pay for it, I had to give it 4 stars. It lasted 1 month.;0
97384;My cat had been scratching herself constantly.  She doesn't have fleas or mites, just constant scratching.  Then I thought she might have allergies to her food.  I tried this product and have seen a dramatic reduction in the scratching and her course greasy looking coat is now so soft and fluffy.  It's only been three weeks but I can see a lot of difference.  It's a little pricey but the benefits to my cat are worth it.;0
46815;Good product with a good price and works well. Would buy again.;0
142710;I love the crackle ball, and my mini dachshund does, too. He loves the crackle and I love that he's having fun. He has a couple of these. They are durable and keeps him entertained for quite awhile.;0
87244;It took a second to get the automatic setting to work (give it a tap!) but this toy is AMAZING. I cannot wait to bring it outside during the spring at night! My cats (1 year, 2 7-month-olds) were actually tired out by it. It's so much fun, easy to use, and made them really, really happy. And I don't have to worry about me getting tired out before they do! Highly recommend this for houses with cats (or dogs)!;0
32755;My dog seems to like this bed, not only for the coolness but also for the softness.  feels like a memory foam mattress.  I put a sheet over it for easy washing.;0
19073;Did not work as well as I thought it would. Maybe I just need some practice.;0
88282;This is a nice size container and very easy to open/close.  Gives a nice tight seal to maintain freshness.  I purchased with the KONG hedgehog cat nip toy and my cats LOVE it.  Pleased with the purchase;0
42925;I didn't wanted to buy anything that was made with rawhide but a friend gave my pup a Dingo and he loved it. So I forced myself and brought my first bag of Dingo Dental Bones a month ago. Stitch loved it! I loved it too because he actually spent a good 45 minutes~2 hours on a Dingo Dental Bone. I didn't really like the red dye in the chicken meat but it wasn't overwhelming. If you actually crack a piece of the chicken off you can still see some non-dyed chicken.So I ordered a second bag of Dingo, just the original red package. The red dye was so strong that the whole piece of chicken was blood red and it even DYED the rawhide pinkish red!! It's kind of ridiculous to dye something the dog can smell! It's not necessary as long it tastes delicious.Anyhow I am on the search for something else, hopefully a better alternative other than Dingos.At least it wasn't made in China.;0
142161;A great training and encouragement tool. I try to always have some in my pocket. All it takes is for my hand to move toward my pocket and the dog wants to know what I want it to do.;0
19538;I have a 5 month old Maltese and she loves it.  She can grab it and toss it and it keeps her busy plus she gets exercise.;0
152762;"Why Bake-a-Bone?  Why not?  I've got one dog who is a ""special needs"" dog and I definitely like to control the ingredients in his food as much as possible.  He fares much better without a lot of odd ingredients and preservatives.  I'm much more comfortable with the fact that I do have some control and there's nothing in these ""cookies"" that I couldn't or wouldn't eat myself.  I opted for peanut butter (recipe below) because both my dogs are wild about the flavor.  I've purchased Paul Newman's organic peanut butter treats, but in time I'm sure I'll come out ahead by making my own.  I've listed some ready-made packets you can purchase below and also have listed the recipes in the booklet at the bottom of this review.Bake-A-Bone Mixes:Bake-A-Bone Peanut Butter and  Banana BlastBake-A-Bone Triple Peanut ButterUndoubtedly, this ""cookie"" baking experience was one of the most fun experiences this family has seen in some time.  My two dogs knew something was up when I got out the Bake a Bone, the ingredients, and a mixing bowl.  My dogs instinctively know when they will be included and Brandy, who would be Holly Housewife if she were human, was especially excited.  While they danced around underfoot, I decided to make up the recipe for ""Peanut Butter Dog Treats.""  Both Brandy and Liam adore peanut butter and knew they would be getting something out of this mess.I've tried making dog cookies by using a cookie cutter and baking them, but I've never been particularly satisfied with the results.  I got everything from ever-so-slightly overdone (burnt) to overly soft.  These cookies were perfect!  The recipe I chose to use was very easy to mix and, unlike a similar recipe for peanut butter balls, was much faster.  One real plus is that I can use organic ingredients, which I did with the exception of the baking powder.  Within a couple of minutes I was good to go.  When I looked at those four little slots I knew I'd be making a mess.  I was pleasantly surprised when the cookie dough seemed to slide right in.I was waiting for a green colored light to come on, but it was actually an orange color.  There are two lights, one on the left and right of the unit.  The outer casing of the one on the right is green in color, but when the unit is ready, it is orange.  It took ten minutes to make four large cookies, but the whole process was lots of fun.  I couldn't find my cooling rack so simply placed them on my dish drainer, a perfect solution. Cleanup, considering I made a mess, was actually relatively quick all things considered.  I put the whole unit back in the box it came in to protect it.  Brandy and Liam had a great time and loved the event.  I'm sure they'll remember it when we decide to bake again.SAMPLE RECIPEPeanut Butter Dog Treats~  2 cups whole-wheat flour~  1 tbsp baking power~  1 cup peanut butter (chunky or smooth)~  1 1/2 cups milkPlug in Bake-a-Bone, when the green light comes on, it's ready to bake!

51430;The seller was great and very quick shipping. This harness is very easy to attach. It is padded so it is also very comfortable for your dog. It snaps right in place using your current seat belt in your car/truck/mini van/suv. It also snaps around the dog with no problems and can be adjusted to fit. The dog doesn't even seem to mind it or even know it's their. I got the Large for my German Shepherd. I put it on, snap her in the mini van and off we go. She can lay down or sit up, turn a little from side to side but it keeps her in place so I don't have to worry about her in case of an accident. It is simply wonderful. My vet saw it and gave it two thumbs up.  Highly recommended.;0
25616;I have two Siamese cats, and I really like this food.  It does help with hairballs, and I like the larger size kibble that forces them to eat more slowly.  The larger kibble also serves to help clean their teeth - it's similar to the size of the SD Oral Care food.;0
16421;...that won't fall apart.  Quickly became a favorite.  It's nice and long and you can wiggle it like a snake or make it go way up...both cats love it!;0
92985;I bought this for my chihuahua and love that the hook is appropriately sized for small dogs. Don't worry though - the larger sized leashes have larger hooks for big dogs. It's lightweight and secure. No worries about losing my little girl!;0
75730;Our plastic scoopers were breaking so we got these.  Bought two of these - very happy with them. They are very strong and have the right size of slots for sifting cat litter. I recommend these, they are well worth the price.;0
56290;I always order this for our bob whites, and they seem to love it, I would recommend this brand to anyone interested!;0
24300;Works great for 2 of my cats...the others will not use probably due to design and they're too big for this opening.  But I love that there's no more litter outside of this box or overspray outside the box. Awesome product!;0
58564;I was really surprised at the brightness of this light.  Now it's not like a spotlight or anything, but I expected it to be pretty dim with the led lights.  There are 6 lights on it, and they create a pretty good light.  The light extends past the 25 feet of Haley's retractable leash.  I did aim it a little too low, so I have to angle the handle up into the air when the leash gets extended all the way.  The light is a little bulky and may get in the way for some people, but I haven't had a problem yet.  It velcros on, so you can remove it when needed.  I leave it on so that the velcro doesn't pick up fuzz, dirt, lint, etc., causing it to lose its effectiveness at sticking.  I don't need the light very often, but it does come in handy for those times when it is needed.;0
72567;I have owned three Dogtra training collars and three Dogtra No Bark Collars, the YS500 is my least favorite so far for two reasons.#1 The collar does not recognize and stimulate my large dog while he barks in a higher pitched, constant nuisance tone, perhaps the vibration sensor is only for deep throated barks, in this manner it worked fine.#2 Dogtra's actual collar has failed and my dog escaped on one occasion, a Dogtra Customer Service Agent e-mailed to explain the collar is not meant to have a leash attached, but I could not find this specific caution in any of their warranty, or product manual verbiage. My collar failed at the buckle, the metal actually snapping off and revealing cast metal that has been plated with a rust-resistant shiny metal, perhaps chrome, at any rate this breakage led to a complete collar failure and release of my dog.Though these collars are not for continuous usage, when you are paying hundreds of dollars for a training collar and close to $100 for a No Bark Collar I believe Dogtra has an obligation to provide a collar capable of functioning without fail if it is necessary to occasionally attach a leash to the Dogtra unit.;0
76762;The dog thinks these are great. She recommends them highly and thinks we need more in inventory. Guess I will do as told.;0
12358;This thing is just adorable and sounds like a real chimp. My puppy loves to play with it. I have nothing more to say but I needed 2 more words to complete the review. Who knew they were counting.;0
146948;The hole in the middle is a great feature of this.  Never thought my cat would like one of these, but she LOVES it.  I actually had to hide it at night because she made so much noise all night running into it and rolling around.  It makes a little crinkly noise which I think she loves.  The ball is actually still attached also (impressive after 2 months...)  It does take up some room in the apt, but worth it because she loves it so much!;0
100559;I've been using Zero Odor to remove my dog's urine stains and odor on the carpet. It is expensive so I decided to try FizzIon. A package of two tablets cost me around $5.50 and only one tablet is needed to equal to a 16oz bottle of Zero Odor. FizzIon has done an alright job removing the stain but I noticed that a muggy urine smell still lingers despite me following the instructions for odor removal (spray to remove stain, spray again and wait to dry for odor removal). I had to go back to purchasing Zero Odor but using it in conjunction with FizzIon to save product. Since FizzIon is so inexpensive, I can use it for stain removal, which requires a lot more product, and I finish it up with a few sprays of Zero Odor to remove the odor.;0
51052;They are made differnetly and that attracts my cats. Someone is hiding them and keeping them for special occasions. They still are clean. The string does come off and unravals. Great fun until then.;0
18582;I have 3 lab mixes and we seem to go thru tons of toys. This is the only toy I have found that my lab/golden retriever puppy cannot destroy. This toy is thrown all around the house and 2 of my dogs even play ball by throwing it at each other. I cut off the feet before I give them a new one just to keep them from eating the feet. If you have a chewer this is the toy to buy.;0
43374;This is easy to put together and a nice product overall.  The only problem I had is that they supply rubber feet that push into the bottom of the panels.  On two of the panels, the holes were not drilled into them in order to fit the feet into.  I had to drill the holes, myself.;0
83442;This toy was much stronger than most of the other dog toys out there that &#34,guarantee&#34, not to break for heavy chewers. The fact is, they all fall apart at one point or another. This toy actually lasted quite a while surprisingly - about 4 or so months. Then one day I came home and there was a million pieces laying around my house. I'm not sure if my lab never really chewed on it much over those 4 months, or if it deteriorated to the point of destruction.;0
2733;nice size for my American terrier.....so far has held up well. She loves toys that squeak and keeps her busy.;0
87197;"FIRST REVIEW:  My kitten really, really liked this toy.  I didn't use it every day because I didn't want her to tire of it, but I did use it frequently when she got in one of her ""hyper"" moods.  It was easy to carry from room to room, which I did since she likes to be where I am.The batteries have only had to be changed once, and so when I turned it on for her today and it didn't send out a beam, I assumed it needed new batteries again.  No!  I tried many new batteries, not believing that the toy itself could be damaged, but still no beam.  It turns on, makes it's regular sound, but there's no beam.If it's worth the money for the length of time this will last, buy it.  If you want something that's going to last, forget it.I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it was a lot of fun for a while.EDIT:  after contacting the seller, he sent me a brand new one and it's worked perfectly ever since.  He didn't even want the old one returned, so I'm raising my star count to 5 and recommending the seller.";0
95304;We have two dogs and the larger of the two was just barely too big for the small sturdibag. After reading some online reviews, we sized up to the large to use for a trip back home for Christmas. This was very roomy for her and she seemed comfortable, but it was hard to get under and out from under the seat on the plane-- and kind of stressful for my dog. Otherwise, this is a great carrier, sturdibags are very well made, I like the top vents so I can see my dog from above and the fact that they flex down. I would definitely recommend this carrier, although if you're going with a large (rather than the small), get it in black so it's less obvious that it's slightly larger than regulation. The small is awesome, so if you're dog fits in it I DEFINITELY recommend it.;0
21215;"I bought this toy and the ""hide-a-squirrel"". Though my dogs like the squeakers on the bees, they don't ""dig"" into it like they do the squirrel. Not sure if it is because there isn't a hole in the top like the squirrels....If you are looking at this toy, look at the squirrels first. All 3 of my dogs go NUTS over them, the bees are left for whomever didn't get the squirrels fast enough! (This is still a good toy....I would just recommend it 2nd to the squirrels)";0
92771;Much better than the old one that i had which would leak and was not made well. This one has really thick plastic and a very good cage hanging system.;0
132631;My cat ate the Classic for years, but this product has gravy which he just loves!  And the solid pieces seem easy to chew for my older, nearly toothless cat!;0
26739;Best cat litter on the market!  It works wonderfully and is extremely lightweight.  Easy to cleanup and the cats seem to like it as well as the traditional sand.;0
82378;I've tried a few different kinds of dust - weighing price vs quality i decided to give this a try over oxbow. My chinchilla LOVES this dust bast and spends more time rolling around in it than others. I also find that it doesn't stick to his fur as much - and therefore doesnt transfer everywhere immediately after a dust bath. I dont find myself sneezing as much with this product as well. Its great value for quality and price.;0
153857;My dog will grudgingly take this.  He often leaves it for days before giving in... I don't think he likes them...;0
4215;One of those things to have on hand in case ph goes nuts! Does its job.;0
19942;Scooter, my son's cockatoo, loved this Wesco shreddable toy so much that once he started pecking at it, he couldn't stop.After about an hour of constant action it was totally gone!  I will order this again soon but next time I will only allow him at the toy for 15 mins. at a time so it will last longer.;0
55086;Thi is a very nice crate which fits my maltese very well. She loves to go take naps in it and eats her dinner there undisturbed.;0
139345;Quality ingredients at an attractive price.  Bag is resealable so food stays fresh.  I give this to my dog with additional salmon oil and warm water or some carrageenan-free canned food (Weruva or Nature's Instinct) and she woofs it down.  (Without the oil and water, she eats it, but holds out a little to see if she can get the extras...);0
109540;These larger crates were the size we needed and we wanted a door on the front and on the side.  We have 2 dogs that are in the 80 lb. range and we move the crates in different parts of the house as the seasons change.  The rubber skids on the bottom are great for keeping the crate from scratching your floor when you lift to clean underneath.  The trays are cheaply made and were cracked on the ends when shipped, took photos and sent to company. They shipped replacements, took about a week to get them.  Wire is flimsy and cheap as well.  If you are on a budget and do not have a dog who will try and get out, this is for you.  The latches need to be tweaked and sometimes you have to fight to get them to latch correctly, again if you have a dog that will not try to get out, this is not a big deal.  I have only had these for a month, so time will tell how long they last with being moved allot and taken outside and cleaned. Also these types of trays will warp if left out to dry in the sun.;0
34376;I had bubble bars all over my 30 gallon tank - probably 3 10&#34, bubble bars - but the pump was still so effective water was spraying into the air. Also, the vibrating buzzing noise didn't seem worth it and my fish have been just fine without. Generally I like the shape and will hang on to it in case I change my mind and need an air pump again.;0
95238;Used this product to get rid of giardia, which vwt neds could not.  My little dog got sick on meds, so I found this product because i prefer natural solutions.  I have saved so much on vet bills, plus I know what to look for when she shows signs of tummy issues.  Some dogs have recuurent bouts with giardia, coccidia, etc. and this is so helpful.  Also, use products by Homeopet, and they are also very good.  I like using products that do not have unsafe side effects and actually help.  highly recommend.;0
69884;This works a heck of a lot better than having to put your mouth on the tube (yuck). The self starting ones usually work well, until the water level gets too low and then you're SOL. With this one I was having trouble getting it started when the water got too low, but if you put your hand over the base when you squeeze, you get a lot more suction and it starts no problem.;0
46070;I don't have any goats.... but I do have dogs.  We rescue dogs and first thing we do is get rid of the bad critters the dogs may have picked up.  Very safe product that is effective.  Not a toxic product to dogs so no side effects.  Due to our dogs having lots of contact with other dogs in dog parks etc. a treatment on a regular basis is the norm.  Much cheaper then the same stuff packaged for dogs.;0
106462;Bught this for a foster cat who was being very aggressive towards one of our cats.  Had wanted to consider adopting this particular foster boy.  Unfortunately, neither these treats nor anything else I tried has worked, he still wants to attack the other cat when he gets the chance.  Having said that, I'm guessing this is individual, based on cat and situation.  Feliway, for instance, has made the world of difference for some of my fosters.  However, it didn't help my current kitty at all.  I think sometimes you just have to try a few different things and hope you come across what works.;0
120623;I purchased this item as a supplement for my show dogs.  It helps maintain beautiful fur and skin.  It is easy to put in their dish and for them to swollow without a problem;0
122593;my cats love it and spend hours playing with it.  I would say buy it if you want active cats.;0
141656;I have 4 indoor cats, and 4 litter boxes.  Two of them are the Breeze litter boxes, and two are regular litter boxes.The deal on the 10 pack of pads is cost beneficial (I buy at Walmart and they are $4.98 each plus tax) and free shipping on Amazon Prime.  Often the store is out, so I figured I'd stock up.;0
101817;I have a Black Russian Terrier who is almost 2. He loves water bottles. This toy works great. Easy to take out and replace the water bottles. He hasn't torn it as he chews it and does not even try to rip and tear. When he has a water bottle I worry that he will cut his gums on some of the sharper edges, with the cover there is no worry about that. He has 2 of these and loves to chew on them.;0
60426;I first purchased the EarthBath Grooming Wipes from our local pet supply store. I picked the hypoallergenic unscented wipes because I imagine that dogs--with their sensitive sense of smell--must go nuts when humans insist on spraying them down with scented products.Even though they're unscented, these wipes leave my dog smelling clean (she doesn't smell like Bath & Body Works...she just smells clean). They leave her coat shiny and soft (she's a beagle-daschund, so she has short hair), and she actually enjoys being wiped down with these.The problem with the 100-count box of wipes is that the package doesn't keep them moist. I had to add a bit of water to every wipe in the first half of the container because the ones on the top were so dry. The first time I bought these wipes, I purchased the smaller 28-count pouch, and the wipes stayed moist in the package. I'll buy the smaller package in the future.;0
97540;Our kitty is 5 months old, and we got him when he was 11 weeks old. Since day one, he's had terrible gas! We were using the cheaper dry cat food because i was convinced cat food was cat food, but after trying Purina Kitten chow, Meow Mix, Purina Kit and Kibooble, Whiskers, I've realized they're not all the same and that it really is worth spending a little more for a good quality dry cat food. After researching all kinds of dry food online, and being desperate for this cat to stop with the terrible, smelly gas, I decided upon Blue dry kitten food because of its high quality, all natural, no junk added ingredients, and after about a week of him eating this consistently, NO MORE GAS!!!! It's a miracle! His coat is beautiful and shiny, he's lively, energetic, and just a very healthy, non smelly cat! Fabulous product!! Highly recommended by our cat, Tom, and his owners who are no longer afraid to have him sit on their laps or even be in the same room as him :);0
133088;Got three  two pink and one  green love these you can see at night these are my summer collars since they are bright and beautiful colors. Will be ordering this brand again!! Very well made!;0
48709;I thought I'd try this first without anything in it, just to see if my cats liked it.  They will eat anything that doesn't eat them first, so imagine my surprise that they wouldn't go near this.  Not much use if they don't like it.;0
9557;Having a chunky bunny, my vet told me to stay away from Fiesta bunny food. Like everything that I put in front of my ravenous rabbit, he loves this food and his weight management had improved.;0
63738;I really like this nail trimmer. Its really smooth cutting and doesn't split my dogs nails. Her nails are never sharp after using this tool. Never seems to hurt her either. Highly recommend this trimmer;0
135735;I switched to this food, Taste of the Wild, from Orijen puppy food.  My pup was having foul gas and frequent stooling. As Orijen was so highly rated, I was not so sure it was the Orijen food, but after reading some other reviewers stating that Orijen had caused the same in their dog, I decided to switch foods.  Well since the switch, the air quality has improved and the stooling seems more normal and less frequent. The pup  is very healthy, robust, and has a shiny coat. We do alternate with homemade meals, but he does enjoy his meals with this food. I think it is a great choice of food for a grain-free diet.;0
15655;This is so much better than a regular litter box. I'm noticing  less litter on the floors which means less sweeping/cleaning than needed. Cats love it too and considering that we have 4 cats, that's definitely a good thing.;0
78131;"I have an 11 pound Couton De Tulear.  Small sharp teeth.Dog loves them.These don't last long.  From a value standpoint, I prefer ""Checkups,"" when Costco has them in stock.";0
39026;I wish I had found these before I spent so much money on other toys for my cat. All I have to do to give myself an hour or two of alone time is to drop one of these babies on the floor and walk away. He will play with these things for hours! I bought three packages of these, and gave one to a friend who lives down the street from me. His cat loves them just as much.Get these. Your cat will thank you.;0
4827;"What a great little bubbler!  I have to say, if you don't follow the instructions and soak it for an hour or more before hooking it up, you deserve for it not to work properly.  I did so, and it is blowing out so much air that I had to tone it down a bit with the gang valve.  Have two of these hooked up to a ""60-100"" air pump in a 150 gallon tank, and it is an amazing show for sure!  The fish love it and the tank has cleared up more that it was before hand.Great purchase, take your time and follow the instructions, and you should have a fine air bubbler in your tank.Yes it floats just a bit, be prepared to cover it with your substrate.  I completely covered my two and they still bubble like they were sitting on the top of the substrate.";0
9897;Most litters are made for human convenience but can be quite a bit of pollution for your cat's lungs with the dust and the heavy perfumes. Many stick to paws and with their clumping, can actually cause digestive issues when cats lick the litter from their paws.Consumers are becoming more aware today about how heavily perfumed items or artificial items collect on our pets paws...from floor cleaners to  perfumes to litters and in going more green and all-natural, new items are being developed to fill the need to stay healthy yet convenient.Fortunately this litter remains affordable as well, and clumps just as well as any artificial heavily scented litter. There is no cat smell left behind and quite frankly our household feels it works better than old school litter.We have a Maine Coon cat who is as large as a dog, he is a real test to any litter box but he took right to this new litter and it's one we'll stick with for his health and ours, as well as the fact that it simply works.  Easy to scoop.  Simple to clean.;0
10674;Bouli, my 50 lb. street rescue and power chewer, loved his Kong Extreme from the minute he got it, even with nothing inside. So far (two months) it is holding up great. He loves the bounce, and I love the smooth edges when he shoves it against me or drops it on my bare foot. It's also easy to keep clean. The downside is that Bouli, being a water dog, expected it to float like his other rubbery toys do and kept dropping it in the pool. When it sank straight to the bottom, he'd either stand there and bark until I fished it out, or jump in and try to dive for it until I thought he'd drown from exhaustion. This got old real quick, and the solution was to stuff it with something that floats. So far a piece of packing foam works best, because he's not all that interested in digging it out. The only other issue is that black is hard to see in the garden, under furniture, or when you're heading to the fridge or bathroom in the middle of the night. But I'm delighted to have found another toy that ... so far ... hasn't ended up in pieces in the trash before the debit was processed at the bank.;0
31500;I have three Persian cats. One of my cats is a little over weight at almost 14 pounds so I opted for this Bolster cat bed as it is sturdy enough to hold a lot of weight.  I bought this a while ago and my cats love it, the only problem was is I only had the one so I just bought another one (the same kind) recently. Now I have two bolster beds.Its easy to install, fits perfectly snug on the window ledge and looks very nice. The bed is soft and the outer cover unzips so you can pop it in the wash. My cats love these.;0
109131;I had high hopes for this since it was a Nylabone..my dog won't even give it a second sniff...;0
50628;This product is not cheap, so I thought twice before purchasing it. However, no regrets. It does its job well and it makes my life so much easier. I clean litter once a day now instead of 2-3 times a day in the past. We've had Litter robot for about half a year. The wiring got loose a bit at the back of the robot and sometimes (rarely) it stops in the middle of the cleaning process. We put some tape over there and seems to help. Another little problem we've experienced is that the sensor that reacts when the cat steps on the step to get into the box has been malfunctioning, so I have to press it manually occasionally, so that robot can spin. Despite some imperfections mentioned above, it is a really great product, especially for the household with more than one cat.;0
82974;My dogs love these items.  I can tear them in half to give to my smaller two who way much less, than my other one.  They have never thrown up, which is something common they do with other oral chews.  Well worth the price.;0
39028;My two cats love these springs.  Thing is.....they are all over my house!  It keeps the cats playing, active, and looking for trouble.Recommended.;0
622;Works great, but so disappointing to find one in the Dollar store a week after buying this one.  So I bought that one too and am saving this expensive one for when the cheap one breaks...a lot of use and still going great.Feel a bit foolish for spending so much here.;0
40768;Aug 5th, I bought it,Aug 8th, I recieved it,Aug 16th, first day to place the training kit on the toilet, (I was waiting for the flushable litter during 8th-16th), and my cat successfully used it on 16th, in the begining, he Meowing and walking around the room to looking for litter, and not confident to jump on the toilet, so i carried him and place him there so he finally learned to use it by himself in the same day,Aug 20th, I open the first little hole, he been curious about that and touched the water through it, and he successfully used the toilet also in the same day, but he pee and shit on the litter but not into the hole,Aug 24th, I open the circle #2, he has no problem to use it at all in the same day,Aug 26th, I open the circle #3, still no problem to use it in the same day, and I first time hear my cat pee in the water, that is so exciting and cute,Aug 28th, I open the circle #4, its the last circle, HERE, I met some little trouble, the first 4 steps are too nice, so i was a little bit rush into this step, and the circle is kind of big, my cat may not feel so comfortable with it, so he peed and shitted on the floor, I am not so sure if that is the reason, or because that is the day i took him a shower, but anyway i decided to slow down a little bit, but I didnt do anything to help my cat yet, I heard he pee in it right in the Aug 29th morning,So since 28th, I let the kit on the toilet with the litter inside, and let it there for many days already, never add litter in it again, and my cat became mastered on it. I even took Videos of it, and all my friends are so suprised to that.I am so proud of my cat, He already ready to use the toilet without any help, but i just left the last piece on it for longer to be very very sure.The totally days I used to train my cat is 14 days, two weeks!! TWO WEEKS!!!! So great!! Now, no more litter needed. I will start to train my cat to flush now!!;0
35610;"If your dog is a vigorous eater and pushes the bowl all over the place, then this is the bowl for them. They are virtually ""no slide"" bowls on floors or carpeting.  I wish I knew about them before I bought tons of other bowls.";0
125921;It's fine, holds up well, but it doesn't get very much use.  The dog doesn't have any interest in it.;0
118693;will be reordering soon, cats can't get enough or I can't grow it fast enough but they know where I keep it and if I just walk by they come running to see if I am going to put it on the floor them.;0

134951;This keeps my boy nice and cozy and I love the fact that it's easy to take on and off . .not to mention downright cute and reversible. We live in the Midwest so during the nasty winter months, I keep him warm by putting the fleece side against his coat.  I highly recommend this product.;0
123213;I like this well enough, my dog is a little hesitant with it and I think it is because she is used to the bacon or meat type paste. I brush her teeth every day and while she isn't thrilled she will sit for it to get a treat.;0
14443;I wouldn't say that I am the most uncoordinated person on earth, but I sure felt like it when I was trying to scoop up after my dogs with a claw-type scooper. Actually, only of our dogs poops in inappropriate place, and she's a chihuahua, so the size of this scooper is more than sufficient, and I find it much easier to handle and operate than the claw type.;0
101013;One thing I like about this leash...the pattern!  Silly, I know.  But I like that it's a little different from the plain red or blue retractable leashes that I always get.It's a sturdy, well made device.  I don't worry that my pug (about 22 pounds is going to break the leash...he's a strong little guy) even though a small is only supposed to be for up to 14 pounds.  To be honest, I think a medium would be just too big for a dog his size.There are a few things that take some getting used to.  In the past the retractable leashes I have used, you simply move up the little button to lock the leash, but this one you actually have to flip it-sort of like a light switch-and that took me a few tries to get used to.  I would say anyone with larger hands, so most men, would find this rather uncomfortable.  I can't really get all four of my fingers around the handle comfortably, so I know my husband and older sons' can't either, making this difficult to hold securely.And then there is the price.  If you have ever bought a leash like this, you know they can be pricey, anywhere from $15-$30 dollars.  This one is at the top of the price point.  So, while I love the little graphics, I am not sure if that makes it worth $30.;0
144705;I'm very pleased with this product. I wanted to find Da Bird that had the &#34,full pole&#34,, not the kind I was seeing that had the pole in two parts, that you had to put together. I felt that one solid piece would be sturdy, rather then a weak spot where the two pieces were joined.  I finally found it from the seller CoolCyberCats,  They shipped it super fast and it came mailed in a hard tube, which was a really nice touch, since I was concerned that the pole might get snapped in shipping.  The cats absolutely love it, even the kitty that only really likes the laser toy, was jumping around and joining in. I have bought the cats poles with feathers on the end but this one by far is the best, they have a level of excitement with this that the other feather poles don't come close too. The sound it makes fluttering through the air really gets them jumping, playing and I'm glad they are getting lots of exercise. One of the cats likes it so much, she stands near it and meows to me, asking to make the feather fly!  I will only buy this kind in the future.;0
108469;I bought this when I pup was only 2 months old (only about 3 pound ish). At that time, he was kinda too big for him to handle, right now he's like 8 pounds, he can make it squeaky easily and carry it around with his little month...;0
29565;I am really impressed with this leash. I love the handle as i'ts really soft especially when you have two dogs pulling. I like to that the leash does not get tangled up when the dogs start doing circles around each other. Really adjustable too.;0
88630;My dogs love to rip apart tennis balls and eat them. Having already had one surgery for eating something he wasn't supposed to, we try to keep them away from tennis balls. They like to play with balls, though, so I decided to try this one.They will play with it, but definitely don't like it as much as a tennis ball. But it has held up to the chewing, so it did exactly what it was supposed to.;0

110143;It's a good size pad.  The problem is the urine goes through it and onto the floor.  Not completely, but enough that I can see the shine of urine on the floor after I pick up the pad and have to clean the laminate floor underneath it.  I was hoping to avoid the laminate floor getting soiled by having the pad.  My dog weighs 60 lbs so has a good amount of urine.  The pad is plenty big so the urine does not spill over the edge, just goes through it.  Disappointed.;0
73675;"Blue Buffalo Spa Select is great! Top of the line ingredients, human food grade-- in addition to the indoor cat formula there's a chicken version and a fish version. This food meets a very high standard. No yucky meat ""by-products"", meat and meat meals are the top ingredients, plus a host of wholesome and varied ingredients and probiotics.On top of that, this is an incredibly palatable food. My cat LOVES it. In fact, she scarfs it right down, when she typically has just grazed on a piece or two at a time of other premium foods. I have to be careful to use a measuring cup and not overfeed her, 'cause she will seek me out and meow for more!Blue Buffalo uses a unique process to manufacture ""lifebits"" which are added to the food. These smaller, darker pieces are cold formed in order to maintain nutrients. I don't believe any other company incorporates this kind of element into cat or dog food.I came across this cat food at the local Tractor Supply. I'd never heard or read about Blue Buffalo, but I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo dog food for my golden retrievers, too.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Here's a summary of the nutritional information:-Recommended daily feeding chart-- amount varies based on age, activity level, breed, and environement, but in general a 5-9 pound cat will eat 1/4-1/2 cup, while a 10-14 pound cat will eat 1/2-1 cup.-One cup contains 478 calories-Major ingredients:Deboned chicken, chicken meal, whole ground barley, fish meal, oatmeal, whole ground brown rice, whole potatoes, chicken fat (preserved with natural mixed tocopherols), natural chicken flavor, dried egg, dried cellulose, whole sweet potatoes, whole carrots, cranberries, blueberries, flaxseed (natural soource of Omega 6 fatty acids), barley grass, dried parsley, alfalfa meal, kelp meal, taurine, l-carnitine, l-lysine, ycca schidigera, green tea extract, turmeric, salmon oil (natural source of Omega 3 fatty acids), black malted barley, dried chicory root, fructooligosaccarides, oil of rosemary, the expected vitamins and minerals, and several probiotics (lactobacillus acidolphilus, bacillus subtilis, bifidobacterium thermophilum, bifidobacgterium longum, enterococcus faecium).I hope this helps you evaluate whether or not this food is a good match for your feline friend.  My cat and I have been really happy with it.";0

38292;My Whippet/Aussie mix likes this bed only when I put her Pet Dreams Plush cushion on it, as she needs padding to be comfortable.  She looks pure Whippet except for the Aussie merle coloring - her body frame just needs more cushioning.  I thought the elevated bed would be nice and cool in the summer, but that doesn't matter to her.  This bed would be great for dogs that have more body padding and enjoy sleeping on a cool surface.  Depending on your dog, it can be a great bed.;0

74322;"I am unaware if it fits the door space of the smaller cages, but the nest box isn't large enough to attach to theVision Bird Cage Model L02 - Largewithout leaving a significant gap over the top. Even if it does fit the door space on your particular model, it's a horrible constriction of cage use because you will have to remove it every time you need to gain access to the inside of the cage to handle the animals or change food and water, which will disturb the birds and anything inside the nest box. The Vision cage, unlike almost every bird cage, comes with no breeding doors to allow placement of a nest box on the exterior of the cage, which is essentially an industry standard even in cages designed for companion birds.This is too large to fit inside a cage as it needs to be placed in a top corner for most species (excluding budgerigars), which uses valuable real estate, and makes access to the nest box difficult. I had to cut several bars on the left side of the cage in order to give access to the entrance hole of the nest box which I placed on the outside. This is something no consumer should have to do and it is a grievance because it causes permanent damage.For the nest box itself, I find the plastic material to be preferable to wood because it discourages chewing and it is much more sanitary in addition to being easier to clean than traditional wooden nest boxes. It's relatively easy to get together the first time. I don't like that it isn't completely ""airtight"" except for the entrance hole because it allows light to intrude and could be a risk for even the slightest drafts to chicks (which are dangerous in a bird room anyway). Regarding the green door that slides up for observation, the lip around the bottom connecting part is not high enough to contain a good amount of nesting material inside, which is yet another design flaw considering how close the round nest bowl is placed to this observation door. The box is apparently designed with the slick plastic trays so nesting material doesn't need to be used, but if something like shavings is not used a breeder risks producing chicks with splayed legs.In short, the use of plastic in this is a very good thing, but the way it comes together in the end with both nest box concept flaws and a complete miss as for use with the Vsion cage, it is not a good investment and I will not recommend the product or purchase another. It may perhaps be good with cages that are quite large or even in an aviary, but for use with a Vision cage it is a failure.";0
85457;I buy chews to keep in the cage and spread through the house. Every now and then I'll see him nibble at a puzzle crisp but he doesn't want anything to do with the apple wood chews. Thankfully these were not that expensive. I may order the puzzle crisps if they are sold by themselves otherwise I'll be looking into other chews from now on.;0
123017;My kitty actually likes the taste and licks it off the brush! This is great since brushing your cat's teeth is important in order to help prevent tooth decay.;0
88441;Life has changed in our household because of this product. Give it a chance to work. On one cat, it worked within a week. On another cat it took a few weeks to start calming him down. It works on scaredy cats, tough/angry cats and alpha male cats. I have 8 and all have very different personalities. I am currently using them on 3 of my cats and our house is amazingly different! It's worth the money. And for those of you who state it smells funny, that's the whole point. Excellent price on-line versus in the stores - 65% cheaper for same product!;0
109972;I have a 7 pound yorkie who's always used pads to go to the bathroom. These are the worst ones I've ever used. Not worth the cheap price! Any liquid quickly spreads out on the entire pad and if it's near the edge, it can spill over onto your floor. I usually only have to change my pads twice a week but I feel like I'm changing these every few days! Will not be buying again.;0
124005;After reading some reviews that their dogs didn't like them, I was a bit worried as my dogs can be picky at times.  But no worries here, my dachsund and sharpei mix gobbled these right up!  My big mix practically woofed it down to the point I'm not sure he chewed much so I'm not sure he got the full effect, but my little guy enjoyed it, so I'm glad they like these treats and they're good for them, so thats what matters to me!  I am always looking for new ways to get some healthy into my boys as I'm sure most dog owners are so when I seen these I thought they were worth the try, and the boys like them so I'm recommending them!;0
57613;This is a terrific product for my skin sensitive dog and my cat too.  My dog doesn't really like his food when I put salmon oil in it, so these gel caps are a great alternative.  The gel caps are shaped like little fish.  If I want to feed my dog the entire gel cap, I hide a couple of them in his food and he eats them up like he would eat his normal food, especially in wet food.  Sometimes he'll spit it out if I put them in his dry food, so I wrap the little fish gels in a slice of roast beef and he swallows them right down.  If I want to sprinkle the fish oil in my cat's food, all I have to do is twist the tail off the little fish gel cap and squeeze into the cat's food and he eats his food up enthusiastically.  The fish caps seem to be doing wonders for both animals.  A great product by a company (Animal Essentials) that I'm really becoming a fan of.  A great idea that works.;0

So I have to camouflage it with other treats so that he does begrudgingly eat it.I am not sure if the Daily Best are doing anything, but they sure do smell powerful! Yes it has a powerfully strong icky smell for such tiny bits. This is powerful for my nose, now imagine a cat's sensitive nose??I bought a few of these bags with high hopes based on the reviews and the dissatisfaction and regret happens to us all at one time or the other doesn't it?It just goes to show how individual and unique each cat is!So, now I am just slowly going through the bags (not daily because Tommy the Cat will catch on and decide not to eat anything that seems to be camoflaged in goodies).Sadly I am not likely to purchase these again and they were not cheap.;0
114123;I bought this for my 75lb lab, and ended up returning it because it was so heavy. It really is for the largest dogs out there, my poor guy didn't want to drag it around with him. It seemed very durable and like it wouldn't break, but it was way too heavy.;0
54156;This is the second time I have bought this same harness (not because it wore out but because my dog lost weight).  My dog has very sensitive skin and other ones would rub him raw around his chest and armpit area where his hair is a lot shorter.  This one with the fleece lining works great for him.  And the color is nice.  I would say it is a little closer to a bright orange coral color than true orange.;0
81984;We got this for our two guinea pigs to give them more room than the cage we already had. We have had this for about a month and love it. They seemed unsure about the ramp but I put one guinea pig on one side and the other on the other side. When one of them came across to find his friend he realized how much fun it was going over the ramp and kept running back and forth over it. Now they run all over the cage and love all the room they have.For the most part they only pee in the room with the bedding but occasionally they do pee in the corner of the other room but not often. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and so are my cavies! By the way the plus has the ramp cover, divider wall and the top along with the cage and bottom.;0
157523;Adams Flea and Tick Spot On for large dogs has work well for us since we switched from the vet's repellant of choice: Frontline.We have 3 dogs, all in the 50-80 lbs. range.  As you can imagine, price is a factor for anything that we buy for our dogs.  However, we never wanted to change from our high-priced repellant because it worked and we knew, from experience, what it's like to live in a house with fleas!!Since we switched to Adams (about 4 months), there have been no flea sightings and the few ticks that we found on the dogs were dead.We're saving about 40% on the cost plus the convenience of having it shipped to our home is a big plus.Great product and great value.;0
80026;"These are thick, high-quality bully sticks - not the cheap, thin ones you find elsewhere. Those familiar with the product know they do have a bit of a smell. We stick with bully sticks for my two pugs because they last through three evenings of serious chewing before they get down to 2"" nubs that I throw away to prevent choking. The company, Best Bully Sticks, is excellent to work with and prompt.";0
141905;my dog just loves.  Thought I'd try this bacon flavor.  Gosh surprise surprise she loves them.  I now have tried all the flavors of Pet Botanics training rewards and have gotten doggie approval on all.I particularly like the size since I don't want anything huge in my pocket while walking but need to carry a bunch for training purposes.  These are perfect for that.I don't think you can go wrong with this product.;0
81040;This toy is very dangerous for kittens. My kitten was playing with this and was having fun, then a few minutes later I heard the kitten crying and howling in a panic. My husband and I ran to see what was going on. The kitten had her arm stuck in the toy, she had reached her arm all the way in to get the ball and could not get her arm out because it was pass her elbow, and the bend in her elbow couldn't get back out, she was stuck and in great pain.We could not get her arm out because the top part was already locked into place (something you do when you build it) so we could not slide it off, and meanwhile the kitten is crying in pain and now we are starting to panic, so my husband pulled the plastic top and just cracked the whole piece off to get her arm free. She limped around a little, but she is thankfully okay, no permanent damage. This was a really scary and upsetting for all of us.Maybe this would be okay for adult cats since they can't fit their whole arm in, but I'm never going to take that chance and use this toy again, I'm sending it back.;0
22944;"My little Pug Dog is in training as my service dog. I get around OK but often can't bend by the end of the day and some days I can barely get off of the sofa so her jobs are to pick things up for me or to collect and bring things to me. Kevin works hard and she plays hard. She has an acrylic addiction so her trainer said to ""keep her in new toys as much as possible"" and that she'd probably go though ""a lot of them"". So far the Kong Brand has held up best for us and this one came with spare squeakers too!";0
22381;got this to treat my dogs' pads from this really bad winter we are having. It doesn't smell, in fact when i opened it, I was on the floor and my girl dog ran over and started licking and eating it right away. Not really hard to use.  I don't know if it made their feet more slippery on the hard wood though. didn't really make a mess. I got this for conditioning of their feet from being outdoors. Not really to repel rocksalt like intended.;0
133731;There's a nice selection/variety of toys in here, so if you're not sure yet what your cat or kitten likes to play with the most, this grab bag is a good idea to help you find out.;0
73814;I have three cats, they all love catnip. This catnip mist spray did nothing for them. They were interested in the spray as I was putting it on something but after the item dried they showed little or no interest. They like the dried catnip much better. This didn't work for my house.;0
5881;my 55-gallon community tank is not planted, but not for lack of trying (insufficient led lighting). so i didn't buy this product to keep fighting that losing battle. the reason i picked this up is because the tank has been infested with hard-to-kill black beard algae. at first i tried a couple different types of algae eater fish to clean it up. they cleaned the tank up quite nicely, but they didn't touch the black stuff. then i started reading help forums, and it was mentioned that seachem flourish excel can reduce and even eliminate the dreaded black beard.i went to the local petsmart, and they wanted $18 for a bottle of this stuff. i thought, surely i can get it cheaper on amazon. so i checked it on my amazon mobile app, and it was $9.24 - almost half the price. i placed the order through amazon and had it two days later via prime.i have been adding it to my tank at about half the recommended dosage on the bottle, every other day. i figured if it didn't start to produce results i could up the dosage after a couple weeks. but within 5 days, the algae was starting to disappear! it's been about 3 weeks now, and almost all the black beard algae is gone. the fish also seem completely unaffected by this new chemical in their environment.will the seachem assist in plant growth? i would imagine so. but with the added benefit of controlling some nasty types of algae, this product is definitely worth keeping on hand from now on. maybe i can even give some new plants a shot...;0

16497;My cats loveDa Bird Cat Toy - Easy Store - 2 Part Pole, but there was an incident where one of my cats got the string wrapped around her leg.  She flew all over the house in a panic until she could finally be untangled.  They absolutely love Da Bird, so I wanted to get something similar that would be less likely to cause a repeat episode.  Unfortunately, they just aren't as enthralled by the Cat Dancer as they are with Da Bird.  I assume that it may have something to do with the way the feather on Da Bird bounces around like prey.  The Cat Dancer only keeps their attention for a few minutes before they get bored.  It's so inexpensive, and obviously lots of other reviews here attest to this toys' positive qualities, so I assume cats are more likely to enjoy this to than not.;0

24520;My pitbull ended up getting small spots of ringworm over her body and this shampoo worked to remedy the situation.Con:It does not lather very well and so you have to use a little more of it than you may intend.It required you to leave it on the dog for an extended period of time and they aren't supposed to lick it;0
136106;We got this after discovering that my standard poodle had bone cancer, to make it easier for him to get up on the bed where he liked to sleep.  Unfortunately, he didn't take to it: he seemed to find going up the incline intimidating.  He was not a well dog, however, so I don't blame this on the design of the piece.  As is so often the case with things I buy for pets, I have to remember that they may, or may not, accept it.  This was easy to assemble and quite sturdy: I am sorry that it didn't work for him.;0
16209;Bought this for our nipping pit puppy, it worked, however once he knew what it was for, it's hard to get close enough to spray it on him, he is fast. but I would recommend this!;0

23605;For ten years, we used Nature's Miracle and a similar liquid product from Drs. Foster & Smith. Both worked well, but both were fairly expensive. Then I found Odormute. Same benefit, just much cheaper and more flexible.Here's how to use it with carpets in a house with dogs:IF YOU HAVE A CARPET CLEANING MACHINE:We have aHoover SteamVac, highly recommended if you have dogs and carpets! For a few years, I pretreated stains with Natures Miracle in a garden sprayer, then cleaned using regular or pet carpet detergent. This worked well, in that the carpets were clean and odor free the next day. Now I mix up six tablespoons of Odormute to a gallon of water for pretreatment (at 10% the cost of Natures Miracle), plus a teaspoon of Odormute in mixed with regular carpet detergent. This formula works well. Another hint: Use boiling water in the carpet cleaner.If your carpets are soaked with urine, use my pretreatment formula instead of detergent in the carpet cleaner. After deodorizing, clean the carpets again with detergent to remove stains. Yes, this is two cycles, but it works.NO CARPET CLEANER:Mix a teaspoon of Odormute in a cup of hot water. Spray this on the carpet area to be treated and rub in well. If the spot is still wet 30 minutes later, blot it up.The concentration I recommend is stronger than the instructions give, but according to the instructions, using a higher concentration just speeds the reaction without adverse effects.Five stars for a superior product that costs less than the competition. Well done!;0
106546;This is not for a dog who is a chewer.  In under 24 hours my dog destroyed it.  I put it out with him while I was sleeping today and he left it alone (probably because he was outside playing).  I put it back in the freezer and gave it to him again when I was going to a show. When i returned I discoved he'd destroyed the cover and punctured several of the water pockets.  I also bought one of the gel mats. That one doesn't cool anywhere near as much as this mat, but he doesn't try and tear it up.;0
71777;My cats like this food and it seems to be good for them.  They look and act very healthy.I am pleased.;0
129460;My daughter's two demonic cats love this toy.  It drives them to utter madness in terms of excitement and frisky-ness.  I would definitely buy another of these and as soon as the kitties destroy this first one.....I'm on it.Highly recommended to every discerning cat toy buyer!;0
117128;I love the look and function of this box.  It's sleek and takes up little space.  My cats don't make near the mess they tend to with other boxes and it fits in a small space.  I'll be getting more as I replace the other boxes in my home.;0

Close enough.  It takes time patience, an appoinbtment with the vet (for the urinating problem), but I see small improvements every day.  I bought extra bottles of Feliway to put throughout the house and I really do see changes in their behaviour.  It gives me hope.";0

94345;My cats were not like some of the other reviews, they didn't always want to stay in it but that's probably because my husband let them run free in our back yard way sooner than I would have liked and they felt confined. I think it would work wonderful if you start with it and then let cats out later. Our kittens were only 8 weeks when hubby let them run free, then I spent the next 5 months trying to train them not to jump the fence!;0

155750;This is our young Maine Coon's favorite food. Okay, she likes snacks, and eats odd things like potato chips and green onion stalks. But when it comes to her primary diet, Hill's Ideal Balance Hairball Natural Chicken & Oats Recipe is her absolute favorite. For some reason, we've nicknamed them &#34,Peeblers&#34,. Believe it or not, she likes it more than canned food. I can't be more happy that we found a healthy food she enjoys, that helps keep the inevitable hairballs to a minimum. I know that this intended for adult cats, but don't tell her that!We have two older cats that like it, but not as much as she does. They'd rather have soft canned food, but won't turn their noses up if it is in the bowl. So as dry food goes, it gets high marks. The bag with a velcro closure is a nice touch as well. I just wish it wasn't quite so pricy.~ Kort;0
72962;As you probably know, since you are looking at this product, squeakers die in pet toys.  Prematurely probably, but the stuffing coming out is usually a concurrent event.  So getting these made me think life would be grand for the pet again. Wrong. There is nothing wrong with these squeakers, but what you are putting them in is mostly likely on it's way to the island of zombie rag toys (trash).  So here is a quick suggestion and my puppy seems to love it.  Take a pair of short tube socks, put three squeakers in one, twist once, then stuff it in on itself.  If you have ever folded socks you are right up to speed so far.  Then take that sock and put it into the other, and tie off the leg.  The squeakers are now 3-4 layers deep into tube socks.  That's more protection than any pet toy I know of.  Now get out those 12 colored Sharpies and draw a funny face on the sock.  Puppies can squeak and not puncture the squeakers.  Dogs don't chew tube socks very easily and tube socks are cheap by the dozen.;0
108022;I have Bulldogs.  I buy a lot of Kong toys.  I decided to try this woven stick since the rubber toys hurt when the dogs hit you with them :-), but it didn't last 20 minutes.  it has a lot of stitched joints and almost immediately, stuffing was evident.  Too bad, because they really did love the multiple holds and nubbins - but the design is flawed for tough dogs - there is no way that much stitching is going to hold up.;0
22193;This junk is horrible and it smells horrible too. If you use topical flea treatments like most of us do then stay away from this shampoo. It must strip the flea medicine from the dog 's skin the opposite of their claims. Instead I have a flea infested dog: he must have over 200 fleas. My baby has never suffered like this before and hopefully never again. I am through with this product!;0
43348;We bought this for our new baby Morkie to stay in. He is now 9 months old and goes to bed in it every night. He has room for his little bed and two pee pad just in case! Doesn't take up much room in the living room and is so much better than having your pet be stuck in a kennel all the time.;0

61298;My golden retriever was able to eat the everlasting treat fairly quickly. I have not bought any more replacements as he is very good at getting them out.I have however, found another excellent use for this. I put my dog's kibble inside and use it as a treat/food dispensing toy. He knows how to use other food dispensing toys and this is no different. He'll push it around with his nose and the food comes out. It take longer for him than our puppy that has smaller sized kibble that come out faster.So, those that say their dog loses interest in this toy once the everlasting treat is gone-- give the toy new life and make your dog use his brain!;0
136943;These cards are very durable and handy.  You can carry a few in your service dog vest and wallet for quick access and not worry about them being all ragged and worn.  I'm sure I'll buy again because there are far too many merchants and people in the general populace,  saying and asking things that are illegal and/or just rude.  I sometimes get impaient and give people a tongue lashing, but these are far more approriate to educate and inform folks.  See you soon!;0
70528;This is a quality bag of food for the price. It smells like salmon. On one hand, that makes it appear to be higher quality. On the other hand, your dog's breath may smell like salmon.;0

They have pretty much no smell and if you try to break them into pieces be careful because they are apt to crumble. Not a bad treat though especially if your dog has a sensitive stomach to treats.;0
14250;Great crate.  Easy to set up and take down and very secure.  I have yet to have my dog escape.  It's not near as heavy as my older wire crate is and its much easier to take places and set up.;0

73322;Calming is a needed product for both you & your overly hypertensive pup only.For your fur pal, it's so easy to feel a flight & fleet response,if the pup doesn't feel safe, or some outside influence has him, or her literally freaking out, & acts they're fear out, by trying to comfort themselves, by excessive chewing, or other destructive behavior as they're humans can't understand it.Calming helps.But it's meant to calm the nervous system, not knock your poor pooch out.So please, take care when using Calming to comfort them.Suggestion: Use varying  portions at a time, I recommend no more then two little halves, of the small bones, for stress preventive doses.Given only, as occasional treats, two times a day, for real stress filled days, or only one half as needed.Your the one who should learn, when to give as much as required, to your pups needs.Again, sparing is the key with any preventive.You want a well adjusted pup, then give them lots of love, patients, treats, & plenty of chewing toys, to prevent destructive behaviors, make it fun for your pet. & he, & she, will learn over time, not to chew your things, or fear an ant crossing the street.Remember they are more acute to sounds, we can't fathom or hear, so take this to heart, before shouting at your pal, for making a toy out of your favorite pump, or worse.Sometimes redirection can even help. Like a new, sweat sock, tied with a knot, to assist with bitable grip, for a smaller dog. Tell your pal, this is your sock, let's have some fun!Your dog will love you for giving him, or her the love & attention. & the more they chew on things you make clear, are theirs they will want to leave your socks, & other stuff alone.When giving dental chews, tell your fur buddy, to chew them good, & concentrate on praising your fur pal more often, for completing a small task, you expected of them, so that they know they did good.Positivity, stay positive! That's key, less scolding, & just don't blame your pet for everything.You need to rationalize, how would you feel if you couldn't get through to anyone, what would you do, to tell your pup you wanted something, water, food, toy?Sounds silly? Maybe but not to your fur pal...Just give them love & don't forget to take personal time for them as well.Pup's need lot's of guidance & care. So just put yourself in their paws so to speak.& only Use Calming with a lot of thoughtful consideration for your fur pal, other wise you might end up with an unhealthy result. Always check instructions, & ask a Vet if this is the right comfort aid, your particular pets needs. & Good luck. -BB;0

30499;My cats seemed to be amused to work for their food. One cat would roll the ball with her paws and nose, and the other would walk behind her and eat up whatever fell out -- teamwork! I knew they'd dig this ball because I had already made something similar out of a plastic water bottle before that they liked a lot.A few weeks after getting this, though, the ball was never to be found again. I think it may have rolled down into the dark basement at some point and became one with the clutter.+1 for the adjustable hole sizes. -1 for the mess that happens when trying to put the food in by hand (although this could be solved with a funnel).;0

But I wanted to give it a try as I have a 2014 Honda Accord and wanted to protect the doors. Well I experienced the same issue. If I place weights on the guards as some people suggested , they would just simply fall off. I have kept them anyway as it is the lesser of the two evils. They protect my doors a little but not alot. Note: Definitely cannot lower windows. They will come right off.;0
110362;Come my chinchilla's bath time, I cannot imagine it without using this superior product as most chin insiders will state.  It is very soft, very fine and chinchillas love it.And it is safe.  Many dusts sold for chinchillas are not.  They are scented (not natural for a chin) and simply made of outdoor sand.  The best chin dusts are made of ground pumice stone.This particular chin dust comes highly recommended by long-time chin owners like myself who have been caring for these delightful crepuscular rodents coming on 18 years now.  My chin, Danny Boy, loves it (see my Profile for a glimpse of him) and has a marvelous time rolling around in it.  Inside a good plastic chin bath house, it doesn't fly around everywhere, and it is easy to maintain and store.I cannot imagine using any other chinchilla dust.  In fact, it will never happen!;0
134891;I was looking for a less expensive alternative to Wellness Core. After doing quite a bit of research, I decided to give Hi-Tek Naturals Grain Free a try. I liked that it's protein-focused, but at the same time not ridiculously high in protein like some foods can be. I liked that the food is sourced and made in the US. (The company answered my email in under 20 minutes when I asked them about it.) I also liked that it has probiotics, and I've been able to tell from past experience that my dogs really seem to do better with foods that have probiotics as opposed to those that don't. Far fewer loose stools and upset stomachs in general. But most of all, I'm pleased that my picky dog actually likes the food. The nuggets are quite small, about the size of peas, which is fine for us but something to keep in mind if your dog likes a bigger nugget.;0
147825;I previously had another magnetic closure bait bag but would get annoyed at how it would constantly snap shut. This one is magnetic but it's a much weaker magnet. It works fabulous, but I don't get that annoying snap closure in the middle of training I got with my last bag. I love all the additional pockets that are included and the waist strap as well.;0
74601;my cat loves this.  I love it because it has a lot of gravy.  fluids are impt for cats, their diets should be 60-70% moisture;0

141344;As this is radial-shaped (i.e. round), you need a square shaped property for this to work well.  I had originally ordered this to use at the in-laws but when we got there we realized that their property is long and narrow so the dog would get shocked at the door.  However, we recently moved house and our new house in on a square lot and this wireless fence just fits in the boundaries.As with all training devices, there needs to be a period of training, association and correction.  So far, we don't have any sheds or other large obstacles or metal structures that would alter the performance of this fence.  Our dog learnt once and never got near the boundaries of the property.  We now use the collar without batteries and have had no problems as our dog does not go within 3 feet of the property line.This wireless fence has a choice of settings and we used the incremental increase setting which our dog turned-out not to need.  There is a more brutal setting which is a single large shock but we felt that our dog did not need that nor did we feel comfortable using that particular setting.Recommended only if you have a square lot, no metal structures and no large structures outside of your house that would alter/disrupt the signals.;0
114151;Milk Bones have always been my dog's favorite hard treat and now they have additional ingredients which makes them even better for him then before. Yes, I would recommend them to a dog owner, especially an owner who has a senior dog who needs these additional ingredients. And the 4 pack is great since they are only 20 oz boxes. Very well priced also.;0
31374;This toy ended up being bigger than anticipated.  If the seller would tell how big 'medium' or 'small' is, it would have been easier to have known how to buy.  Both my little guys don't play with it because it is a very heavy ball, it really 'thuds' if it hits the floor.  It is tough, well made, and loved that it was made in the USA.  I'm sure it would last a long time if it had been about half the diameter that it is.;0
89565;I have one of these for my big dog and my little dog.  Works great, definitely calms them and keeps them happy.  My big dog actually asks to have her's put on.;0

134810;The best by far in sofa throws/covers. Don't buy the less expensive ones, it may be tempting but you'll regret it. The minute you open these deluxe covers you will see the difference in quality. I bought them for my 2 living room leather loveseats due to the fact that I have an 8 month old puppy in the house. I also have 3 cats and they occasionally want to sit on the sofas too! I've been using color coordinated throws that I've tucked in and around the cushions which worked pretty well except they didn't cover the arms of the sofas or the seat backs. For those people who felt the covers slid around on leather, that may be but for the heck of it I kept the existing tucked in throw in place and put the covers over them. I tucked in between the seat and back, the sides fell perfectly over the arms and I tucked them into place too. To keep the front looking good, I tucked what was left on the sides into the side of the seat cushion. They may need fixing after a person or a rambunctious puppy sits on it but in the long run I know the covers will protect more of the sofa than the throws I used. Very very happy, don't hesitate to buy these they are fantastic.;0
15188;I bought a few teething toys, and I guess my maltipoo just doesn't like the ones that have ridges and such on them.  She likes the flat ones with not a lot of bumps on them and I think this one was softer plastic than the other ones. She chewed this one to death.  She's not an aggressive chewer so it lasted a few months, but I would definitely NOT recommend this to anyone that's got a big time chewer, because this won't last a day for you.Also - just a friendly reminder - watch your dog chewing on this - the plastic pieces do eventually fall off as they chew through the toy.  Mine clearly doesn't like them after she chews on them because I just find pieces after she chews on them, but I know some dogs love just swallowing it.;0
155135;I know its responsible to get your dog neutered but I have to think it was particularly tough on my little man. Changing his vet supplied cone with this soft oneComfy Cone Pet E-Collar, Xlarge, Blackhelped a lot but between the cone and the surgery he seemed fairly bummed. When I saw these were available I got them knowing that a good treat always cheers him up and that he would get something special during his recovery. I'm not giving these treats credit for him recovering physically but they did help his mood during a very difficult time.Now onto the treats. I don't want to sound gross but these might be the first dog treats I've used that smell like real food. They make me think of a very thin and very dry chicken tender from McDonalds. They aren't fried but they  look it. There's no comparison with other chicken jerky type treats I've had as far as look and smell. Plus they are Made In The USA which I require for all treats now.Overall these are great treats. I went through the tub in the time it took for him to recover but as a once a day treat they would last a while. I will end up getting more of these at some point after he eats his way through all he other treats I already have!;0
339;This little beaver is really more on a par size-wise with the kong &#34,extra small&#34, dog toys than their &#34,small&#34, toys. The body of the toy is only a couple inches long plus an additional couple inches for the unstuffed tail. It's great for small breeds, like shih tzus but I would hesitate to give this little thing to bigger dogs as I would be afraid they could shallow it. Just like with other Kong toys, the back is sealed with Velcro to replace the squeaker if need be and an extra squeaker is included. All in all it's a good toy and my dog does play with it (although it's definitely not on her short list of favorites) but be prepared that this is a tiny tiny toy.Just a note - the pictures show two different toys. I received the one with the dark, flat tail not the one with the fluffy lighter tail. I can't imagine that matters to anyone all that much but I just wanted to let you know which one I received.;0
51585;This is a popular ball with my Westie and with other bigger dogs at the dog park.  It's nice and squeaky.;0
60289;Ordered these for our drink well for when the filter needs to be replaced the cats love the drink well.;0
2340;My older cat has eaten this chicken and herring recipe in several can sizes.  Until recently, they have all been the same.  Lately, there is liquid (water?) floating all through the food.  If you hadn't asked, I would have waited a bit longer to mention this.The delivery is on schedule, or sometimes a bit ahead of promised date.  I am overall satisfied with the product.  We'll see if the runny consistency is typical.  If not, I will edit this review.UPDATE: 6/1/14.  I can't delay to see what is in the 2nd flat.  I have finally decided that, after cleaning up cat vomit time and again, I am donating a flat and a half of this chicken and Herring recipe in the big can to a rescue shelter.  Poor kitties--hope they can tolerate it.Also, I have decided not to buy pet food from Amazon because, if it is unsatisfactory, it is too troublesome to return it.  I have run into bent cans and in this batch, watery and apparently not acceptable taste.  One cat consistently threw it up and the younger one rejected it..;0
73535;She has been having hip problems so i thought i would try these for the price and she loves them and it got alot of 5 star reviews!!! will be buying more!;0
60988;I bought my own diffuser set a few weeks ago and I love it!  I bought this set for my sister who has two cats that don't exactly get along well.  The female cat will hiss and growl at the male cat and if they are in the same room.  My sister has had the cats for a couple of years and she has tried numerous things to see if they could get along better, but that hasn't happened.I bought her the Feliway to see if the tension between the cats would ease and after a couple of days of being plugged in, there is harmony in the household again!  The cats no longer hiss at one another and can be in the same room without any tension.  In fact, one cat will be on my sister's lap and the other on my brother in law's lap and they are all sitting on the same couch!Feliway is absolutely amazing and really works.;0
28468;The catnip drives the kitties crazier than usual.  Put on your leather gloves and try and get it away from them.;0
38689;They smelled like a cow poop. My dogs did like them though. They were bery large and hard to break apart. I wouldn'y buy again due to the smell and size.;0
144866;From the moment that my cats saw a running faucet and probably thought &#34,what is this mysterious clear, odorless, running liquid&#34, and couldn't get enough of it, I knew that I had to get a drinking water fountain. I originally bought one of those plastic water fountains and noticed that it constantly got dirty, was hard to clean, the pump/motor would get clogged or die. After going through a few of those, I decided to get a better replacement. Upon searching I noticed that cat owners were describing UTIs and chin rashes on their cats when using the plastic ones. This is when I decided to go for a metal one. While there are quite a few out there and I tried two of them, this one by Pioneer Pet is by far the best one that I found to satisfy both my cats needs, and health as well as my maintainence of the unit itself. The other one was just too big, and noisy.Speaking of big, I bought the 96 oz metal version as oppose to the regular 60 oz smaller one since I have 3 cats (one being a kitten). Eventually all three cats will be together and felt a bigger basin for water would be best.The unit arrived very well packaged, and the instructions were simple. Although it is the 96 oz version, it really did not look that big (compared to the Drinkwell and all the other plastic ones before it).It is not all metal though. The pump and filter housing is made of plastic but is basically underneath the top metal lid so it doesn't contact the cats drinking from the fountain.Cleaning the unit couldn't be easier. There are 6 pieces (top and bottom metal basin and cover), top and bottom plastic container that holds the pump and filter. The plastic pump container snaps apart easily and the tiny pump can be easily dismantled to cleaning. There is a youtube video showcasing how to take it apart to clean, just google &#34,Pioneer Pet Raindrop Fountain Pump Maintenance 101&#34,.The filter can be easily replaced by buying another one or splitting it apart and buying similar charcoal. So far since getting this last month, I've cleaned the pump about every 4 days for the first 2 weeks and weekly thereafter.Again, can't stress this enough, the pump is easy to clean. It is also not that loud, sort of a hum. It doesn't bother me since I need sound to sleep anyway (air conditioner in the summer) and this motor puts me to sleep too. lolThe cord is hidden and set in a way that the cats won't think its a play string. It is also long enough to reach a power outlet.The water that comes out of the top is more like a small bubbly at the highest setting and comes out in such a way that it doesn't spill anywhere.The motor will stop working if there isn't enough water in the basin. It looks like I refill (or add water) to the basin almost every day or every other day but that could be because I have 2 cats using it.I pretreated the unit by first placing the filter under running water for a few minutes. then placing the filter in a bowl for an hour. Then putting th unit together and let it run for an hour, replace teh water, and do this about three times before actually letting the cats start drinking from it.The cats were used to the older plastic one and the male cat took a bit longer (about an hour) to get to it, the female cat immediately took to it. male cat loves the pond like basin, the female likes the fountain bubbly part (now watch the kitten like the river portion of it).I'm truly satisfied with it and my cats drink more water too.;0
94747;Fits well, rugged construction, good materials. Coming up on 2 years and going strong - that's saying something for a critter vest. Absolutely recommended, well worth the asking price;0
3123;Bought this to test the water in my marine aquarium. It's way off! Said the specific gravity was 1.022 when it was actually a extreme low 1.015. Lucky for me it's a new set up and no fish yet or else I'd be out a lot more money for sure. And yes I rinsed very well before and after use.;0
33512;This is the BEST cat litter I have ever used!  There is no waste, no smell and NO DUST!!  Which means no more tracking and messes to clean up after the cats leave the box.  I can not believe the waste that came with the other leading brands that I have used in the past.  A MUST TRY!!  After you do once you will never go back to any other cat litter!!;0
141423;I have a doxie who needs to lose a little weight...this is a good quality dog food that is lower in calories.Her vet said no grains...this is grain free.  She gobbles this food down so I will give it 5 stars!;0
130010;"This item seems like a great idea...a convenient, and non-messy way to carry treats for the dog.  It is like a roll-on deodorant container...a bottle of fluid with a rolling ball top that brings the fluid up to the top of the ball as it is spun.  It has a rich, bacon smell smell to it and my little dog (7 lb. Maltese) was interested in it, but I couldn't get him to lick it beyond the first tentative taste.  I think that it was the novel delivery that threw him off, not the taste.  I believe that with a larger dog, where one tongue swipe would clear off and refresh the ball, it might be better received.I'm back after trying this with a larger dog with no success.  He just wanted to take the whole thing in his mouth.This seems like a good idea and it might work if you started using it with a puppy as a training device.  Perhaps you could ""train"" older dogs to use it properly, but it is certainly NOT worth the effort to do that.";0
24755;I thought this will be useful to keep the tooth of my cats in good shape, but just 1 of 10 cats like to chew them, the rest don't care about this product. (I have a shelter of cats);0
111745;She wont even eat her fancy feast anymore, now its Natural Balance and Wellness! Before she couldnt go a day without her fancy feast, now she turns her nose up at it. Spoiled brat!!!Above is my old review, below is my new review.I am currently feeding my cat natural balance and another brand. my cat can be picky, she rejected one flavor from the other brand, she would spend hours crying to not eat it.this one she liked, in the beginning. BUT these past few weeks, she just does not want to eat this flavor, out of all her flavors it is the only one she whines about. she will cry and cry until i change it. i give her from her other options and she is fine, this is the only one she rejects.i gave three stars, as my cat likes other flavors from this brand.;0
52762;I'm sure the dog would prefer I just never give her a bath but this stuff works great. She smelled clean and it looks like it will last quite a few baths, which is nice.;0
90686;I thought it looked ok, with big chunks of real fish... but for some reason, the kitties both hated it, despite their love for fish. I managed to not let it go to waste by mixing 1/4 can into each of their bowls of other canned food. Maybe they just don't like sardines? Nothing wrong with it, cats just didn't like this flavor. :-);0
78460;"We bought this because our little kitty broke her hind leg and needed a protected area while healing. We have a large plastic kennel but as she healed wanted a place that she could move and exercise to build her strength back up. This was perfect. When she was not in the plastic kennel for the night she could be under our watchful eye in the living room in the Soft Side Play Yard. As it seems the only negative I have seen is regarding the bottom panel being held in place by velcro tabs, never once did she try to escape by pulling up the floor.Soon after the female kitty was well enough to be independent again, her male brother was neutered and again we needed a place of calm, peace and seclusion for him. Once again the Soft Side Play Yard came in handy.It is nice to know that when we don't need an enclosure, it folds and fits into a very small carry case (about the size of a laptop computer).This is a very well made product, with very high quality construction, and worth the price. The ""small"" size I purchased fits nicely under my desk so kitties can have company during the day, and in other places like the bedroom for comfort at night.";0
56117;The dead mouse in the walls test. That's what I bought it for and it works. I know it does because I put it where the smell was the strongest and came back later and the smell was gone, but when I moved the Odor Genie away from that spot the odor came back. I'm going to buy a few more.;0
8909;My dog is a heavy chewer and usually starts destroying rope toys in minutes, but this one seems to be holding up pretty well.;0
93487;It is not to heavy, they both can fit in it for now and I love the side pocket. I also like the easy carrying, a good buy;0
108358;Finally a wet food that my cat is willing to eat when he feels like it.  No fault of the product.  My little guy just likes crunch.  He will always lick the broth of all the Tikis but he'll only eat the solids of this one.  I do have a bit more success mixing in a little of his dry Instinct Duck although he has been known to pick out the dry bits.  The things our cats have trained us to put up with, I swear.;0
126280;Taught my black barking pug to stop barking and scares the crap out of her and all the other animals. I don't even have to spray it anymore. Just show it to them and they all dash :) Worth every penny!;0
20612;My dogs love this octopus toy!  I bought one for each of them.  It's pretty durable and the little dogs love all the legs.  This is literally fun for them for hours, and my Brandy even sleeps with hers!  I would recommend this toy for medium to smaller dogs.;0
48940;I have no idea what goes into these things, but to my dogs they act as if it is heroin. They live for these things.I have a small dog, and a medium sized dog, and feed them both these teenies.For the small dog, that works - but for the medium dog, I think he really should have larger ones.When he was getting larger ones, they actually made his breath less horrendous, but these little ones seem to do nothing for his breath - but he still loves them.;0
66977;I have this in medical ear irrigation unit mixed with warm sterile water to clean my dogs' ears. Work very, very well.Be careful to use ONLY with sterile or distilled water. Tap water will introduce particulate matter and bacteria that you do not want in your or your pets' ears.;0
46266;Don't ask me why but this product does a better job at mellowing out my cats then the feliway pheromones. Even though they are both by comfort zone the feliway product actually makes me cats more grouchy. The comfort zone product is much better and my cats have a much more preferred reaction to it.;0
20661;It is so cute that I'm sure little Jasper will love it.  Bright color and seems very well made.  It's in his stocking now for Christmas surprise.;0
83377;Dachshund puppy is not interested in this toy. It smells like rubber and no matter what I stuff it with or rub it in, it still smells like rubber.;0
42962;This is my dog's favorite treat.  He doesn't care for the Dingo bones.  Dingo balls are hard to find in Hawaii, well, at the stores that I go to, so, it's great that I can get them through Amazon.com.  Delivery is very fast!;0
73969;Two of the three cats really love it.  The dog chases them in there.  Apparently its a lot of fun.;0
81658;It's OKAY - love the idea behind the toy, but it's a little akward to put together for me, and easy to take apart my my cockatoo.It's work outs fine with my larger conure - but she's not too interested in it.;0
125100;I use this product as one of my dogs has a food allergy and only eats venison.  It's great that there are natural products available to give as a treat instead of dog treats loaded with artificial junk.;0
11315;I read the great reviews and had to see for myself.  I used this on my lab pit who always runs when I brush him.  Well I started brushing him and as usually he quickly walked away, but wait, he looked back at me and came back to be brushed again.  Then he left and came back over and over.  It removes hair and he sheds less too!;0
130900;My 6 month old cat refuses to eat any of these. I don't know if it's the taste, or the texture. All the cans are just mush with no chunks or anything at all, and my cat doesn't seem to like that.;0
120248;I am happy with the ingredients of this product, manufactured in USA (don't get me started on what other brands that are made in US are actually made of though)The cats like it - apparently tastes good and they like the small kibble.Happy cats = happy mamma;0
119544;We have two rescued pit mixes who are a a year old and a 15 week old APBT. They have made short work destroying two remotes, countless cardboard boxes, dozens of squeaky toys and nylabones and any stray paper, pens, etc. they can sink their teeth into.  We went in search of the truly takes-forever-to-gnaw-away- chew toy and discovered antlers. Previously, we bought from a local pet supply store, but on a whim, we ordered two gigantic antlers. They cost twice as much, but I kid you not they are at least 4 times the size of what we were buying. One is close to the size of our 15 week old puppy! I don't think we will be buying locally anymore!;0
14538;Let's face it--picking up after the dog is not fun.  It's even less fun with a cheap plastic rake, or using the old hand-in-the-plastic-bag trick.  I have been looking everywhere for a wire rake pooper scooper.  I had purchased something similar years ago, and it is just now starting to show its age, so time to be replaced.  This one is even better than the one I had:  it appears to be sturdier, with heavier gauge tines, and the metal is coated so it won't rust.  I also like the plastic cover on the metal handle.  I find it works best if you hold it so that the tines are pointing towards you.  No mess, and you don't have to get anywhere near the smelly dog bombs!;0
116509;Not sure who likes it more, the dog or the kids.  Holding up over a week and for this dog that is good sign.  No marks on it yet and he sure has tried.;0
59737;I ordered the large size for two dwarf bunnies I was picking up from a shelter. I didn't know that bonded bunnies should travel together and unfortunately, two dwarfs would not fit in there comfortably and still have room to move. However, it's a perfect size for one dwarf. For reference, my bunnies are 2 and 3 lbs.Hope they create larger carriers that are just as cute. I don't like the big hefty dog carriers, this carrier will not cut you like those carriers and is much easier to handle.;0
137966;I love that it's grain free, and we have never experienced skin or stomach issues with our cat since switching to Halo Grain-Free Hearty Chicken.;0
13962;My dog is a 9 months old 60 pound boxer and he is a big chewer. We give him antlers, buffalo horns and stuff and they last him about a week to 10 days. Thought I will try this based on the numerous good reviews it has. My dog never liked it. He chewed it for like 10 mins and just rejected it and never tried it again. The problem I think in our case is, this bone is a big piece of plastic and does not ooze out any juice upon chewing. So if your dog is used to chewing traditional bones, do not buy this product. Bottom line is buy this product in the pet store for the first time where return is always hassle free if you dog doesn't like it. Buying online and return is a pain now. Now all I have is an expensive piece of plastic laying in my backyard.;0
50217;Our dogs really liked these at first.  It does keep them occupied, but as opposed to other &#34,puzzle&#34, or &#34,busy&#34, bones, this one is pretty easy to master and I think they got bored with it.  High quality material and they love eating the discs (rawhide);0
19048;This  Omega Paw  self cleaning litter box  is NOT sturdy!  The parts that snap together do NOT fit, and  if they fit  would be very easily to break off.  and  to operate the box, you have to turn it...  and it just is NOT a good product!;0
65782;I've been through many kitty water fountains (I've had 4 indoor cats for 8 years now). Every last one has always gotten clogged with hair, motor burns out, or some other issue. I know it's bound to happen (I mean, come on, these fountains work 24/7), but so far this is the longest I've ever had a fountain last! I love that the cats enjoy drinking out of it, it's a pretty low maintenance fountain (easy to clean, easy to change filters on), and the filters aren't a million dollars. Additionally, the filters don't need to be changed as often as my previous fountains' did.;0
69208;I've had this filter for a month and it does an amazing job! I have a 5-gallon tank with an African Dwarf frog and a mystery snail in it. The filter is being used with the spray bar fitted just above water level, I have positioned it so that the waterfall makes absolutely no noise and you can often see Slowly, our snail, climbing right under the water to twist and turn in it as if he is taking a shower. The filter itself is well made, the only comment I would have is that its casing is no longer made transparent, it is now black. The water is clear and all the readings from it make me happy. I do a partial water change once every two weeks and that seems to keep everyone alive and well.Cannot say enough good things about the filter's sleek design as well. My tank is square and it fits nicely into a corner. Sometimes my frog will climb up to the surface and hang on to it while it sleeps, but it has never gotten stuck and the filter is built in such a way that I don't even worry about it.;0
100728;"Briley cannot get enough of her "" Banana Chicken "" ( name reversed in my household merely for amusement ) - Briley is conspiring new ways to get another treat out of that bag of pure nirvana. She is somewhat of a picky eater but she would devour all of the contents at once if we let her. I would not eat this myself but to be honest, it SMELLS like a snack food that humans COULD eat. You cannot say THAT about every dog treat on the market! Healthy, Affordable and an A+ from Briley Victoria who certainly gives the Vitalife Chicken and Banana Recipe Wraps a 2 PAWS UP!";0
56856;I thought these were going to be a gimmick but they work really well. We tried all the home based wraps such as peanut butter and hotdogs on our Beagle but she almost always found the hard pill and spit it out. I had taken to putting the pill at the back of her mouth and holding her chin up for pilling. Then my wife decided to try this and sure enough it worked like a champ every time.;0
12061;Had high hopes that this comb's blades were sharp. Not. At. All. It had the sticking quality reminiscent of a tin can lid being dragged through my dog's hair. Definitely not sharp enough to cut without discomfort. My dog doesn't even have heavy matts and this comb couldn't slide through her hair. Soooooooo dissappointed.;0
22881;I use catnip to coat the scratching post for my indoor cats.  I feed two strays on my front porch.  I used the catnip to train them to go into a dog house that I put out there for winter that was loaded with blankets and sweaters.  I sprinkled it on a path leading to the dog house and also on top of the blankets.;0
24354;If you have a cat that likes to dig and get litter everywhere, this may really help!It really  is great for keeping the litter inside. However, a few of my cats wont go in it with the cover on ( could be because they are a little chubby and it's too cramped for them...?) otherwise, it's a good size and it's also helped keep my fox terrier from poking around in the litter!;0
150201;Great deal, good quality, still using months (and months) later. I would definitely recommend buying online in bulk instead of the expensive in store purchases.;0
113677;It's the best food my cat has loved for a long time, there's nothing left after I put it down and she craves it, I've a very happy cat!;0
32648;This is a very solid leash hook that was exactly what I needed. The black finish on the metal frame looks good too.;0

93500;This carrier fit well for my three pound  puppy, she only whimpered a little bit, with the mesh windows I was able assure her that I was there.  There is a hole where the zipper meets the sides of the carrier, my puppy was able to squeeze her head through it.  I will hand stitch this area closed, that is the only reason I  rated it with four stars instead of five.The carrier has a zippered area the length of the carrier in the back, I can easily fit in a large wallet, keys, and misc. in which it makes it very handy carrier.  We went to five different stores and not one person noticed that there was a dog in it!  Very discreet carrier.;0
53781;I have a large dog & a very furry cat that use a water fountain. My cat likes to play with the fountain more than drink & leaves all her fur in the fountain for the filters to trap.  Needless to say I got through filters quicker than I'd like. So when I came across these on amazon I was thrilled to find such a great price.  Trust me this is an amazing deal for a great product!;0
63648;My active, adolescent cat loves this toy. However, its annoyingly loud (I think for both of us). I may have a broken one (it works fine, bu who knows whats inside), but the motion comes with lots of cranking, etc. However, you cant argue with an entertained cat.;0
46637;This is a much better place for Harriet to play while I clean her condo.  She has a ball, but it gets caught under furniture and there have been times when I've lost her and it was hard to find her.  I love the mat, and the playpen is also where I give her the bath.  She runs around it and I know she's having a great time.;0
38048;My Standard Poodle could only have tennis balls for brief periods and then I'd have to pick up the ball, because he would chew off pieces that I certainly did not want him to swallow. I saw that the company rated this ball a 5 out of 5 on toughness for chewing and bought one. He loved it, and it held up. So I bought him 4 more. So far no damage to any of them, and they have been greatly loved.I do have to keep hunting them up, because they wind up in the strangest places! But that's just because he so loves to play with them. Dogs can learn to chew things up that they haven't destroyed before, so I will be ever vigilant. But so far, I am thrilled with this toy.I also have a thing I do with tennis balls where I put a piece of braided nylon rope through it (involves a bent coat hanger and a utility knife), for a training toy. Looking at this ball, I see two holes and a hollow ball, meaning it is not too heavy for a dog to catch in his mouth, and I can put the rope through, tie knots to hold it, and voila!!!I really like this toy! THANK YOU, Planet Dog, for coming out with it!;0
96620;Cat rating 3 or 4, my rating 5 for the quality.  I may try a different flavor next time.  They will eat this, but didn't love it.;0
98957;The shampoo is very thin and watery,but the end results are great,and the scent is one of the best I have smelled,so all in all,i really like it! The price is great for such a large bottle and lasts a long time!;0
65515;This may seem a bit expensive for a wooden stick that has an apple in the middle of it, but for the most part I thought it was good. It (the apple) lasted a good 1.5 - 2 weeks and it's true that it's healthy for rabbits, but the only bad thing is that my bunny (dwarf bun-bun ^^) didn't seem to want to chew on the stick itself after the apple was gone. There are maybe like...2 minute bite marks on it but hey, maybe it's just my bunny? :P I'm still keeping it in the stick but for 4 bucks, I personally think its worth a try :);0
31086;Nothing what so ever to complain abut with this order.The leash is a BRIGHT red and great quality nylon with a leather stopper.Super hand to just throw over chest while walking dogs and is very effective.;0

151867;As I waited for this to arrive, I was thinking about giving this a negative review.  I went out on day 11 and bought one locally thinking I would just return the amazon one, but I kept the amazon one for the following reasons.- The engraving on the amazon one fits a lot better.  It goes out further, and you can control the capitals so it's just a better engraving for a long address.-It's a lot easier to see.  The silver on black is very recognizable and it's a nice font, the one from the pet store was indented silver on silver which is fine, but not easy to see.-It looks sleek, (I really like the look with a black nose) and is very sturdy.  Of course the first thing I did when I got it was try to scratch the letters off and bend the name tag to see what type of punishment it could take.  I was pleasantly surprised, I expect this to last longer than I will need it.SummaryIn the end, I was frustrated that it took so long to get, but it's a much better product than I can get at the pet store and it's less than half the price.  Will purchase again, already recommended to a friend.;0
84564;No matter how many times I washed my pup's bedding, she'd still pee on it. Someone then told me about this laundry boost product. It evens out the odors that we can't smell, but our dogs can. She hasn't had an accident since!;0
29906;Cute toy.Not doing this any more as what can you say about a puppytoy.The stars should be enough!!;0
151970;I ordered the black bone for my puppy and it looks perfect - exactly what I wanted! The laser engraving is very clear and easy to read and the shipping was incredibly fast. The being so low is just a bonus. I'm considering getting new tags for my cats now :);0
103638;I purchased these pet stairs to allow my 3-legged cat to get up on my bed.  The stairs are easy for him to use, plus, they were very easy to assemble, are made of decent materials, and are very sturdy.  I imagine that the screws may loosen up over time, but tightening them is very simple.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with cats or smaller dogs that are older or amputees.;0
131101;I like this Bin. It holds alot of food, an okay amount of hay. Looks very durable,easy to refill, doesn't take up too much space, looks nice, will take some serious effort for my guinea pig to get droppings and bedding mixed in with his food and/or chew it apart.FEEL FREE TO SKIP THE NEXT FEW PARAGRAPHSSo recently my guinea pig, Kasper, has been tipping over his food bowl several times a day. My solution, push the bowl into bedding to keep it secure. It didnt tip over but Kasper walked all over his food, and tracked bedding in it.Another on going problem is that he would contantly tip over his other bowl for hay and he would run around and kick it out of his cage. There my pup would find it on the floor and attempt to eat it but he would start gaging instead.I tried using a wooden feeder on the inside of the cage.Super Pet Natural Large Hay MangerIt didn't work, he had trouble getting the hay out and basically ate the wood instead. Tried a plastic feeder on the outside of the cageLixit SLX0169 Hayrack...75% of hay would fall on the ground, 20% would be pulled out by Kasper and fall on the bedding... leaving a small percentage to eat. I tried the rolling ball thingSuper Pet Rabbit Rollin' The Hay Holder, the lock wouldn't close, and broke in a week.;0
2793;Our puppy chewed right through the tabs on the sides of the bowls in less than a month.  Maybe ok for an older dog, but not a chewer.;0
91560;MY CATS GO WILD FOR THIS!!! THE CHICKEN AND GRAVY IS SO GOOD I'VE ALMOST BEEN TEMPTED TO TASTE IT..;0
56556;This is an excellent pet carrier. I can carry more than one cat in it to the vet and receive a multiple pet discount. The top doesn't leak, so I remove the gates and use it to feed outdoor cats. This is a safe method to prevent any TomCat fights and helps feed stray and feral cats.;0
136153;first I bought the brown version of these mats and was quickly amazed as to just how much water and debris they pick up.  Then I noticed that my dog kept lying on the mat and using it as a bed so I purchased a 2nd one to use as her &#34,travel Bed&#34,  Now whenever we are away from home I have a nice soft place for her to lie as well as collecting any dirt.;0
34356;Glows in the dark, reflective and good quality. Gave it 4 stars because my cat's long hair covers most of the collar. Wished the collar could be more thicker.;0
4762;I use this for a bath for new additions to the tank. They get a five minute bath, then acclimate. The bottle I received a bottle well packed and sealed with tape. I received it quickly as well. The bottle was fresh and with a long expiration date. It came in the new packaging. A few drops in the bag, and bye bye nasty. Great for highlighting Ick on a fish that it is hard to see.;0
58212;The product did not work at all.  Seizures persisted and did not even lessen.  I went through half the bottle and then went to the vet.  She needed more water under her skin injected more often, to dilute and wash out her wastes, toxins (kidney failure).  She's almost 22 now. She also needed FortiFlora to destroy the bad bacteria in her colon.  That worked like magic.  No more smell.  We brought her back from her deathbed literally.  I give her 200 ml of water every other day and it was my husband who bought FortiFlora for her.  EaseSure might work for other problems, but not for my cat's kidney failure and toxic colon.  I believe the reason for the kidney failure was too much bad bacteria and it destroyed her kidneys.  Wish I knew earlier.  Her breath smelled for two or three years and the vet didn't address the issue at all. Again, Chiropractors come out way ahead of MDs and Vets who cover up with drugs or cut it out - that's basically all they do, and the Chiropractors and Naturepaths get at the root of the problem and fix it.  I probably said too much.  But it is so true.  I'd rather fix her from the inside, introduce more good bacteria to eat the bad and get the water she needs to flush the toxins.  After months of seizures, each one taking more of a toll to the point of almost no return, she is seizure free with the water under her skin and FortiFlora on a regular basis.;0
100264;Dog Loves these vitamins I got some other kind and he wouldn't eat them. These are like TREATS for him he looks forward to getting them and I think they help him feel a little better too (as he is a senior)Overall very happy with the price and they way the dog likes them;0
129081;My dog got this and practically as I was pulling it out of the box she was very interested...but, as usual, it was an absolute waste of my time and money..without a doubt!;0
130652;Not a bad one in the bunch well built I am very happy with the purchase I greatly recommend these.;0
22129;I have 4 cats and sometimes they go when they should not.... I LOVE this stuff.  Great for fur ball upchucks - anything that can come out of them!!  I also have used it when I upset a plate of spaghetti on the new light grey carpet - worked FABULOUSLY!!;0
2783;This dish is too deep for cats but what really annoyed me was the 45 minutes I spent trying to get the label off. I tried peeling it off, using soap and water, then Goo-gone, and then Goof-off. I scraped and rubbed and there is still a ton of adhesive stuck to the side of the frame. Now there's cat hair stuck to the adhesive. Lastly, when you lift the feeder up you have to make sure you hold it by the frame, otherwise the bowls pop out onto the floor. I threw it in the trash after about a week.;0
47192;This is a great product, well made, good size, exactly as pictured. Purchased this for my boyfriends dachshund that is quite old and she loved it! She always chooses this bed over the others, so precious :);0
129536;Our Maine Coon loves the variety of balls that came with this bag and switches between almost all of them regularly.  They are a really great size too - smaller than some of the other balls we have purchased.  He loves that he can pick these up and carry them around in his mouth.His favorite is the mylar crinkle ball - one warning about those if they get in the water bowl (or wet at all) the dye will run everywhere and if they get in the water bowl he will no longer drink from it.  We make sure not to leave this ball out if we will be gone for a while.  This seems to be the case with all mylar crinkle balls we have tried so far.;0
117849;I bought these with the hope that they would outlast what I can get at the local pet store. While the dog seemed to like the treat, she wore it to a nub in just a few hours. Elk antlers far outlasted this. To be fair, you really can't put a time to live on such an item. It looks like I will be heading back to the elk antlers to keep Fido occupied.;0
157504;Not very exciting when they work.  Nasty when they don't.  So far have been through 6 rolls and have never had a single problem with the bag tearing and causing an issue.  Not crazy about the smell of the bag but it beats what the load would otherwise smell like.  Will definitely purchase more when this supply is gone.;0
19360;Nothing special here, these are no sharper than my old clipper (9 year old clipper!) in a pinch they work but was hoping for something sharper to make the process a bit faster and easier on my doggies. They are for sure for large breed dogs.;0
95598;"A few months ago, I bought a Scoop-free automatic litter box to replace one of two regular litter boxes.  Initially, I used the litter cartridges that came with the box.  The litter smell in the house decreased immediately. Previously, when I used regular clumping litter, it left a noticeable litter odor in the house. So I purchased the re-useable ""Forever Tray"" and the ""Just the Crystals"" from Amazon to avoid the expense of buying new pre-filled cartridges.  I use the crystals both in the new Scoop-free automatic litter box and the regular litter box.  I add a little extra when I stir & scoop out the dehydrated feces once or twice a week.  I throw out the old litter once a month and hose out the boxes. The smell in the house is gone even after moving both litter boxes to another room near the living room. Keeping this litter in a dry place allows it to better absorb moisture from cat urine and feces.  I will buy a 2nd Scoop-free automatic box because my 3 cats use it. ""Just the Crystals Premium Cat Litter"" is a great choice for my 3 cats and me (and my nose).PROS:Grocery store scoop litter costs: $11.99 for box.  3 cats used box & 1/2 per month.  Cost $17.99Just the Crystals costs: $17.89Store scoop litter smelled even when scooped every other day.Just the Crystals took out the odor, even when used in regular litter box.Using litter from store meant more trips to various stores to buy cat litter.Delivery of Just the Crystals via Amazon lowers the amount of trips to grocery store.CONS:There is a bit of the larger crystals scattered, but using a microfiber dust mop easily clears floor.";0
112382;This dog food was very good and full of real meat and other healthy ingredients. I recommend it and our dog loves it.;0
16185;I have used this on everything from furniture to the fence in my backyard. My dog has been mouthy since a pup, and this spray has been well worth it for the household items it has saved from his destruction;0
152821;Neither of my dogs are that picky of eaters though the older Chihuahua has hard time eating harder, bigger treats.  Thankfully, these are nice, small, and very chewable and a full bag that will last a while.  It is just a bonus that that are healthy with a hickory bacon smell that almost make my mouth water.;0
13391;it states colors are assorted, I received a beige one , is a good litter box for the money, comparable at Wal-....  is $19 plus tax, would order again;0
48080;"We got our 2 cats (a senior female, and an adult female) this for Christmas this year, and it is the best toy we have ever gotten them. Our normally aloof senior cat can hardly leave it alone - she plays with it for 30-60 minutes several times a day. They both love the scratcher in the middle, but can't seem to get enough of batting the ball around the track. As a bonus, our two huge dogs don't chew this up like they do catnip toys, and it also keeps our senior cat busy so she doesn't terrorize the dogs - which used to be her main hobby, until we got this. So the dogs are pretty happy about it, too. The one tiny downside is that she loves it so much, we sometimes wake up in the middle of the night thinking ""What is that NOISE?"" - and it's just the cat toy.";0
55972;My dogs love these and the pig skin is easier on their systems than the bleached rawhide. I would get these again - the price is really good.;0
56159;I saw a noticeable improvement in dental health after giving my dogs this product for ~2 months. It will not make your dogs teeth perfect and sparkling clean, but it DID dramatically reduce the accumulation of tartar for all my dogs (and even made it easier to chip away build up). I still brush teeth and use tartar liquid in their water, plaqueOff isn't a substitute for brushing your dog's teeth, but it will definitely help keep them clean.;0
135733;We recently got a Mini Aussie puppy and I was determined to not feed the Science Diet my pets had been eating for years now.  My vet had recommended the aforementioned kibble and I was horrified when I actually took the time to read the ingredients.  Shame on me for not looking at them before now, but I suppose it is better late than never. I started to research the best dog foods available and this one came up on several different lists.  I tried Wellness and neither my Pug or the puppy would touch it, this food however, has been a winner.  It provides a grain free, nutritious meal for my puppy and he loves it as well.;0
38434;Our pup LOVES this Frisbee so much we bought him 2.  Murphy is a chewer too, and this toy has held up the longest of all of the toys we've purchased for him.  He will go through an average toy in about 2-4 weeks before completely mutilating it, I think he thinks it is a game...  He could spend hours outside retrieving this frisbee, and when we aren't playing fetch, he just chews and tugs on it for fun.  VERY durable.  LOVE this product!!;0
2776;This chew toy is a good texture for my dog- not too hard so that I am afraid of him breaking his teeth but not so soft that he is chewing pieces off. My dog is a very strong chewer and he has not, as of yet, taken chunks out of this toy. I have not yet left him alone with it, though, as I have read other reviews which say strong chewers can take this toy apart. The main downside is this toy only moderately holds my dog's interest. He was pretty excited about it the day I got it, but since then his interest slowly declined and now he hardly looks at it.;0
134830;I have this seat covering the back seat of my 2014 Mazda6, and I am definitely pleased with how it fits.  Obviously the manufacturer is trying to get the cover to fit as many vehicles as possible, so it's by no means a perfect fit.  However, I do believe that this cover is significantly better than any of the hammock style seat covers - especially for larger dogs.One of the consistent complaints I read about the cover was that it would shift when a larger dog would get into the car.  I found this to be the case as well, but usually I'm able to give it a quick tug and get it back into place after my dog gets in the car.  It's a 2-second adjustment, and not something that I mind at all.The major plus for me, and the reason I gave it five starts, is the access points to the seat belts.  I have a six-month old that rides in a rear-facing car seat, and thanks to the access flaps I can strap in the car seat base without having to remove the cover.  This allows me to keep the cover in place all the time.  More than likely I'll keep the seat cover in place as my child gets older, and it will serve double duty by protecting my seats from the dog and from the kiddo!;0
14328;My 12 week old pup finally outgrew his travel crate and so I set this monster up.  I have to admit that it is HUGE!  I am surprised that it was so cheap compared to local pet stores and I bought it when it was on sale months ago through Amazon.  I think I bought the wrong size but I read so many reviews that this is the size to get.  I am sure my dog will never get that big. (He will be 65 lbs full grown) My pup is an indoor dog. He is outside in his covered 10 x 5 x 6 kennel when we are at work several days a week.  It doesn't get too cold here in Southern California but I guess if I had to leave him for a few hours in strange weather I could keep him in this.  I am only using it for his bedtime.  It is so big that there will be no way on this planet I will use it to travel.  It is too big and heavy for me to lift.  I may have to get a smaller airline carrier type of crate but I am not worried about that as I prefer to have one in the SUV and one to stay put in the house.  I keep it in the downstairs bedroom since it seems so massive to have in a living area to me.I set it up last night and it truly is a snap to set up for as bulky and big as it is.  I like the double doors.  I added a big towel in the smaller divided section and threw a quilt over the top to make it more like a den. My pup got in and fell right to sleep which was great.  My pup has never had an accident but even with the divider in the cage it is so tall that it would seem any dog can just squat and pee.  I had a hard time sleeping in fear that the pup would go in the crate.  But...he didn't.  :)I will have to do a follow up review after a week to let you know how it goes.;0
96613;My cats enjoy it, and my 15 year old kitty, who has digestive problems, tolerates it very well.  She's even gained a little weight!;0
156519;My name is Charlie, and I am a dog. I am the official gourmand of our dog family. I am also a very discriminating eater. My mom asked me to write this review, since I am the real expert. All I can say is, &#8220,YUMMY!&#8221, These are really good treats. They are chewy, but not tough, and the taste and smell of these treats is out-of-this-world!Mom said that I had to mention that the ingredients were very good, mostly chicken and sweet potatoes, which are good for me. I really don&#8217,t care, but she watches that stuff! She was not thrilled, however, with the sweetener and salt, but this treat is healthier than many of the treats out there. My sisters and brother loved these treats too! We begged for more, but Mom said that we could not eat the whole bag in one day. But I could! I hope Mom buys these treats, again!;0
137192;we were used to using Nature's Miracle's Advanced poop bags and they were much better. better size with deodorizer to mask stench.;0
63759;It's a really good option, to be able to replace the cutting blades of this nail trimmer with new, sharp ones. It's really important to our dog that we use a high quality, sharp nail trimmer, it's quieter, quicker, and makes neater cuts that require less nail filing. Our dog is much happier with this trimmer and its sharp blades. Home sharpening is a better option now, too, with the removable blades.;0
45746;great dish, using this one for dogs, and the other for my catsI like that it is high off the ground and it is great for easy clean up.;0
108543;At first my dogs were not quite sure what in the world this was but now they drag it all over the place. It is very long so it is kind of fun to watch them clumsily trip on it when they are dragging it..;0
62457;A great labor saving device. I got into the fish hobby a few months ago with a 10 gallon tank.  Then, I added a 40 gallon tank.  Then, I added another 40 gallon tank.  Hauling 5 gallon buckets of water was great exercise for the first two tanks.  When I got to the third, I decided it was time to look into a water changer.  I was going to try to build one myself since I already had a gravel vacuum.  I figured with a few parts from the hardware store and about 50' of tubing, I could save myself some money.  After a LOT Of searching for the right parts and tubing, I finally broke down and bought the Aqueon Changer.  Even if I could have found all the parts I needed, it was going to cost me as much or more than the Aqueon.  So, I bought it.I'm happy with the construction of the device and the adapters it came with.  It easily fits onto my bathroom sink and I can reach all three tanks with the 50' hose.  A couple of slight drawbacks are the tubing itself is very thin.  I keep mine in the garage and it's hot this time of year.  I realized when the tubing is hot it gets VERY flexible and therefore kinks easily.  A couple of times I have been draining the tank and wondering why it was going so very slowly, only to realize yet another kink had appeared in the hose, almost as if by magic.  That problem goes away as the tubing cools. The other thing is the way it's designed, you use water running from your faucet to create a siphon to pull water from your tank. If you've ever drained a waterbed, you might be familiar with this.  Well, this uses a lot of water for one thing.  And, secondly, my sink doesn't drain fast enough to handle both the water running from the tap and the water draining from the tank.  Third, I like using the waste water to water my plants rather than running it down the drain.  So, I use a method I found on YouTube for starting a gravel siphon and remove fitting from the end of the line and drain the fish tank water outside. Then, I re-attach the fitting and fill from the tap.I haven't used the competing brand of water changer. But, I'm very happy with the Aqueon.p.s.- after having owned the 50' version of this for about a year, I'd like to update my review. I keep my changer in the garage where it gets warm. The hose tends to kink because the wall are too thin. I spend 5 minutes or more each time trying to get all the kinks out of the hose and I'm afraid I'm going to spring a leak in one of those soon.  I wish the hose were thicker.p.p.s- After using the water changer for about a year and a half, finally one of small cracks that had been appearing in the hose broke all the way through.  I could not find a replacement hose anywhere.  Now, the good news. I called up Aqueon with the intention of buying a hose from them. They told me there is a lifetime warranty on the device. They not only replaced the hose, they sent a whole new water changer. You cannot beat that. I am going to store it inside now though and see if that solves the problem with the hose kinking.;0
56652;Thirsty little &#34,big&#34, towel that gets my Chi-Chi and Shitz dry much faster! I only ordered one just to try it. So now I will have to order another so they don't have to share!;0
18885;THE TOY WORKED GREAT FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES. MY DOG IS A CHEWER AND THE TOY HAS A VERY PLEASANT SMELL AND AFTER SHE GOT THE TREATS OUT OF THE TOY, SHE CHEWED IT UP. I STILL GIVE IT HIGH MARKS BECAUSE MY DOG STILL ENJOYS THE TOY VERY MUCH, EVEN THOUGH I CAN NOT PUT TREATS IN IT NOW.....;0
155934;Most litters are acceptable and this one is certainly acceptable. The ones I hate blow up a lot of dust into my face when I'm shoveling, and this doesn't, or they look unattractive because of the dark color, or other silly reasons. My cats are fine with it. They don't care for the crystal litter or the litter that looks like wood shavings. They like this.;0

119430;My Tripod is old, skinny, decrepit, and the pickiest eater alive, but she LOVES this stuff! The 3-oz size is good for her, although sometimes she's so hungry she eats 2 cans. This is unheard of in recent years!! At the moment, this flavor is out of stock, and she's losing weight. I hope the pipeline gets filled up with it soon, or Tripoddy might not be around to enjoy it. :(;0
20416;First, some background on my dog. He is a rescue dog whom I got in May 2013. After a month of having him his true nature started coming out. I found out he can be a puller and did not like other dogs. He would lunge at dogs and bicycles. I was using a regular collar on him but he would pull and would go after other dogs on walks. He also developed a habit of barking when I got to a house that he knew had a dog. So, even if other dogs were not barking at him if he remembered the house he would start barking which made it hard to walk him in the morning. My dog is 30 lbs, I am over 200 so it is not like he was stronger than me. But I knew this was a bad habit of his.I got the Easy Walk in hopes it would keep him from pulling. With the Easy Harness he did get better in not pulling as much but would still pull at times. But, it did nothing to curb his lunging at dogs and bikes. It was getting frustrating walking him as he would bark at no apparent reason. If you know how to use it, this collar can be helpful in training your dog to not pull as much. But, don't expect miracles, you still need to do your part to train your dog.Fast forward 3 months to the head halter. I heard about gentle leader but was apprehensive in getting it. In putting on the gentle leader my dog did fuss and not want it on him. He would try to take it off by pawing at it and rubbing his face on bushes. It has been 5 days and still does it but he is getting used to it. Reward him with treats after so he associates as positive. So does it work? YES! But, be sure you know how to use it. Watch the DVD! it is important you don't send your dog mixed signals by keeping it tense. On our first walk the dog did pull and lunge but he did not like the feeling, especially when lunging. But on our first walk I could tell he was staying by my side much better. I did not expect it to prevent lunging but it has. I think it makes him think twice. I have taken him past houses where dogs will bark it him, in the past he would try to go to the barking but now he just whimpers and keeps walking. This produce truly is working wonders (the gentle leader).So in short, I would recommend both the Easy Walk and Gentle Leader. If you have a problem it does not hurt to try both and see which one works better for your dog. But keep in mind you have to do your part to still train your dog. These products are meant as tools. For my purpose, Gentle Leader has done wonders.The only complaint i have on gentle leader is i wish there was padding on the part that goes over the snout. After taking it off you can see the impression it makes on his snout when removed. But not sure if padding would render this product less effective or not. But, no I do not consider this product as abusive or cruel. It is a tool to help him understand what is expected of him on walks.;0
90228;My cats love these treats and I know that they are healthy for them! There are so many kinds to choose from now. They also have the Mega size to help save money. Check them out I'm sure your kitty will love them too!;0
73437;"The first thing I do whenever I get any pet treats is checkout the back of the bag. There are a few warning signs that stand out immediately for me about this product:1 - Ingredients are all grain or additives. Zero meat, only flavoring comes from byproducts or ""flavorings""2 - Zero ""Country of Origin"" information. Lots of stamps about quality control and about how the company is called ""of Vermont"" - but zero information on where this is made (note: ""Distributed By"" is not the same as where its made).3 - Very prominent ""for animal use only"" warning (ie: not for human consumption).Taking these one-by-one -Meat does not need to be in this item because it's not really the dog's main meal. However, quite a few dogs do have gluten allergies, just like humans. Generally speaking, quite a few grains are known to be allergenic to dogs. If you can stay away from processed grains, it's not a bad idea to do so. Unfortunately this does essentially rule out any ""biscuit"" type of treat for dogs.This is a biggie for me.  Many of your major pet food manufacturers have used ingredients from China or have made the entire item there. As we all know, China currently has a pretty bad reputation for... well... poisoning our animals. Most of your pet food manufacturers who use all US-based ingredients in US-based factories are pretty proud of this fact and will prominently label their products as ""Made in the USA"". I think that treats fall into a separate category from actual dog food, so the manufacturers are probably not required to post this information, but again, if it's made in the USA, why wouldn't you include it?  Even when made in the USA, we're not always great about keeping the salmonella away (as the latest recall in Feb 2013 proves). Knowing factory of origin is a real bonus here.Whenever things are labeled ""for animal use only,"" it usually means that there are non-human grade items in the product. When you're looking at feeding your pet things like probiotics, Omega-3's and so forth, often the human-grade version ends up being cheaper. Since the human grade versions usually have to pass more stringent tests than the pet variety, ""spiking"" treats with non-human grade ingredients just doesn't make much sense.So about the product - after using this for about a week, I haven't seen anything significant with my pups (Malamute / Shiba).  My Mally is a pretty calm dog to begin with so not much difference there. My Shiba plays the alpha and generally likes to chase squirrels, bark at/with the neighbor dog, yell at the UPS man when he's dropping off packages and so forth. These chews haven't really changed any of those behaviors.";0
119807;The vet gave me the topical tapeworm treatment and it was like trying to treat a flopping fish in the bottom of the boat.  Plus when it dried it turned to a white powder that lasted almost a month.  That's not to say the product didn't work but I just wasn't sure.  I decided to give this pill version a month later (and THAT was no picnic!!) just as a precaution.  My cat is definitely feeling better with more energy and better appetite.  Plus there's 3 treatments in the bottle so it's much more economical.;0
87020;I have owned and fed three different cats this food and they have all loved it. The food comes in smaller pieces than some other brands that I have owned which seems to make it easier to eat for my cats. Their coats remain shiny and they always come running when they hear me open the bag. I have been a huge fan of the Natural Balance brand for many years now, they make great quality products. Highly recommended!;0
106837;When I introduced my new kitten to canned food, I bought about a dozen different brands and flavors to see what she liked. This one won out, hands down. I like that it has a variety of meats in it, and she likes the little chunks in gravy rather than a pate.;0
114950;"Little things to know - these biscuits are rock hard - if your dog has fragile teeth avoid them, if your dog devours everything in sight you might find they work.  They are about 1"" square and 1/4"" thick with a 2 biscuits stuck together - they even put a score line in the 2""x1"" pair so you can break them with your hand.They don't have a strong odor - in trainging my dog right now we've had several tests where we put down yummy treats and teach the dogs to walk in an oval avoiding the treats.  This particular one was ignored by all dogs - it doesn't smell good which seems to be the key to a treat working well - hot dogs were preferred 10/0 over these biscuits by the dogs in the class.I am presently training a purebread (3 generation 1/2 german 1/2 american) german shepherd dog and treats are an essential part of the process when your dog is food motivated.  The Lamb and Barley flavors don't really attract the attention of the dog when working with it and build attention span.  This dog is spoiled rotten getting a kong stuffed with peanut butter frozen overnight and fed GSD dog feed designed for the nutritional needs of a GSD.Training involves repeating the command and holding the treat in front of the dog's nose to get them to learn the commands - these worked the first time then not so well- I had to find something that smelt better as the dog would igore the treat.  Presently my dog is 6 months old and in a weekly training class with other dogs - we use chicken pieces, turkey pieces, and hot dog slugs to entise the dog into behaving well.  These were nowhere as motivating as the hot dog pieces which seemed to get the most attention.I am pleased that they are organic in nature but they lack a strong odor for the pet.  The pouch they come in is helpful to keep on your belt when training as well.  I don't see a real value in the product for dog training - they are almost too big for even big dogs, so hard to break they are pre-scored to 1x1, and just don't get the interest of the dogs - we tried a malamute, a husky, and my dog and they were only effective if the dog was really hungry!  Also the price is kinda high - I found a 10 pack of hotdogs next door for $2.50 which included a zipper pouch too.";0
94523;This is a great running leash.  I especially like it because it does not attach around my waist.  It is well built, the right length for running and has a great handhold.  I highly recommend this product.;0
118494;I still don't seem to be able to order the right size. For my Italian Greyhounds the XS are a little tight and the S are a little too big. But they are well made and I can recommend them. The transaction was smooth, the items came in quickly and well packaged.;0
56958;My babies love these pill pockets.....they think they are treats so it's no problem at all giving them a pill;0
119569;Really like these scissors for cutting our dogs hair.  We had the smaller ones but these longer sheers work so much easier to cut more hair at once and get more done before our dog squirms which he does a lot when using these, especially on his face.  I also feel safer (for our dog and me) that I am not going to accidently jab him with the ends.  Very pleased with purchase.;0
974;Great for my determined chewer. He spends quite a bot of time chewing on it. It is made of a very hard plastic material.;0
127187;My dog is a BIG chewer, I can't give him stuffed animals at all.  Even Kong products he manages to break but these keep him busy for weeks!;0
4812;I bought this a while back and it wasnt too bad, some parts of its surface were clogged and it really disrupted the water, but other than that it worked fine.;0
92403;The dark color shows every single little piece of cat fur (the underfur of almost all cats is light colored).  We live in a apartment and only have an apartment sized washer, this is just too bulky--well, it fits in the washer sort of, if you mash it in, but it won't rotate so only gets partially clean and trying to get the fur off is impossible.  Fur also accumulates inside the dome.  It'd be better if the sides velcroed together so you could unhinge it flat for washing and cleaning.  Cats love the confined space, especially in winter when the room gets cold at night.  It's a little too small for our big male (he squeezes in but can't stay in longer than 10 mins. before he's cramped and/or overheated).;0
97069;I bought this for my small ladrador, not really knowing how big they were. She loved them but the sticks were chihuahua sized. it was a funny experance. I just wish that they had bigger sizes.;0
150333;I love these compressed air cans. They are a safe way to keep my cats from getting into areas and objects I don't want them in.;0
55685;Glad to find something that helps my dog bad breath. First thing I found that works. Just give it a try and see.;0
111024;There is a lot of commotion in my household before we go out for a walk. When I first got this harness, it was difficult to put on because I forget which leg goes on first, which clasp goes where, etc. But after a few tries, it became very easy, especially because the only thing you have to put through the harness is one leg--the rest just clips on easily. That's a nice change from those harnesses that require putting your dog's head in and then leg, etc. It also seems to be fairly comfortable for my harness-hating puppy. She tries to bite it at first and then in a few seconds she forgets she has it on.;0
29714;One of the only toys we have that has held up for years with no holes. A+ toy.;0
151150;Our 10 year old toy pom really likes this food. I think it is a keeper IF blended in with another of higher quality because, aside from the chicken, most of the ingredients don't make the grade on the dogfoodproject website, although all have been determined by someone to meet all required standards.;0
30690;They love it. It's good quality and you can't beat the price. So funny to see even my dane carrying this.;0
117307;my Veterinary recommends this for my senior dog who has problems with restlessness. I have ordered it twice. I don't know if it made a difference or not. I am out now, so I'll see if I see any untoward behavior. Some people have reviewed that this product made a big difference and others saw no difference. I think I am in the latter camp but I am just not sure.;0
126067;Got a cat that gets bored with all' his toys? Well this well help him get excited about play time every time. It crinkles and it has catnip so they're even more willing to play when you take out this baby.  All I have to do is make it crinkle just a little bit and my 10 month old Main Coon mix comes running.;0
21311;"I bought my 7 month old black lab the bee hive with bees two months ago.  She absolutely loves it and has not damaged the hive or the bees (although I did buy replacement bees ""in case"").  I got her the squirrels for a Christmas present and about an hour after having it, one of the squirrels tore (seam ripped) and I had to sew it.  She does like to carry the stump around but there is hard cardboard at the base which she continues to try and chew.  A nice toy and she does like to remove and play with the squirrels and stump but not as much as the bee-hive.  (The bees are a bit softer and not stuffed as much.  I think that is why they survived so long and the seam ripped on the squirrel.)";0
93158;Fantastic product that no dog owner should be without. It cleans there accidental actions and takes away the scent that they don't come back to;0
20532;It took us a minute to figure out how it went on but after glancing over the instructions & pics we figured it out. My 105lb lab/rott tried to not let us put it over his nose, but you can tighten it easily so once you do get it over their nose, you're almost done. Much easier to get on than a pinch collar and works better too, without harming the dog. He shook his head for a minute but once we got walking it didn't bother him and he didn't pull at all. He walked by our side.No more sniffing everything along the way either!The large fit him & he does have the large Rott head.This thing rocks.;0
152075;My dog is perfectly happy with this Iams dog food, but no more or less so than with other dog foods.;0
50983;When we rescued 5 kittens, we bought this to make clean up a bit easier. It pretty much does everything for you, you just empty it into a bad and throw it into the trash. We figured we would get rid of it once we gave the kittens away. We kept two of the kittens and decided to keep the self-cleaning litter box because of the ease of use! Do yourself a favor and buy this. Even if you just have one cat. It will be worth it, I promise!;0
117651;Its OK. Cheap plastic construction materials used. It does the job and helped alot with my dogs &#34,return the ball&#34, training, but thats it. The collars are light duty and the batteries need to be recharged, almost after each use. If you leave it on your dog for the day, its useless the next day. I would not buy again or recommend it. This is a good &#34,You get what you pay for&#34, example.;0
11149;I purchased this item with the Purebred Pet Mitt Grooming Massaging Brush and in conjunction they work perfectly. I will use this brush to start on my cat and then follow thru with the mitt and I can't believe how much hair they get. I have two dogs who do not shed so having this cat was a big transition with flying hair all over the place. I have seen a big improvement with less hair around the house since I started using these. My cat does like to be brushed and these feel good to her so that is a big plus as well.;0
8391;I have a Doberman with dry itchy winter skin. The Vet was selling me expensive DHA caps (#2 a cap every day adds up) and I asked about switching to salmon oil. I did buy human grade caps but last time they were out. I got this and now I LOVE it. easy to use, my Dobermans get 3 pumps and little pom get a half pump. Their coats are shiney and no more winter itching;0
50557;We're having trouble with a picky eater not eating enough calories. This is one of the highest calorie, high meat content, NO grain content foods we could find. My dog absolutely loves this food. He's finally chowing through his meals.;0
120453;Wow, this box is big. I bought 1 16 lb package of litter to go in this box & I need more litter.I have 2 cats, they both like & use this box, 1 likes a clean box so as soon as this was on the floor with litter in it she was making a deposit.My other cat doesn't cover her #2 (Gross!) but this box being covered even with the large entrance does help control the stink. I'm still using a mat outside the front because they are still tracking litter out but the cover keeps the litter inside when they dig. I'm very happy with this box.;0
9073;I have a mali uromastyx and even this 160 watt is not hot enough.  It advertise as heat and UB and light, but then the instructions indicated that you may need another heat source.  I use it with 150 watt heat lamp for my mali, this seems to do the trick in a 40 gallon tank.  Just disappointed that I had to get another heat source after paying so much for this.  Well, maybe it would be find for bearded dragons, I don't know.;0
10480;After my lab destroyed 3 of the larger red Kongs, I decided to try this one, and voila, it has worked for nearly 3 months!  He chews and chews and there are no signs of deterioration.  He has met his match!  I am so happy they make this.;0
70893;My dog has really bad allergies due to cold dry weather. The reviews were good so I thought I try it. It smells decent like tea oil but I was hoping stronger. My dog did ok the first evening but the next day he was back to itching. I will update on my second use!;0
69375;Chihuahuas are not easy to train, they are stubboorn in that regard.  These pads seems to lure the dog to them, and for that I am very happy.  The price is better than the stores, so I consider this one of those great buys on Amazon;0
140765;I've been giving this to my Toy Fox Terrier for about a week now and she just loves it.  I have been mixing it with another brand until she gets used to it so we don't have a problem with sensitive stomach.  She'll pick this out of her dish first and then when this is gone she'll eat the old brand.  So funny watching her be so picky.  She hasn't had any stomach upset which is great so thumbs up there.  It's smaller sized kibble than alot of others so she seems to eat slower with chewing it up better.Now I wasn't 100 percent happy with the ingredients label but I have seen worse.  I try and keep her on a food that has less crude fat and more protein but here is the clincher.Crude Protein: 42%Crude Fat: 22%Crude Fiber: 4.5%Moisture: 8.0%Omega 3 Fatty Acids: 0.3%Omega 6 Fatty Acids: 2.6%72% pure animal ingredients and nutritious oils28% vegetables and fruits, fortified with vitamins and minerals0% grain, gluten, and potatoSo as you can see there are some pros and cons to this food but there is with all of them.  I would feel better if that crude fat were lower but we'll have to wait and see.  I try very hard to watch what she eats so she won't gain weight as she has bad rear legs so time will tell if this will work or not.;0
135548;My two kittens and I were visiting my sister in August. They were 8 weeks old when we arrived, and very good at using the litter box. Unfortunately, my boy, Chance, began adopting the &#34,dig to China&#34, method of litter box use. The boxes I had brought and the one my sister had on hand were getting too messy that we were vacuuming the carpet every day, and it was a waste of litter. Plus the kittens began to out grown the small one (we were there for a month). I realized that I had no boxes at home for when we returned, so I looked on Amazon and was thrilled to find this one! It comes with a scoop that is not gigantic but is strong plastic and it has multiple places to be stored, plus the shield would (I hoped) block all of Chance's digging from covering my floor (at least on 3 sides)! On top of all of that, I couldn't believe the price! I probably looked like one of those cartoons that gets really shocked & their eyes pop out. It was great!Having two kittens who will soon be cats, and Chance was already pretty big by nearly 12 weeks, I ordered two of these litter boxes (2 cats, 2 boxes). My apartment is long so I figured one at each end is the best. They arrived while I had a friend staying so they were here when we got home. The kittens both took right to them, and Chance taught his sister, Kismet, the &#34,dig to China&#34, method (she's not that big on it though), but they've been so good about keeping it in the box, even with one side open They even use the edges of the shield to wipe their paws off before exiting the box.Of course cats will track litter, but this had reduced how much they kick out of the boxes while still allowing them to dig to China! Some people like the totally enclosed kind, but I've had only very large cats that end up not fitting inside those, so this should not be an issue no matter how huge my little boy gets (they are almost 7 months old & he's about 10lbs. Kismet is maybe 6 or 7ibs, if that!). These seem to be very sturdy plastic and I expect they will last a long time. I highly recommend this to messy cats, but do suggest getting a table that can be above it so nothing falls in the poop pile, or putting it somewhere that wouldn't create that risk.PROS:Keeps the floor cleanIncludes scoop & places to store the scoopIdeal size & shapeCost is AMAZING!Easy to clean0 CONS!;0
102139;"Although my 11 pound sensitive Shih Tzu hates this, it's a five star dog toy.  TheKong Wobbler Treat Dispensing Dog Toy, Largeis heavy and much larger than any other ""small"" dog toy and the principle is great.  Insert the treats or dry food into the lightweight top with the hole, screw on the weighted base, flip it over and the dog will be able to knock it around, releasing the contained kibble.  This dog freaked out and would walk several feet around the Kong because of the sound it makes.  She would rather not eat than have to knock this around to obtain the reward.  Being a sharing dog, she gave it to another less fearful dog who loves the thing.  I'd strongly recommend checking the toy out in a brick and mortar store before making a purchase if you're on the fence because it's so much larger and heavier than other Kong dog toys.  Being able to wash this in the dishwasher is a strong advantage for those who actually use it to dispense food.  The red color also makes it hard to miss when on the floor.";0
59800;We adopted a puppy and I've been comparing prices online vs. in store. This bed got some great reviews. I did find at a local pet store and it was $35 more expensive. Ordered online and while there was a big box to recycle, it was a great deal. Can't wait to introduce the puppy to it.;0
1133;"So while I was getting ready for my new corgi puppy I purchased this from Amazon. I thought, ""Hey--good for strong chewers and he'll be teething! Perfect!"" Add to that the fact that I love dinosaurs and this was a must.At a checkup for my cats before the dog came home I talked to my vet about some of the concerns with the new puppy, and her recommendations for good chew toys. She warned us against the white Nylabone toys specifically. She didn't want our dog to have anything harder than a tooth to chew on (including bones and hard plastic toys like this) because of the potential to crack his teeth. Even though he's a puppy, she was concerned about the possibility of infection and abscess in a cracked tooth and the dangers of putting a puppy under for oral surgery to extract the cracked tooth/teeth. I'm glad she did warn me because I never would have known.As soon as we got back from the appointment I returned it and Amazon gave me a refund no problem (five stars for the customer service there), so that was good. In retrospect, I can see she was right. If nothing else I could have kept the toy to beat up any intruders in my apartment--it really is that hard.";0
101260;Works very well so far. However, I've been using the Simple Solution Triple Oxy spray bottle, which actually has stronger cleaning power (spray on stains to clean) but gives an awful smell that takes awhile to go away. That was the one thing I couldn't find about the Simple Solution Extreme was what kind of scent it would give off. I went ahead and bought the gallon anyways since it's much cheaper than buying the smaller spray bottles every time. I am quite pleased with the SS Extreme's scent which smells like baby powder. Overall this was a great buy and I will continue buying the Extreme gallon refill.;0
27317;I have a Sphynx cat that loves these treats. Sphynx are a smaller breed, and he chews these up with no trouble after playing soccer with it for awhile.;0
112362;I love the quality of ingredients, not to mention a great price.  Living to a ripe old age of 15, my dog was quite agile and energetic until the very end, I attribute considerably to eating this product.  In fact, until the last month, he was still begging me to take him for our 2-mile walks every morning! Granted, he could not see or hear as well at the end, but, his body and joints, especially, really kept in good shape with these walks, natural dogfood, and supplements, this made all the difference in the world to us both! Everyone, even the professionals, claimed he would get feeble and have a hard time even getting up the last couple years...NOT.  In fact, even on days he did get a little wobbly, after the next walk, he was walking fine. Thanks. Merrick!I recommend this highly to everyone who love their family member the way I did mine! If ever I get another such precious companion, I will certainly buy Merricks's organic dogfood!;0
145515;This is a good deal and the clicker really works, don't know why.  My boxer hears the clicker, from just a pup, and sits right to attention, not taught to.  The whistle is good too.  Love the stretchy band.;0
32042;Great calorie control for dog.  I have a Cardgian Welsh Corgi.  Corgis in general can gain weight very easily and this stresses their joints tremendously.  These are small, low calories, and very tasty.  I use them as rewards for training.  Perfect.;0
8620;Excellent! Super heavy duty. I do not fear that the dog will rip or dig it out of the ground. He cannot bend the top loop, either. It actually wasn't hard at all to get it the whole way into the ground. I thought for sure it would take much longer and much more strength, but it was done in 5 minutes or less. Definitely plan n using some sort of rod or pole to stick through the top loop to turn. We used a prybar and were done in no time.Take the black tip cover off and there is a point on the end. Push it in until the 3 blades touch the ground and then start turning it into the ground with your rod/prybar. Make sure to get it the whole way into the ground so that the top cap piece is as tight on the ground as possible.I am very happy with this purchase. The price was so much better than the stakes I have seen in any store and the quality of this one is 100 times better. I bought it along with Prestige Super-Beast Dog Tie-Out, 30 feet and it is the absolute perfect combination for our strong and determined pitt bull. I have NO fears of him breaking or chewing through this combination of cable and stake!!;0
17879;Nice and convient to order got here fast. Product is what it is and a great supplier no problems with the store.;0
118264;We were having troubles with our Scottish Fold kitten's eyes when she was 1.5-3 month old. Tried to use medicine prescribed by our vet, it helped of course, but the cat was really nervous about the procedures. This liquid works perfectly with her eyes - sometimes it seems to be working better than medical staff, and it doesn't irritate our cat.;0
68159;This works great for when the crabs are molting, and they love it otherwise. My only problem is that it gets a bit soggy because sometimes they spill a little of their salt water or drinking water. It absorbs plenty of moisture in my tank, and rarely ever gets moldy. It worked so well for mr hermit crabs and I will continue to buy it!;0
108072;For the price, this toy was great for about an hour.  It is a foam puzzle you put together and then push the 2 &#34,pedals&#34, down in the back that will slide a piece of foam with a fish sticker on it out from under the little fringed door.  After an hour of play, both fish permanently stick out about 1/2.  The most intelligent of my 2 cats, turned the toy around to pull the fish out from the back side.If you want a special toy/treat for a cat and do not mind that it is good for an hour, this is your toy!If the fish were hinged better and would fully retract, I would give it 5 stars because both of my cats loved this toy.;0
22851;"After my cat had a nasty UTI a few years ago, I decided to try putting him on Purina One's urinary tract health formula to see if it would keep him healthy in the future. It gave me peace of mind to be taking a proactive step to protect my cat's health. And it seemed like a fine food. But my cat was definitely unexcited about it. He tolerated it, but he clearly didn't relish it. He only ate it because that was all I gave him. Plus, I started hearing through the grapevine of cat owners that there were better products out there for urinary tract health.So, I asked my vet, and he recommended a high-end urinary tract health food that I decided to try, and my cat loved it. So it was bye-bye Purina One. I have nothing against Purina One - like I said, it seemed like a good quality product - but my cat just didn't ""dig"" it for some reason. Too bad, because the Purina One was a lot cheaper than what I give my cat now! Oh well...";0
107413;My kitchen is dusty rose colored and i keep the cats food and water in the corner so this is perfect. I like that its made out of rubber easy to wash. Great size too;0
28126;We got these for our 5 week old puppy, who we knew was too little to leave alone for 8 hours (during the workday) without a potty option. These worked very well. They contain the moisture, are a good size, and were by far the best value for the $ that we saw. Would definitely recommend to other dog or puppy owners.;0
86840;Cause of death: lobotomy.My dog ate the eyes first, then the ears, then pulled all the stuffing out of the head. She loved this thing day in and day out until there was nothing left but the strong rope body (which remains in her toy box). I will probably buy another one soon. :);0
19840;"My lab absolutely loves the lamb lung.  It is his favorite treat.  The pieces are reasonable size, typically about 1/2"" cube, and there are typically only very few small bits so little wastage.";0
156611;This is pretty good food.  While this doesn't contain actual meat, there is plenty of protein in it.  Via dogfoodadvisor(.)comChicken meal is considered a meat concentrate and contains nearly 300% more protein than fresh chicken.  The other ingredient are also quite good as well.  The food is small and my little dog can eat it easily.  There are better foods out there, but for the price this is a much better option than some of the grocery store foods you can buy.  Overall it's a nice quality food for a good price.;0
29334;The scoop works great for getting things moved around in the tank, the algae scrapers are pretty much worthless because it's very difficult to get this thing at the right angle to scrape the glass when you have ornaments and lights in the tank. If you're buying it for the scoop - go for it. If you're buying it hoping to reach hard to reach places to scrape the glass then forget it, you're going to have to take everything out of your tank to get this thing at the right angle to use it that way.;0
107098;I have had Outward Hound jackets for over 15 years. I still have my original one, which had a better design than the current one, including pockets on the sides of the jacket. They changed to the current design a few years ago. It's a great jacket but will get waterlogged eventually if you do not treat it with fabric waterproofer. Wash it first with Grangers waterproofing cleaner, then when it's wet spray with Grangers fabric waterproofer and dry on warm for about 15 minutes (do this to your own rain shells also!). My only beef with this XL is that it is too big and long for my dog, whereas the large is too short for him. He is a long German Shepherd/Collie mix, about 75 lbs. He is 28 inches from the back of neck to the start of the tail. the large is about 25 inches when it's pulled up all the way on the dog like it's supposed to be. The XL is about 32 inches long. I have to return or sell one of the two jackets I got at a very good price. I am going to try and alter the remaining jacket since I paid so little for it.;0
19568;I ordered the Timothy Hay Cubes because our two piggies seem to love the loose hay that we always get them and these would give them the fiber plus something to chew on. They were pretty affordable and my pair of guinea pigs definitely seem to enjoy them!;0
45259;This exercise pen has been a God-Send for our dogs and for us! We have a 2lb Yorkie and a 7lb Poodle and they love being in this pen outside or inside. It's very durable  and has stood the Texas cold and hopefully the hot! It hasn't fallen down or even been knocked down. No rusting even after being left out in the rain and is easy to put away  and take apart, along with reassembly as needed.;0
37308;My mom and dad have a gorgeous Norwegian Forest Cat who adopted them as parents several years ago. His only bad habit is occasional clawing of one of the chairs. I have the tall post version of this and our cats absolutely love it, so I thought one of these would make a good Christmas gift for their furry formerly stray boy.It arrived a few days before Christmas and Mom cracked it open for him. She wasn't sure if she should prop it up on the wall or what, so she set it down on the floor until she figured out which option would be best. Not long afterward, she found said cat sitting on one end of the new Combination Scratcher and blissfully clawing his fool head off at the other end -- he LOVES it! The latest report from Mom says that she hasn't seen him clawing the chair since the Scratcher has arrived.So their house is now closer to global peace, at least between the big furry kid and the defenseless chair. This Combination Scratcher is an excellent product, and I can attest that sisal twine is extremely appealing to nearly all cats. Two of our cats are declawed and they still stretch their bodies and &#34,claw&#34, with their nubs, seemingly very happy with the ritual.My opinion is that it's an excellent product for nearly every cat!(because nothing is perfect, but this is darn close);0
136036;All natural, naturally renewing, not bleached or dyed.  As advertised.  My dogs love them so much they each have to have their own;0
150768;Well there is no question that this is excellent cat food nutritionally speaking.  Comparing it to the ingredients in something like Meow Mix brings about quite the separation of ordinary commercial blends and something like this that takes it all very seriously. Unfortunately all that work, research, and quality that the bag talks about has not translated into something that merely taste good.  Not to my cat or others I have offered it too anyway.  My own cat that is going on 22 now tried a few morsels and then just walked away.  And the couple of neighborhood cats that come around occasionally for a free meal ate a little more of it but have since taken to looking at me with a disagreeable look on their face.  I've tried it several times and just cannot get them interested in it. (And mixing it in with my cats regular meal has also proven to be a failure as well.  She just eats around it).  I think I will feed the rest of what I have to the raccoons and possums that prowl around my yard at night who I am sure will be far less particular.  I would have really liked to have seen my elderly cat chow down on this stuff for I believe its much better for her than the regular store bought mixes she loves.  And I have given this brand an extra star for their efforts.  But unfortunately I cannot recommend it with the high price it carries, and more importantly with it not appealing to the number of cats I tried it with... : );0
58329;I adopted my Dexter September of last year, he is a five year old male, mixed pooch Jack Russell Terrier and Chihuahua since he has been with me he has gained a considerable amount of weight I wasn't concerned in the beginning but now I am. So onto the internet I went on the hunt for an automatic feeder with portion control. Finding what I was looking for was easy, trying to find out which foods are causing his allergies is another review altogether. Maybe another reviewer will have pity on me and offer up some sage advice. I just want to help my Dexter!I bought the Petmate LeBistro portion control automatic feeder. It works very well, unfortunately due to the nature of Dexter's formidable years, he tends to shy away almost run from anything that makes loud noises. And as LeBistro is dispensing the food Dexter runs and hides, I cannot get him to feed. I have to take the food out of the bowl and put it in his old bowl as per the instructions. But it has been a few weeks now and I have made no progress. Please, this is no attack on the product as I said before, it works well. But not all dogs are created equal and mine is special in every way.;0
74;"In a household with three adult cats I was constantly cleaning the litter box.  With the Littermaid LM900 I need only empty or replace the waste container about twice a week.  The litter is kept clean and smoothed by the automatic raking action.  Odors are minimal since waste is stored in a closed container and the exposed litter is continually cleaned.  Make sure you only use premium, clumping litter.  That's the good news.Now for the not so good news.  The unit is noisy with a capital ""N"".  Don't plan on placing it near the living spaces in your home if you value your peace and quiet.  Waste frequently lodges between the teeth on the rake so I'm finding myself visually checking anytime I'm near the unit and using my scoop to clear the rake.  About every other day I need to use the scoop to scrape along the bottom of the pan to loosen anything sticking to the bottom so the rake can catch it on the next pass.  Lastly, the included ramp which is supposed to keep your cat from tracking litter is a joke.  It simply isn't big enough and my cats usually jump over it rather than walk down it.  To solve the problem, I continue to leave a small area rug in front of the unit.  That seems to catch about 75% of the tracked litter. the unit isn't cheap.  Taking into account the noise and the other problems, I would still buy the unit if I had to do it over again primarily for the conveninence.";0

92262;Hard to rate dog food if you don't eat it!  My dog loves these and I actually use these as treats rather than food.  Saves me lots of money over those expensive dog treats.  The texture feels like ground beef... and it doesn't smell too bad.  I wish the bag was resealable.;0
44459;I'm not a vet but I've worked in health care most my life.  Antibiotics should never be used long term, never.  Not in humans and not in animals.  PLEASE READ the directions on the bottle.  It plainly states the amount to give according to your dog size and that it should NOT to be given long term.  Also, use common sense.  If you have a puppy that has just teethed or had teeth pulled recently, understand that the tear staining may be greater than usual and you may want to wait awhile before administering this product.  Additionally the absolute BEST thing you can do for your dog having tear stains, is trim the hair away from the dogs eyes (I trim my maltese hair from his eyes every three or four days) and wash the dogs face at least twice a day.  Also using an eye rinse to wash the eyes out every day, is a good idea, certainly not going to hurt, and may help dramatically.  This product does work but it should be used only as described and for no longer than stated.  I gave a quarter teaspoon in peanut butter to my dog for 4 weeks.  There was dramatic improvement and I consistently trimmed the hair around the eyes.  I then discontinued use and I do wash his eyes out every day and wash his face, all the while trimming any new hair that comes in around the eyes.  He has only a slight apricot color at the eyes and that is fine.  Finally, Angel Eyes SHOULD include a measuring spoon with this product and to charge people for a cheap less than one cent to make spoon is pretty low down.;0

39467;I can tell when these run out because one of my males starts spraying the house every move he makes.  It doesn't stop him from spraying, but definitely slows  him down.  The bad thing about it is it doesn't always last a month.  I started circleing the day on the calendar that I replaced it and once it lasted almost and the next time it only lasted two weeks.  Really sucks when they are so expensive, but I can't stop using them so I guess I will hope the rest of them last closer to a month!;0

157088;I have just adopted a psycho kitten. He was abandoned at 3 weeks old and left to die next to a lake where bugs and worms chewed at him. He was not able to have the love of a mother or siblings and was therefore not taught how to act with other cats. Once he was rescued, he spent time at the vets and was then placed in a rescue shelter. I have another adult male that I had adopted 6 months ago who is a 20 pound ball of love. He has tried to &#34,mother&#34, this kitten, but he is absolutely crazy. He bites, destroys everything in site, kicks the crap out of my other cat...the list goes on. I have had him now for a month and I have been working with him daily and he has improved. He is starting to show affection but is still a bit aggressive with my other cat and still has psychotic moments. After reading the reviews, I decided to try this. After putting the collar, it took about 24 hours before I noticed anything. He was SLIGHTLY more affectionate and calm. Yes, there has been a very small change in him, but I don't think it's worth the fifteen dollars every month. I will see in a month after its time to replace it and decide whether there is a big enough change in him or not. At this point, I'm not real convinced this is going to be the cure.;0
78105;The thought behind this was good.  First they don't stay stuck together at all.  Very thin and tore easily.  Cost too much for such a poorly designed product.  Would not purchase again unless they make some big changes.;0
59933;My dogs absolutely love this food.  I did a food test by putting each dog food we have at home next to the Orijen, every time, our dogs chose the Orijen bag! Thanks, The Cohen family, and the three fur-kids;0
120711;After reading the reviews on this, and having looked for a similar item for a long time, I decided to go for it. So far, I am glad I did. I rated it four stars instead of five simply bc it's made in china. I should've noticed that but I didn't. That's  the only thing I don't like about it so far. It was easy to wash, assemble and fill, and it's very quiet. There is virtually no sound to it but I know the dogs can probably hear something. Even if they do it hasn't stopped them from using it. Both took to it right away, and I have already noticed a decrease in the amount of spills and drips/drools on the floor. Normally, I have to fill and clean and refill the dog and cat water bowls two or three times a day, so I am pretty psyched not to have to do that. It holds a lot more water than I expected it to, and it's lasting longer than I thought it would before needing a refill. The water stays really clean and just pools at the top of the bowl - there isn't a true fountain or a lot of water movement, which I expected for some reason. Given that many similar products are much more expensive and have far fewer positive ratings and reviews, I would consider this a great deal, so far!;0
73710;These bowls do the job.What I like about them:- They are made of hygienic stainless steel so they can be cleaned easily- The rubberized bottom prevents the bowls from sliding around- They are shallow enough to where cats can eat comfortably.What I don't like that much:- The stickers attached to the outside of the bowls are extremely hard to remove, even when soaking them they require some Goo Gone to remove all traces. This could and should be done much better.- We own several of these bowls and it is amazing how different in quality they are. There seems to be no consistency. Some are shallower than others, some heavier, some more light-weight. It seems as if the quality has gone down over the years...Summary:They are OK but overpriced for what they offer. I would only buy them again because there are no alternatives that I have seen.;0
126547;My 27 lb feist Annie is pretty high energy, smart, and food-motivated, and this food dispenser toy is great for her. She figured out quickly just how to move, roll, or drop the toy to get the kibble out, but hasn't gotten bored with it yet (after 3 months of daily use). Most of her meals are dispensed this way, and unlike many dispensers, this will hold her full serving (total capacity is probably about 2 - 2.5 cups, but she eats about 1.25 cups per meal). It's nice that it's easy to see from across the room how much food is left in it.I like that I can adjust the difficulty so when she's not as high energy I can make it easier and when she's hyper I can make it more challenging. Even on the easiest setting, it's slow enough to dispense that she can't wolf down her meal. She will generally keep at it until the last few pieces of kibble are left that are too large to fit through the holes, then bring it to me to unscrew for her to earn those last few bites with tricks. It's also quite durable and stands up to her biting, carrying, and dropping it, though I don't leave her alone with it as the plastic could potentially splinter and hurt her.The only drawback to this item for me is that sometimes the lid unscrews instead of the neck, and I don't really see the point of having two separate points to screw and unscrew the toy.;0
105678;We have had this feeder for over 6 months and it works as expected. It is easy to assemble and mount. For those picky people it is a bit noisy but it does not bother turtles. You need to be careful to dispense not too much food if you leave it unattended not to get aquarium dirty.;0

58583;[...]This was the first Nina Ottoson toy i purchased for my two dogs, an 10 year old jack russell an a 3 month border terrier. THEY LOVE IT!!! as soon as i take it out of the closet they go absolutely nuts! i had to train them both to take turns because they would attack the puzzle like kids in a candy store. Even though Nina Offers other puzzles that are on an easier level i thought this would be better to star out with.... and i was right ! after a lot of pawing and digging they finally started to develop their own techniques to get to the treats and are super successful. I love this puzzle because it really enriches their minds and makes me super proud to see them finish it.;0

35826;I was thrilled when my older and very particular cat took to this right away.  I knew she would never accept a new bed, she's just that bad.  But with this, it slides underneath her favorite blanket.  When you first plug it in, don't be concerned if it is not as warm as you think it should be.  It gets there and when combined with their natural warmth, you will find quite a toasty spot left behind when they get up.  It is small, but they tell you the measurements in the description.  My husband plugged it in to a timer and we are good to go.*update*  2 months in and still going strong.  Her new favorite spot.  I think she would only like it more if we put it on our bed and added a remote control holder for her.  ,-)*Update* Well it's over 1 year later and the pad is still working great.  We put it away in the summer and when we brought it out again it worked perfectly.  The cat we bought it for still loves it.;0
116000;I have three cats and not one of them would eat this.  I don't know any other way to review cat food, so I have to trust their taste buds.  The food just sat on the floor going bad while they howled for something else.  They eat regular cooked chicken, chicken cat food by other brands, they eat human grade canned chicken, but they wouldn't touch this.  My friend also ordered this food because it is supposed to be made of great ingredients and her cat wouldn't eat it either.;0
157753;Small jar but full and a very little goes a long way. I can't give it all 5 stars only because it didn't help our dog but then we weren't 100% sure that his hair loss on top of his nose or around his eyes was indeed Demodex. We thought we would give this a try since it was much less expensive than a $100 plus skin scraping at the vet. I put it on at bedtime followed by a treat for 3 weeks with no change but again, we weren't sure. It was worth the try anyway.;0
137398;These pads worked no better (or worse) than the $70 green grass trays that I got to entice my three miniature dachshunds to stop going on the carpet.  The dogs ignored the pads entirely.  After two weeks, I managed to catch one pee on the pad.  Nothing works with these guys.;0

I break the sticks in half because they are big and they ARE fattening. She loves them, they are made in America and the price is right. Pure salmon with no additives.  My sweet dog is allergic to just about everything and these appear to cause no skin troubles for her. And she is addicted. Great product. Not sticky or stinky.;0

I often lost site of him and have to wait for the stinker to get tired and come home, on his own ( he always does, but my neighbors don't really like that option). With this light though, that easily attaches to his collar, I can see the little stinker a half mile away. He can run, but he can't hide, as the old saying goes. I love it and my dog really doesn't mind having his built in headlight, especially on a dark night.;0
45885;I purchased this filter for a 20 gallon half moon tank and it is more than powerful enough.  All the water parameters are always perfect, of coarse along with weekly water changes of about 25-40%.  But the best part is how unbelievably quiet it is.  Definitely gonna upgrade my noisy annoying power filters on my 60 gallon to the 405.  It is also a cinch, with no mess, to clean and change filter media (also a wide variety of media and ways to arrange it). Great product.;0

47270;"A short summary of our problem cat's life....We have the sweetest, friendliest cat ever. He's part of a multi-cat household. His problems, and ours, began when he was 4 yrs. old. He began showing dominance by chasing our 14 yr old cat until she'd hide from him & he also started marking his territory in our home!! If you're wondering, yes, he was neutered. He's lucky, very lucky, that we are so kind-hearted. Instead of doing away with him, he's been banished to our closed-in porch.Through the years, I tried a couple different enzyme products, but got frustrated with them because I'd have to mix just the right amount of enzyme with just the right amount of warm water, pour on the urine spot, cover with a damp cloth and make sure the urine spot remained wet for a required amount of time. I grew tired of that, and started using white vinegar, but it didn't get all the smell out. Now, 13 years later, I read an article about Anti-Icky-Poo, and decided to go for it. The deciding factor was that it doesn't need to be kept wet. Off and on, in about 6 weeks time, I managed to use a quart of it on some urine spots on our closed in porch. Imagine my surprise when that nasty smell was finally gone from the porch!!! This stuff works! I recently ordered the gallon size & haven't had to use much because I'm also usingFarnam Comfort Zone Feliway Electric Diffuser with 48-Milliliters Imitation Cat Pheromone.  My vet sold me some Feliway (75mL) Spray several years ago. I used it a few times but stopped because I wasn't comfortable spraying my furniture and walls with it, & you need to spray often. So, that's when Raskal was banished to our closed-in porch.Using Anti-Icky-Poo and Comfort Zone Feliway Diffuser has almost eliminated our problem...our home is intact and finally our porch doesn't stink. Poor, sweet Raskal is still banished to our porch, which we've made very comfy for him through the years. He even has his own cat house with an incandescent bulb we use to heat it in cold weather. We just can't bring ourselves to trust him in our home any more. Maybe someday I'll be brave, plug in a Feliway diffuser, and give him another chance, after all, I can use Anti-Icky-Poo to clean up his mess. *but I really don't want to be cleaning up that kind of mess in our home**After purchasing Anti-Icky-Poo, I found out that if you have a stubborn or old urine spot, that Anti-Icky-Poo will also work if it's kept wet. So just cover it with plastic, wax paper or tinfoil for a while. You'll use less A-I-P & have quicker results. A.I.P. can also be diluted with up to 3 parts water.Taken from the label: "" Engineered to eradicate urine, it will digest any malodorous decay including liquid or dried fluids from vomit, feces, rotten vegetables, fish, milk, ... skunk musk & more, even smoke.""  ""Don't use directly on pets.""A.I.P. has a pleasant smell that I can't quite describe for you. The smell doesn't linger nor does it leave a scent on the sprayed object.";0
80376;I bought this bag for my 5 lb. Yorkie. She fits very awkward inside and it isn't very safe for her. I ended up buying a doggie backpack and it works so much better.;0
47922;I received the blue one and at first the cats played with it but after a while the ball lost it's novelty and so they almost never play with it anymore, but they do use the scratch pad almost daily so it was worth the purchase. I can sometimes spark their re-interest in the toy if I sit there and spin the ball around the track several times. But usually, they get bored with it pretty quickly. Your results will vary. I have a friend who said his cats loved it and played with it so much that he had to put it out of reach at night or his cats would keep him from sleeping. On a rare occasion I will see my cats batting the ball around the track.;0
140784;Have two cats who love this food because of the freeze dryer treats. When I purchased from Amazon for some reason there were a lot more freeze dried chicken bits then store purchase. Weird. My one cat who didn't need to loose weight lost weight on this food. She is so finicky that I had to keep her on it since I couldn't get her to eat other. If you have an overweight cat this food is really good to feed.;0
27953;This product has given me a whole new dog.  We had an out-of-control Chihuahua that barks at the slightest provocation.  When people came around he'd bark non stop and lunge at them and try to bite them. We couldn't stop and talk to anyone because he would keep trying to go at them. He was relentless too. We tried everything, spray collar, obedience class, positive reinforcement, you name it.  Nothing was working.  We always said we'd never get a shock collar before but we had ran out of options and it was where we were afraid he'd bite someone, we couldn't go on walks with him, take him anywhere, etc. without him going ballistic at someone.  So we got this collar and it works brilliantly.  If he's in the yard and someone approaches and he starts to act out, we beep him. He stops and just sits there.  He'd NEVER do that before. If we are on a walk and he moves like he's going to start up, we beep him. Before it was like nothing would break through that mission of his to bark at people.  This just interrupts that response of his. Before, we couldn't leave him outside in his kennel because every little thing would set him off.  Now if he starts up, we just hit the beep and he immediately stops. We tested the different levels on ourselves and settled on 3.  4 was a little too much (for us) and felt like an actual shock.  But 3 is a vibration that feels less than if you were walking on carpet and someone touched you.  It's not even to that level, it's just vibration.  Rarely do we even have to use that, the beep really reels him in. I've read horror stories about other shock collars that when they used it on their dog it went running and yelping, and this just isn't the case with this one. Maybe people had the level too high.  With the level 3 he never yelps or runs, it just interrupts his thought pattern and makes him stop. And in all the time he's been wearing it, no one has even noticed he had it on.I would highly recommend this product!;0
51754;Tennis balls are bad for dogs teeth not to mention the fuzz that tends to come off for them to digest so I tried plastic/rubber balls instead. We have established that my dog doesn't like anything rubber or plastic, I think its the smell/taste plus I'm not sure if I really want toxic smelling things in my babe's mouth. This toy has solved our problems. It throws well, he loves when I squeek it, and he hasn't chewed through the thick material. My 10 pound chihuahua is a fairly heavy chewer (no stuffed animals) but he relates to this as a fetch toy so he doesn't really play with it unless he is bringing it to me for fetch.;0
30937;This may be one of the best things I have bought for my Bichon.  It's very sturdy and easy to get out of our SUV and get him in quickly.  He loves to go in the mall with me and everywhere Else.  We have never had any complaints where we take him and we take him every where except church and the grocery store.  He gets excited when he sees us go to the back to get it out.  Only problem is its hard to shop because everyone comes up to see him .  Do yourself a favor get it.  There is plenty of room for him to turn around, lay down.  It also allows  you to look down into it when you are walking around from the top. It is very well made.;0
139479;The scent is not too overpowering but good enough where i dont have to worry about my garbage stinking so bad when i toss it out.IT's long enough to cover my entire hand and more and also leaves enough room to tie so the odor does not escape.would buy again!;0

102439;Need a good way to distract your puppy?  Want to slow down their feeding?  Or how about the fact that you simply want a good laugh?  This toy fills all those requirements.My puppy had been using a different feeding toy (the kong wobbler toy) and she loved it.  I just wanted something that was a bit more of a challenge.  As soon as I got it I knew this would work for us.  You can adjust the inside piece for level of difficulty AND the two hole system makes her work a bit harder.  I use this as a way to initially entertain her when she's moved into her kennel area and when I need some down time.  She will push this little ball all over the place and I find it hilarious when she can hear the food but just can't seem to figure out how to get it out.My ONLY down side to this toy is that she seems to have gotten a bit food aggressive with it.  Not her food bowl or her kong wobbler toy, just this one.  When my other dog gets close to the kennels edge while it's there she starts growling.  Yeah, we're working on fixing that now.;0
75386;Dogs seemed to like them but I didn't notice any difference in tartar control with them.  Rather expensive for what they did.;0
110869;I love the unit but wish they would have added four more bolt holes to it. Even though it is designed for up to a 15 pound cat, I wanted a little more security between the two haves. They included extra nuts and bolts which is a plus. I drilled four more holes and added the nuts/bolts. Great unit;0
33169;"This is the best clumping clay litter I have tried, and I think I have tried every litter on the market. I like World's Best Cat Litter because it is light and easy to clean, but many cats do not like the natural corn scent. If your cat prefers clay litter, this one is the best. It's all natural, meaning there are no added chemicals intended to mask smell. You may have noticed that many brands marketed as ""unscented"" actually still smell quite strongly of perfume! I am not sure why companies do that, but the bottom line is that added scent is for humans, not cats - cats prefer unscented litter. If the litter box stinks, you need to clean it more often, or consider changing your cat's diet to a high quality meat canned food. Covering up the smell with perfume doesn't work and may drive your cat to start avoiding the litter box as the strong chemical smell will irritate her sensitive nose.Dr. Elsey's litter is as dust-free as any clay litter could be. The dust is minimal while filling the ox and when your cat uses it.The clumps formed are tight enough to keep the unused litter clean, but not overly sticky.the texture is just right, according to my cats.if your cat has litterbox issues, Dr. Elsey's also makes a similar litter called Cat Attract, which contains herbs known to attract cats. You can also buy the attractant separately and add to any brand of litter. I tried it and my cats all immediately went to the box and dug around in it. They obviously could smell the powder and liked it!";0
79519;This product does what it says it does and my cat likes it daily. At least so far he has been willing to eat it daily.;0
25217;I read all reviews seems most of the people are satisfied with it, so I decide to give it a try!First, I like the way it reads, is very easy and straight forward, colorize.But, when I compare to my big in-tank professional thermometer, I found the reads is 5 degree high than the actual! that's total unacceptable, if it's only 1 or 2 degree, it's ok, but 5 is too much!Not recommended at all!;0
138522;The carabiner is kind of a pain to use.  I like it because it fits well in a pocket when I am not using it.  To be honest it is not much better than a cheap leash that costs 5 bucks.;0
153563;These are small, thin treats, and work for our toy, medium, and large dog equally well.  Even our picky toy gets excited over these treats consistently, which is a minor miracle!Best of all, they are made in the USA from chicken in the USA, so no worries about contamination from China.  I'm leery of most chicken treats due to just not being sure of what the country of origin was, and a lot of name brand chicken treats ARE from China.  In addition, jerky usually comes in random sized chunks, from dust-like bits to huge chunks, and it is difficult to break or cut into appropriate sized treats.  These are thin, about 1 1/2&#34, square, and the toy manages them without any signs of choking, despite his excitement.I really like these treats.  Also, the box contains four smaller packages rather than just a single pack.  These vacuum sealed packages do require refrigeration if it will be more than three days from the time  you open the package until they are gone.  While the dogs may disagree with me on this, there are far too many in one of the inner packages to use in just three days, even with three dogs, so we stash them in a ziplock sandwich bag in the refrigerator.  We get hopeful glances every time we approach the refrigerator anyhow, and now there is even more interest in what we're retrieving from the &#34,Magic Food Box&#34,.Your dog will profess undying loyalty for these, seriously!  (At least until you put them away or they are all gone.);0
28080;First, the measurements: The pads are actually a little smaller than the measurements provided. The measurements provided include the border around the pad (which does not have the absorbent material). However, I must add that we did not use the pads with the holder (we've never used a holder). Second, we found that the pads did not fully absorb our 8 pound Chihuahua's urine (sometimes it leaked right through the plastic underliner). And I cannot imagine what the company is thinking when they promote the idea that liquid turns to gel. No. the urine is absorbed by the cotton (or cotton-like) membrane that is attached to a thin plastic underliner. Third - and I probably should have mentioned this first: The picture is so unbelievably misleading!! You will not receive three packages that are packaged as appears in the picture. Instead, we received three shrink wrapped 'cubes' of 50 pads each - and I should have known there was a problem the moment I saw that each 'cube' was so small. That should have tipped me off to the fact that there was no way 50 pads folded and stacked together then wrapped in shrink wrap could possibly have made such a small 'cube.'  Final word: Not good for my 8 pound Chihuahua....but I am reluctant to say you should not buy them....maybe if your dog is a runt....?;0
151618;These tags are excellent quality tags, very nice engraving that won't scratch off easily. I was very impressed by how nice and large my dogs' names were printed, you can read them from a good distance away. Of course I hope my dogs never get lost, but should the unthinkable happen, someone would be able to read their names from a few feet away and call out to them rather than having to approach them in an unfamiliar manner/chase them (a little less frightening for the dogs and hopefully less work for a good citizen). Aside from being extremely functional, the tags are also aesthetically pleasing. I would definitely recommend these tags to others.;0
51251;My vet originally prescribed this. ONe one golden is a senior and had arthritis issues. With reading the amazon reviews this helped me decide to continue this product and is cheaper on Amazon than the vets. The dogs do very well and less arthritic issues.;0
87938;This slows our Beagle Lucy down when she eats. She was mad at us, at first. But then realized she didn't have a choice! It slows her down so she's not belching (so unlady like) after every meal. I have found the smaller the food bits, the slower she eats (in this bowl). She can still scoot it across the floor.;0
40017;My new puppy started barking so much we knew we needed to find something to stop it. I used this a few times and already she's not barking like she was.;0
157457;I like these clippers. I used them on a senior lab who does not like her nails touched (she chews her own and you have to finish the job for her) and they worked really well.  The blade is sharp and snips right through the nail without having to use much force.  I think they are comfortable to hold, well built and seem like they'll hold up.I was provided these clippers from the manufacturer and asked to test them out and leave a review saying what I think of them.;0
20106;I trimmed my dogs nails with  some new clippers and accidently cut too close to the quick.  I dipped her nail that was bleeding in a little of this that I put in the lid and the bleeding stopped immediately.;0
70886;It's a good thing my kitty isn't writing this review.  I think this item is adorable and it works very well at keeping herwhere I want her to be.  She doesn't think it's so hot but all kitties resist confinement.  The unit is made very well, isquick and easy to put onto the kitty and press the button and she stops.  When the button is released she is free to roamfor 10 feet.  I live in an apartment and it's imperative that kitties are kept in the apartment or under good control.  Iwould recommend this for restraining your kitty.;0
89254;"My Cats really like ""Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate 4 Flavor Seafood Variety Pack"" one of the many Flavors that I get Locally, 100% Completed and Balanced Nutrition for Adult Cats and Kittens. Great Seafood Dinners that are Formulated to meet the Nutritional Levels Established by The Association of American Feed Control Officials ""AAFCO"" I have tried to give my Cats other more Expensive Gourmet Foods from Specialty Pet-Shops or even the Pet Hospital where they have those Pricey and Tasteless Foods, thinking that my Cats would love it, been a little Finicky as they are, however, they didn't want any of that Food, they like to Eat FriskiesMy Cats always have Friskies Wet and Dry Food available to them all the time, they get tired of eating the same flavors too often so I have to try different ones all the Time. I am glad that Friskies has such Great Diversity and Variety of Flavors for me to choose from. I even Feed several Cats outside and they Love Friskies! ...Thank You D.D.";0
64243;"The ""normal strength"" version of this collar barely registered to my bulldog.  She's cross the line and sort of twitch her head like a bug had flown in her ear.  Now she flinches away when she hear the beep, and yelps if she accidentally plows through the ""beep"" range into the ""shock"" range.  She's crossed it once since I got it (to check out a yapping snack-size dog that way going by) but did NOT want to come back over the line.  She nearly yanked my arm off sprinting back towards the house when she heard the beep (I had the collar in my hand to cross back into the yard).Pros:  This shock definitely registers on my dog.Cons:  The black box on the collar is big and heavy, which doesn't matter to the dog, but it looks a little bulky if you care about aesthetics.  It's maybe 1.5""x1.5""x2.5"" (but I didn't measure so don't quote me!), in any case, it's definitely bigger than the normal sized collar.";0
73834;I have adult cats, they're totally disinterested as hard as I tried to get them interested.  I think kittens would love this however. I have the most success with adult cats by interacting with them with anything that looks like it might be a flying insect or something in the air. They seem made to chase those.;0
141903;Bacon!  My dogs love bacon!  The small size makes them the perfect training treat, easy to carry in your pocket for a quick reward.  The smell gets their attention quickly and they really want to earn that treat!  I buy all the flavors but I have only found the bacon on Amazon.;0
17838;"Along with several types of Penn Plax filters (some canisters and some internal filters), I have Eheim classic canister filters--the 2213, 2215, and 2217--on various tanks and find them all great.  They are reliable and push that water through from bottom to top.  The flow rate on Eheims is low, however, compared to Penn Plax's Cascade.  While the downside of the Cascade is that the water goes through the canister less completely because of the design, the upside is the powerful flow, which is great if you have fish that like more heavily oxygenated water and faster currents.  Another plus with the Cascade filter is that the setup is incredibly easy in comparison with the Eheim setup.  For starters, the instructions are clear unlike Eheim.  In the second place, the ""in"" and ""out"" flow is clearly marked, which is an obvious trick that Eheim should do.Each of these canisters are great, depending upon what types of critters--fish or amphibians--you are keeping.  I can not testify to longevity of either type of canister as I have had these types for under a year.  By most reports, Eheim fans swear they last forever.  However, I have not heard this about the Penn Plax Cascade.  Given the price, I suspect that it is more cheaply built and, therefore most likely, less long lasting.  I am willing to take this risk and repurchase a Penn Plax if it only lasts, let's say, 5 years or so.  I will see what happens.  Purchase if you like low prices, heavy flow rates, and are willing to take a slight risk about quality.";0
110343;i love this. use it for my 20lb cat had it for about two months on him its good quality. i did snap the bell off thou sence hes a inside/outside cat. i didnt want any animals hearing it n trying to eat him thou.;0
141244;There's no substitute for a good foundation in training, but there's also nothing wrong with having as many training tools available as possible. Remote collars got a bad rap but they've obviously come a long way. This one provides very consistent levels of low-level stimulation and has a variety of applications. While many would caution that the advertised range is probably wishful thinking, this collar does have a good range and is a great training tool, plus the remote switch for the light on the collar is a great feature, as is the waterproof construction. Highly recommend to anyone.;0
117220;I purchased 2 of these in XL for a Doberman Rescue.  The rescue loves them, and, more importantly, says the dogs love them.  I purchased two more in the XXL size for the really big Dobies the rescue sometimes gets, but for normal size Dobies, the XL was the right size.  The rescue gets a lot of Dobermans in and adopts a lot out, so I was worried about the durability of the beds, but all reports are that after a month of constant use, the beds are holding up well.;0
95867;Let me start by saying I'm not a cat person (my fiance is). So for me to spend $340 on a litter box should definitely tell you something.We've owned two Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Boxes prior to buying this Litter Robot because they were cheap and the best designed overall. My one job with our two cats is to clean up after them and I hate it. Seriously, HATE it. The Litter Robot changed my whole outlook of the cats and life! I no longer dread the mornings or coming home after work to clean up after them.Pros: Easy to setup, easy to operate, and uses less litter. $340 is pocket change for the happiness and freedom I now enjoy. In the words of Mastercard...Priceless.Cons: Cats still track litter out, but that's not about the Litter Robot itself.If you're like me and really hate cleaning up after the cats everyday (and asking others to do it too when you're away), then seriously consider the Litter Robot.Lastly, I bought it directly from LR website. Get the bubble unit, it's brighter and bigger for the cats.;0
140504;Love this stuff.  There is NOTING better than this brand of food for your dogs and cats.  Don't let your vet fool you into using Royal Canin (which has by-products in it. Ick) this stuff has made my cat's coat shiny, and she is so much happier now that she is not weighed down by crap food.;0
127577;These are my kitten's favorite toy of all time. I have all sizes and weights of ball stuff around, but these are IT! The only thing I agree with another reviewer, is that I keep track of where they are. The kitten likes to chew them, and at times they have gotten so soggy that I'm afraid she is going to swallow them. So, when used, beware of the small size being ingested by animals or babies.;0
141299;I feed them the Halo dry food in either Chicken or Salmon and they love a couple of spoonfuls mixed in with the dry food.  A little mushy, however, there are actually real pieces of turkey and real pieces of chickpea in the can... so, I can feel good about feeding them this food.  Also, from what I have researched, Halo is the only major dog food brand to never be under a recall... that counts for a lot these days!;0
118236;My kitten was spayed 2 days ago and within a couple of hours of getting home, I 2-day ordered this product.  It's soft fabric versus the plastic cone and ribbon that the vet had put on my cat.  She'll be in it for about 11 more days and I couldn't be happier.  She was falling over/getting stuck, unable to put her head down sleeping, etc in the plastic one and this rectifies the majority of those issues - she just seems more comfortable and is finally sleeping with her head down for the first time in days.  It also gives her some more space (whiskers are more comfortable it looks like) and she can better navigate.  She's not trying to get out of this one like the other and is also no longer bumping into things - I think the other really had an effect on her ability to navigate.  Great, inexpensive and effective fix if you've got a cat or kitten facing a surgery + time in a cone.;0
67539;seemed like a nice idea online, but arrived damaged, the packaging was too close to the actual product so anything that came close to penetrating the box or even mashing the box would definitely mess up the product inside;0
153862;If this is in your price range, we can whole-heartedly recommend it.Likes:- Our cats love this food.  They are particularly excited about eating since we got this.- Grain free option.  I believe a little whole grain is fine for most cats, but if your cats are having digestive issues and you want to try grain-free, this is a good option.- Density.  This grain-free food goes further.  We give our cats a little less than usual when we get this grain free stuff.Dislikes:- Price.  You pay extra for the grain free food.  Our cats really like it though.Overall highly recommended, if it is in your price range.;0
85801;My dog loves this food. It has good size chunks in different flavors or colors and is hard food, but not rock hard, because even my cats will munch on it. Over 10 years I've tried lots of different foods in my price range and this one continues to be the favcorite of my pets.;0
31131;These were the BEST THING EVER. I loved capping my kittys nails, she couldn't scratch or claw up anything....though when I put her up in my room she ripped up the carpet with them, and easily ripped them off with enough digging...I never found the little caps...made me a little worried..I'd buy them agian if I had the firval money for that.;0

149065;I bought this to supply CO2 to my planted aquarium tanks. It seemed easy to use. I set it up but it has no instructions. I found an ad for it on You Tube but no precise instructions.I had it set to supply the correct amount to my tanks and it malfunctioned after I had had it over a month. It dumped about 15# of CO2 into my Rainbowfish tank and I lost a few fish- nearly lost many more but was able to drain and refill the tank quick enough to save the fish. I still have it but I am not using it anymore with my rainbows- afraid of another malfunction. Wish I could trust it,;0

7577;Our 11 week old puppy loves his duck.  he carries it around by the neck or feet.  The toy makes a great sound...not too annoying for us as humans who have to listen to the quack, quack.  He doesn't however love it as much as his Hedge hog and Squirrels in a tree--that is his absolute favorite toy---hunting squirrels.  I guess it is because he is a hunting breed.  he is a Vizsla who will only hunt plush little squeaky squirrels.  But it is still a great toy and he does play with it a lot.;0
104263;I've had him on this food since he was seven weeks old and he is responding wonderful to it. His stool is solid. His energy levels are extremely high. He looks healthy in every way. His coat is beautiful. He also loves the way it tastes. I don't add anything to it. My puppy is a chocolate lab.;0
106934;These bully sticks were a good price and good quality. My dog loves them and only gets them when she is in the crate.;0
134908;After looking at numerous types of pet stairs we decided on these ones because they were fairly cheap, high enough to reach our bed or at least higher than most other stairs available. These do seem like they are made of low quality materials but they hold up to a good amount of weight. Our chihuahua only weighs 6lbs but my fiance and I have both stepped on these without problems. So I can vouch for them holding at least 130-140lbs.;0
70033;Received this item and the battery cover was off.  When setting it up, battery cover hardly wants to stay on.  Used a piece of tape.The suction cup to hold the unit to the aquarium glass is a joke.  It won't even stick by itself.Accuracy seems to be OK.  Checked with a few other thermometers.;0
119497;I didn't come across the dust issues that some of the other reviewers had. However, I DO take the litter out to the garage to clean, so maybe that is why.What surprises me most about this litter is that I really don't smell the litterbox at all when I use it. I may even switch to this one permanantly.I bought this litter at Costco, and wasn't really expecting much from it. I was pleasantly surprised that that it worked just as well as thePrecious Cat Ultra Premium Clumping Cat Litter, 40 pound bagI normally buy at Petsmart.The perfume smell is not as shocking as some of the reviewers say. I have a very sensitive nose, and the fact it didn't bother me says a lot. I usually sprinkle Arm & Hammer Cat Litter Deodorizer, with Baking Soda in bottom of the litterbox anyway, and this litter definitely does not smell nearly as strong as that.My kitten isn't picky about litters, and he seems to be fine with this one.All that said, i agree with the bad packaging--- it is just way too heavy, which would be fine, but it has no handle and there is no way to hang on to it when carrying it. It really should be made in smaller packages or have some sort of handle.;0
89684;Our puppy loves these treats!  We break them in half so hue grey last even longer.  He loves all of his Zukes treats and we love that they are made with wholesome ingredients.;0
60343;Bought these to use for outdoor feral cats that visit our home at dinner times. We coated the feet in waterproof paint so that we could place the feet in water to keep the ants from finding their food. We use plastic butter tubs for dishes which fit in the holes. They're just the right height for the large male cats who tend to hunker down when eating and are also just the right size for smaller cars who stand up while eating.;0
157828;Good Retractable Dog Leash. I would not use it on a large dog.. but a small to medium dog would be fine with this. This product is nicely constructed and it retracts smoothly. I am very pleased with its performance. I used it on my 75 dog, but he is older and slower and would never bold or even move very quickly, at least not these days. So, again, I would NOT recommend it for most large dogs.I would however recommend it for small to medium dogs and have already recommended it to friends.;0
145224;We bought the medium for our two large indoor cats. They like to sleep together, and it is a good size for that. It comes with a lot of stuffing, so the bottom was domed up too much for them. I removed some stuffing so it was flatter, the cats seemed to like that better. For a heavier dog that would probably not be an issue.We have it outside our bedroom door, they do not sleep with us because they get the 1am crazies. All winter and most of the summer they can be found in their bed in the morning.This has a sheet of metalized plastic under the pillow covering and this reflects infra-red heat. This is like the material used in birthday balloons and space blankets. This works much better for cats and dogs than for humans. Humans and horses are the two sweatiest animals on Earth, so plastic sheets quickly makes us wet with perspiration. Cats and dogs only sweat a little from their paw pads so this is not an issue.;0
2354;My orthopedist suggested I take this product as I have osteoarthritis and the joints in my hands hurt.  I have just begun, so I cannot critique the product as yet.;0
132522;This item was really great for my 85 pound Malamute who LOVES to explore on walks, doesn't get tangled and is a strong durable weight. Then I decided to try it out on my 90 pound German Shepherd puppy who isn't to great on the lease, well he hit the end of the extension at full speed a few times and to my surprise the leash still didn't break. Such good quality it's worth an extra few dollars.;0
69394;biggest and best tug - hard to find tugs this size - am ordering additional tugs - great buy!! recommend;0
156139;Testing this product was a stretch for me, since I generally do not buy dog treats that are made with chicken or are chicken-flavored. My four dogs do not share my concerns, and three of them seem to think that these treats were sent from doggie Heaven. Of course, they ate them so quickly, I'm not so sure if they even knew what they tasted like. The fourth is more of a gourmet, and took her time with the Jerky Snack, eventually finishing it. Was that a smile on her face or a burp of contentment? We may never know, but we do know our dogs won't say &#34,no&#34, to Waggin Train Smoky Jerky Treats, and they seem to be a better choice than most chicken treats available.;0

68355;My parrotlet likes this toy and is starting to play with it.  It isn't particularly delicate and I think it will hold up well until it is destroyed (as bird toys are meant to be shredded!)  I think it could be a little bit larger because it really is quite small but the medium is WAY too large for the parrotlet sized bird.  I'm satisfied with the purchase overall.;0
75110;My bird adores this mirror--or should I say, looking at himself in this mirror!  He just chirps and taps at himself in it for minutes at a time.  It is very easy to install, I would recommend this product.  Oh and for size/reference sake, my little bird is a cockatiel.;0
20517;I ordered the small size, because the Amazon page says that's for small dogs under 25 pounds.  My cocker spaniel is 20 pounds, so well under 25 pounds.  The small size did not fit her well.  The loop for the snout was too small.  I had it at the maximum  circumference and it was a stretch to pull it to the base of her nose as instructed.  I had to return it and buy the medium size.  That was much better.Once I had the correct size, everything was great.  My dog did a little dance to try to rub the collar off, but she quickly got used to it.  We were ready to walk almost immediately.  I was surprised by how much more control I had over her.  It's like she knew who was boss without me saying a word.  She doesn't pull, she obeys my commands.  Even when she doesn't, I am able to get her attention more easily.My dog chases my cat.  I'm working very hard to curtail that.  With this head collar, I'm able to take her around the house with me without her pulling to get at the cat.  The few times she's jumped at the cat, she immediately realized she couldn't and would just sit.Great product.  I will be bringing my dog to training and hoping this head collar will make my work easier.  It already has.;0
86105;Ever since the pet food recall that happened a few years back I have been super careful which dog foods I buy. I have a 10 year old GSD and now a 5 month old Red Healer pup and both have sensitive stomachs. I've tried other brands of canned dog foods and they seem to enjoy them pretty well, except it really doesn't sit well with their stomachs. So, I happy to be feeding Natural Balance canned food, because here it is larger packages than the local pet store & the price is more what I can afford. I mix half a can in each bowl with some dry dog food and they both love it.I love the not having to drive across town & carry around heavy cans of dog food. :);0
120779;This has been a HUGE help.  I have a 14yo husky with limited mobility/spinal arthritis who uses a ramp to get in/out of the car.  I had a hammock on the seat so he couldn't fall, but he would lose his footing regardless when turning around or stepping on the unsupported portion.  This has provided a much more firm surface and he is less wobbly when riding/turning around.  It's still a bit slippery for him (probably wouldn't be an issue for the average dog), so I have attached a beach towel on top of it using velcro.  Was easy to install and seems sturdy/durable.  Just for reference, I have a subaru impreza wagon and it fits well.UPDATE:  I'm knocking one star off after using this for awhile.  Depending on how it fits in your car, be aware that it is possible for your dogs legs to fall down between the car door and the side of this.  My dog had this happen while I was driving and I had to pull off the highway to get him freed.  Might not be a bad idea to stuff a towel along the sides if there is even a small gap.;0
106404;Cute toy, and I thought my laser-beam obsessed kitties would enjoy it, but no go.  They look at the lights if I trigger it myself, but don't get the concept that they can turn it on themselves.  I think a (human) toddler might actually enjoy this more than a kitty.;0
123372;I think dispenser is a great concept.  However, I haven't found any treats that work well in it.  Either way too many come out if using the small Zeke's treats, or if you use larger treats you have to shake the dispenser to get them out.  Neither is ideal or convenient.If anyone has the ideal size treat to use with this dispenser, let me know!;0
92573;This stuff does as it says.  My dog sheds way less now (not totally gone) and her coat is much more silky and soft.  The issue I have with it and reason I gave it only three stars is that the I had to send the stuff back three times to get a product that didn't dome open during shipment.  They send this stuff via air and the seals and lids do not protect against the super low air pressure and freezing at higher altitudes, thus, open containers and an oily mess when opening.

36392;We have made it a point not to give our dogs animal rawhides as they are not that great for their tummies.  Typically, we will buy a bone (yes, actual animal bone) and let them gnaw on that.  So now we have about 20 bones for our two dogs as they stand up fairly well and just don't go away.I was looking for a alternative to the bone, yet not quite as simple as a dog biscuit (which are gone in seconds!!).  These sweet potato rawhides are great!!  It took the dogs about 10 minutes to get through one and they seemed to really enjoy them.;0

They put a paw inside the tunnel to push the ball. That pops the top part off, and the ball gets out. They play with the ball just like any $0.25 pingpong ball. It disappears under the couch.At the $15 price, I don't think it should pop apart so quickly (first day, and everyday since).At $49 it would be over,over,over priced.Although the cats like it and play with it daily, I don't like that I have to put it back together a few times each day.I am not going to return it because it is too much trouble.;0

121111;"These steps are going to please or frustrate and it depends upon your dog. I have a 14 yr old Lasa and these steps work really well for her. HOWEVER, it took patience and training to get her comfortable with them. As several 1 star reviews point out, these steps are soft foam and give somewhat when the dog goes up and down, especially if the dog goes slowly or stops to contemplate the endeavor. Nevertheless, once my pooch began to go up and down at normal speed, they don't give so much and work like a charm. She is happily able to get up on our bed by herself again. (Good for her and good for us).So why not make them harder? Well, the other night I kicked the stairs with my bare foot. I thought, ""wow that would have hurt if they weren't foam"". So I am one of those who are pleased. My dog is 9 lbs. and fairly adaptable. If this is the case with your little guy, you will probably be pleased as well.Other notes: The steps are lower than expected. There is protective plastic under the cover that should be removed as it is noisy. The steps come with two washable faux lambskin covers.";0

I noticed that the packaging stated several times that &#34,white flakes&#34, would come off the collar but not be worried so that wasn't an issue for me.  The flakes were almost wax like, but smelled very good. The collar was definately big enough for my dog.  Unfortunately the collar didn't seem to work at all. My basset was still as high strung as ever.  It was only my first time using it, so I will continue to use it again, but not sure it is going to help.;0
12786;While I have to agree with many reviewers who commented on the large size of the bowls (they really are better suited for dogs), in my case they are going to be just fine.I am currently feeding any number of stray cats in my neighborhood and this set- up is working out very well, so far. The bowl is large enough so that I only have to set out food once a day or two, and there is plenty of room for a generous amount of water.Since it's winter, I can't give you a 100% guarantee on the ant situation.  But the fact that it is designed so that you pour water in the narrow moat surrounding the food bowls, satisfies by belief that ants will go to their watery grave before getting to the food as well as giving me a decent trail to follow back to destroy their nest. Most important is that the cats will have clean food and water to enjoy.;0

397634;I wasn't sure if I was going to like Tom Violet very much when I began this book but once I got past the first chapter he began to grow on me. Until in the end, I was a little bit in love with him. Tom is a guy going through some career, relationship and family challenges. He is an aspiring writer and has finished his first novel but is living in the shadow of his Pulitzer winning author father. I enjoyed the development of the father son relationship...very funny at times but ultimately moving and satisfying.I can see where the Jonathon Tropper comparisons come from, both writers write with a very male sensibility, both write with wit, insight and heart. I wouldn't say whether one is better than the other because I enjoy them both but I'd say that Matthew Norman's style is less brutal than Tropper's. Loved this one.;1
582708;It is seldom that I leave a book without having finished it. It seemed to me to be extremely repetitive. John Self is (ha ha) an egotist advertisement-director Britishman who travels to the US to negotiate his first major film.

Amis can write and has a good sense of humor, but the story goes nowhere. Maybe other books by him are better.;1
209552;&amp,#65279,I walked into the bookstore one day and saw a book with Peyton Manning on the cover and decided to read it.  I thought most of it would be about Peyton, since he is in the spotlight right now, but I was pleasantly surprised to get a lot of information about Archie also.I am younger myself so I was too young to follow football a lot when Archie was in his prime, but I found his stories very interesting.  When I told my wife how Archie's father had died she asked me why I would want to read something that depressing.  After finishing the book I made a point of telling her that Archie obviously did not like what happened, but that he turned it into a positive.  From reading this book I turned into a fan of Archie Manning.I was already a fan of Peyton Manning when I picked up this book and now I am a bigger fan.  It is nice to have an athlete in our day that respects others.  He looks up to the great quarterbacks before him and really admires his dad.  It was nice to read a clean autobiography, in which Peyton most embarrassing admission was the mooning incident.The one drawback to the book that I saw was that there was not enough information on the other boys.  I understand that most people will read the book because of Peyton and Archie, but it would have been nice to know a little more about the others.;1
216770;"I love this period in history for a romance.  This book had a good plot but the story was just dull.  The writer seems to lack creativity.  When she used the word ""great"" as in "" his great head"" and ""his great thigh""'  multiple times, I realized how bad it was and just stopped reading.";1
255266;I checked this book out of the library, as I do most diet books.  However, the time has come to return it, and I don't want to.  This book, for me, is worth buying.I understand the range of reviews on this book from same old thing to greatest ever.  This is not a diet book.  This is more of a how to maintain a desired weight or Body Mass Index (BMI) for the rest of your life book.  Therefore it's not as exciting as diet books that promise massive weight loss fast.  In fact, because it recommends moderate weight loss slowly, my husband wasn't interested in it.  I imagine that he feels like many people.  First he wants to lose a lot of weight, then he'll consider reading something like this book to maintain his weight.I'm in a different place.  By using Martha Beck's 4 Day Win for the past three years, I've been doing 10% drops through BMIs without realizing that's what was happening.  I'd lose some weight, hold out there for a while, lose some more, and continue the process.  I've been steadily moving down through BMIs without realizing I was following the process recommended in Break Through Your Set Point.  I'm now trying to get the last 5 pounds off.  The last 5 pounds move me to down to yet another lower BMI level,  and they haven't been easy to get off.  After reading this book, I realize that in order to get to the next BMI, I'm going to have to tweak my exercise and eating habits once more.  It's as if ever lower BMI requires another new set of tricks and habits to coax the weight off.I highly recommend this book for a description of behaviors that can help one move down through BMIs and permanently estalbish a new lower weight.  I know slow is boring, but the fact that the loss is permanent is exciting.For women, I also recommend Debra Waterhouse's Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell.  Her book nicely compliments this book as to why women's bodies want to hold onto extra fat (fat acts as a hormone and augments estrogen production as our ovaries produce less).  Her book also provides thoughts on tweaking eating and exercising.Between Martha, George & Debra, I'm doing pretty good.;1
635925;I picked the English edition of this book up in London two weeks ago (it's Number Four on their best-seller list now). As a student of the Battle of Britain, this book was a real treat. I read it in conjunction with &quot,Fighter Boys&quot, (out now) and found the two works complimented each other very well. Wellum was the youngest operational Spitfire pilot in combat during the Battle, and his accounts of training and flying combat missions in the fall of 1940 are first-rate. His description of flying head-on into a formation of Heinkel 111 is the stuff of adventure novels -- only these events really happned and he lived to tell the tale.The book falters a little toward the end. Although there are clues given that Wellum was sufferering from combat exhaustion, he tends to gloss over that portion of his service. The book ends rather abuptly as well. This is a shame because the bio tells us Wellum went on as a test pilot for Hawker Typhoons and Meteor jets. Given the author's success in detailing flying sequences, I would have loved to read more about his adventures in the cockpits of these rare airplanes.;1

We may agree on different angles or interpretations in our understanding of it, but I just leave this with you. Our Lord spoke about it in a very unfunny manner. He wept over communities going to judgment. He prayed in Gethsemane with strong crying and tears because He knew about all these realities for which He has provided a way of escape.All in this book is very hard to believe, from the moment on where he made certain statements, I felt guided from God to put this book down and not read it to the end.;1
1462;I was really eager to read this book after seeing all the great reviews for it.  However,  I started reading it and could not get into it.  The whole first half dragged for me, with not too much going on in the story. The writing was difficult to read at times, and I agree with some of the reviewers here, it often read as a screenplay which made it that much harder to get into.  But about halfway through the book, the plot starts moving and I actually end up finishing the book and I'm glad I did.  I'm still not sure why the book itself is getting rave reviews, but I am looking forward to seeing how the movie version of the book will turn out.;1
349949;I must have bought this book as a mistake. Sorry but I just dont get this type of novel.;1
314097;I really enjoyed this book, in that it tells the story of those who are passionate about magic (conjuring that is), including those who take place in competitions, those who have devoted their lives to mastering skills, and of course those who practice sleight of hand to (ahem) cheat in three card monte and other scams.The book really is fascinating autobiography of a physics grad student who loves magic, with quite a bit of history (the magician who fooled Houdini) and travel through the current world of magic and its obsessed devotees.  For me, the most interesting chapter of the book covered a nearly blind card magician who has an almost supernatural ability to manipulate cards based on his sense of touch. The chapter tells of the author's encounters with him, describing seemingly magical effects, and includes really interesting information on studies of the role of touch and how one sense develops when others are limited.  some interesting science!The book is a very enjoyable and easy read that will appeal to a lot of people,. Even if you don't have a lot of interest in doing magic (and this book reveals few tricks), you will learn a lot about an interesting group of people and also a lot of history and psychology. An easy five stars!;1
549506;The novel All Quiet on the Western Front depicts the battle of the Germans during World War I. It is narrated by Paul Baumer, a twenty year old German, and reveals the events that take place during he and his comrades lives as they fight the war.  Unfortunately, the young men soon have to deal with combat wounds, killed friends, and despair.  The men are frequently presented with so many indicences of death before they have even really begun to live their lives.This novel tells the story of World War I from the German perspective.  Although the Germans were thought of as the &quot,enemies&quot, to almost half of the world during the war, I did not see them as such as I was reading this novel.  Instead, they just seemed like regular soliders that did not really have a choice about their involvement in the war.  They felt no real glory for being soliders and their only desire was to remain alive.One of the key themes that I though was apparent in the novel is that war is an inhumanity for both sides, there are really no &quot,good and bad&quot, guys when it comes to the soliders that are fighting.  All soliders are just fighting and killing because they do not have a choice to do otherwise.  This theme can be seen by Paul's willingness to give food to Russian prisoners, and the gulit that he feels after taking the life of an ally solider.I found the writing style of Remarque appealing.  Although I cannot tell how much of the style of the novel was lost in translation, I can say that I found the English translation very straightforward and unadorned.  Yet, the sentences still had a certain charm to them and were never banal (as I have often found Hemmingway's to be).  Remarque's style reminded me a little of Crane's The Red Badge of Courage.  But All Quiet on the Western Front is by far the better book.  Its prose flows freely and it is quite a page turner.If you are at all interested in war stories, I would reccommend reading All Quiet on the Western Front.  I warn you that it is by not means an uplifting book and that it can be very graphic at times.  But if you would like to experience a first hand account of World War I from the German side then you should read this book.  It is the anti-war book for all wars.;1

317329;"I was thrilled to have a chance to review an early copy of Christopher Moore's Sacre Bleu. Having thoroughly enjoyed Bite Me, You Suck, Practical Demonkeeping, The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove, Moore is one of the few writers whose work I truly look forward to.After the first 100 pages of Sacre Bleu, I'd wondered though if I'd fallen into another Fool - Moore's most disappointing effort to date. Other than a handful of eye poppers like ""just licked the devil's ass to chase all taste of goodness from his tongue"" I was finding the setting of late 19th century French impressionist painters to be honestly unreadable. While there were subtle and tantalizing hints that something more fun was to come, it was a slow trek through fictional backstories around famous (and not so famous) paintings by Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, Renoir, Pissarro, Manet, Monet, and others to get there. And the occasional reprint of photos of some of the pictures themselves added nothing.But, when Moore finally hits his mark and unveils Blue, a beautiful muse who has inspired artists for millennia, her shadowy partner and tormentor, the story and characters come to life in the crazy way that is unique to Moore.If you liked Fool, you can ignore this review because I'm sure you'll love this. If you liked the rest of Moore's earlier works, this isn't quite up to his classics I mentioned first but it's good enough and still likely one of the funniest and most original novels you'll read this year.";1
166296;I really don't know if I liked this book or not.  I got it in audiobook form and was so distracted by the author's monotone reading that I missed most of the storyline.  Authors should not read their own material.  It takes an actor to make a book come to life.;1
628349;Such corruption.  Such ruthlessness.  I love this book because I find the good guys so boring, and here we have perfectly delicious bad guys and gals doing horrible things to each other.I've recommended this book to people, and only a couple have enjoyed it, but the others tend to read bodice rippers, and this one has sex and intrigue, but not in the typical way.If you want fun and love among the ruins of an innocent's life, this is your book.;1
503250;Another great book by lemony snicket. Leaves more clues and mysterious suspense. I keep getting mad that Mr. Poe is such an idiot;1
44834;"I haven't looked at the other reviews. I read this book because I've recently finished ""One Hundred Names for Love,"" by Diane Ackerman, Paul West's wife. I had not heard of him before. He suffered a massive stroke in 2003. This book was written about 7 years prior to that event.West uses a stream of consciousness and switches (by chapter) from one character to another. There are two main characters: George, ""The Place In Flowers Where Pollen Rests""  his name, and his son/nephew, ""Beautiful Badger Going Over the Hill,"" otherwise known as Oswald. The first half of the book shows the uncle and nephew relationship. George is old, living on the reservation where he has a permanent place by a wall for he attracts tourists. He is known far and wide for his kachina doll carvings. These dolls are derived from the characters of the gods who reside on the San Francisco Mountains. Twice a year, tribal men dress up and play the part of a particular god but not as an actor. The intention is to become the god which allows that god to visit the tribe. The same gods do not show up every year. As the story unfolds, we see that Oswald doesn't have a solid footing in the tribe, mainly because he is a bastard. After George's wife was mysteriously drowned, George wooed his older brother's wife and Oswald was the result.The book begins with Oswald fleeing his pornography film when an actress is accidentally killed. Oswald fears he will be blamed. Nobody in the tribe knows he acts in pornography. He describes Western movies when asked. This is not an easy book to understand. Oswald is a conflicted character and so is George. Both have many layers. George has never told Oswald he is his father. If Oswald didn't take care of George, supplyng him with diabetes, heart medication, George would die. But George wants to die, and periodically enacts his death, not deliberately but because he is TRYING to die. It is not an easy matter. Oswald fights George to stay alive, coaxing, cajoling, always patient with him. Oswald admires George because George doesn't kowtow to anyone. The interest derives from how these two understand and do not understand each other.In the second half of the book, George has died. The chapters that used to belong to George are taken up by the god Sotugnangu, who reports on Oswald's going to Viet Nam and what he experiences there. This is a dark and brutal section of the book. Oswald resorts to taking body parts of the slain to make an entity. His fellow soldiers are wary of him. Oswald eventually disposes of his Frankestein and I could not figure out if he were imaginging himself being like George in this activity or what. He is NOT a vampire.Oswald returns to the village on the mesa. Oswald's background is covered. We go into the mind of his mother, her memories of George. Because Oswald is the youngest child, his older brothers taunt him, knowing George is his father and their father leaves, building himself another house. So, Oswald, not a member of the inner circle of men who meet in the Kiva, decides or is compelled by a mysterious visitation to enact the part of a god. He studies an image of this god in a book of kachina dolls and makes himself up. He sallies out and enacts this god's temperament in the village. Even those who did not give their approval comment and recognize the god. This I understood as a major breakthrough for Oswald, for he is doing a traditionally approved activity and the writing suggests that he does well enough to be recognized. This god is one who has not been seen for a long time. The women and chidren and others interact with him in his costume. The men play the ""gods"" must exit and disrobe out of sight, which Oswald does. His mother sees him after he has disrobed and is estatic that he has participated. I took this as meaning that Oswald will do this again in six months, that he has found a calling, something he needed to do.The writing is not dense but intense. I liked the book because I'm fascinated with Hopi culture and was placated by the ending. I was puzzled many times during the reading, but would recommend it as worth the effort.";1
318439;This is the latest spin off book from Jeaniene Frost in her Night Huntress World and it is focuses on Mencheres. In all the books we have seen him in the past, he seems to be sad and unhappy with his life. I guess I never really thought about it before, but he has been alive for thousands of years, most of them he spent married to a woman who hated him. If that wasn't bad enough, she also tried to kill him and his line out of fear. This resulted in him having to put actions into place to kill off his own wife and now the guilt he feels is overpowering him. He has thousands of years of blood on his hands, no wife, and while he is surrounded by people who respect him, there is not really a whole lot of love in his life.Enter Kira, she happens to stumble upon Mencheres being attacked by ghouls (though she does not know that) and tries to help him. She ends up getting hurt in the battle and Mencheres has to heal her, during the process Mencheres also realizes she has seen to much and takes her with him to wipe her memory. This turns out to be a problem because he cannot seem to do it and so Kira stays with him a while. While time goes by Kira's attraction to Mencheres grows and soon she finds she may not want to leave even if she can.The emotion that took me by surprise the most in this book was Mencheres' sadness, well really it is depression. It is always present as the book evolves and he is constantly trying to talk Kira out of being around him. He feels like his life has been to full of pain and suffering and he does not deserve her in his life. Kira does not want to hear it though, she is judging him for what he is now, not where his past actions led him. Which you have to admit is a lot easier said than done. That is how people should look at others, but it rarely actually happens. It is almost a blessing that she did not know Mencheres before though because she essentially gives him a clean slate to start over with her.I love Kira, she is tough, strong willed, and not afraid to fight for what she wants. She is also not afraid to stand up for Mencheres which is a rare event in the vampire world. He has made a lot of enemies and not everyone trusts him. Even some of his closest friends throw insults his way. They are probably meant to be in jest, but they still affect him and Kira sees it. She does not care about what they think they know about him because she has undying faith in him and she is proud to stand by him. I found that quality in her quite admirable and it was refreshing to see Mencheres get a fair shot at things. Sure, he has done a lot of things in his past, but doesn't everyone deserve a second chance? I think so, and that is what Kira is for him.Bones and Cat make a couple brief appearances in this one, which I love. I also liked seeing Cat and her brief interaction with Kira. Cat is one bad a$% chick, if I ran into her I know I would be intimidated. But Kira holds her ground with Cat and does not seem to be intimidated at all. It was quite impressive and knocked Kira up a notch in my book. I hope we get to see her again in the future Cat and Bones stuff. Oh, even Vlad comes into play a couple of times, I miss that guy. I know he is supposed to be scary and what not, but he is one of my favorites. I hope we get to see a spin off book with him in it because that would be really interesting.Overall, this book was fantastic. I loved getting to know Mencheres better and I feel like I understand him more now. In the past books I have not really taken to him, but this book changed my mind. Once again Jeaniene has managed to keep me completely engrossed in her world and I loved every minute of it :);1
381514;Fun, fast moving,  interesting characters.  I can't wait to start the next book.  Similar reading experience and story line to Hunger games, but different enough to be a fresh story.;1
148831;Our old friends Lucy and Edmund Pevensie join their nerdy cousin Eustace, in this book, in a journey through a portrait of a ship, to the seas off the coast of Narnia.  There, they meet their old friend Prince Caspian, who is adventuring across the seas to explore the far reaches of his world.  He is also searching for a group of lost nobility from Narnia, who apparently had been marooned on various Narnian islands years before.  They all travel from island to island, and have many challenging adventures.Of all the Narnia books, this is probably the one where C.S. Lewis gave himself the most freedom to just tell a story, without being &quot,in-your-face&quot, about the allegorical meanings of everything.  There IS a lot of allegory, but he makes it part of a story here, rather then constructing a story just as an excuse to make up a context for an allegory.  It's a terrific tale for children or adults.  Absolutely two thumbs up.I just want to recommend a few books, for anyone who may be curious about what sources C.S. Lewis drew upon for this story.  I'll let you discover them for yourself, but the titles are: &quot,Phantom Islands of the Atlantic,&quot, by Donald S. Johnson, and &quot,New Worlds, Ancient Texts&quot, by Anthony Grafton.  Also -- if anyone's interested in learning about the cultural context of C.S. Lewis' personal problems with science education, which are pretty obvious in the way he talks about Eustace, then I recommend looking at &quot,The Two Cultures&quot, by C.P. Snow.  You'll see what I mean.;1
409759;Hercule Poirot is one of the best detectives to ever come to life from an authors imagination!

352279;Once again I was extremely happy to get the next book in this series. I am a huge fan of the series and the story. The story continues were we last left off with all the old and new characters. Four (John), Six, Seven (Marina), Ten (Ella), Nine and Eight are all present in The Rise of Nine. The book concentrates on POV's from Four, Six and Seven throughout the books jumping back and forth. Each POV also has a distinct font to know when they have switched POVs. This is extremely helpful, so one doesn't get lost.The Rise of Nine did fall a little short for me then I Am Number Four and The Power of Six. There was just a different tempo in this installment. I felt at time there could have been less mentions of thoughts or ideas and more action. I love this series for the intense action and suspense and about a little more than half-way is when I was given that. The first half, felt it drag just a little in some places. I had a feeling this might happen since there was a change in the writers. Many of you should know that Pittacus Lore is a 2 person writing team. One of the original writers left during the process of The Power of Six. So The Rise of Nine from the beginning was created by the new writing team. That being said, I still thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and didn't want to put it down.I really can't get to into what takes place in The Rise of Nine without spoiling many parts of the story. Just know that Four is there doing what Four does best with Bernie Kosar at his side. Six is back also trying to find Four like they promised they would from the last book. Marina (Seven) and Ella (Ten) are also very present and have been thrown into the fight head on. Then you have crazy Nine and possibly Eight you'll meet. More chests will be found and open to see what they contain. The Mogs are strong as ever and you wouldn't believe who is helping them. You will be taken to several parts of the planet in all the adventures. Then when you have reached the end, you will be left with your mouth open with the ending. I will say this, with an ending like that one knows there is more coming in future books.I highly recommend this series, if you watched the movie and never read any of the books, don't judge the story by that movie. The movie doesn't come close to how great the books are. Grab which ever copy you need to read and you will be a fan of Lorien Legacies. - Yara;1

80971;Anyone can easily identify with this book, which finds words to convey the magic and wonder that is felt before the arrival of a baby.  Told from a grandmother's point of view, it honors children and shows the connection and sense of wonderment we have for them before their arrival, and once they are born.  The art is perfectly matched to the lyrical text and I noticed the added bonus of each text page being a different pastel color. I will keep this book in mind the next time I hear a pregnancy announced.;1
94906;It's Christmas Eve and a stone cold winter season besides.  Kincaid and Gemma are taking the children to a visit his parents' home for holiday.Kincaid's sister Juliet, waiting for his arrival, and beginning a contracting career, finds the mummy of an infant in the masonry of the building she is renovating.The story takes off from there, involving family members.  Kincaid's son Kit is featured strongly in this issue of Deborah Crombie's competent mystery.  Her description of England's cold weather is great.  We finally get to know Kincaid's family better.  It is indeed a eye-opening experience for all.Kincaid and Gemma take a relucant backseat in this investigation but are prominently featured.  It's nice to see Kincaid having to bite the bullet where control is concerned.  The book alludes to the last book and you can somewhat keep up with the past events.I have enjoyed all Ms. Crombie's mysteries.  She is not British but you would never know it if you didnt read the backcover.  Well worth the read.;1

That being said, after reading Mr. Fuhrman's book and reading allot of other material, I am convinced there is a strong possibility that Michael Schiavo has committed a crime. There is at least enough circumstantial evidence to raise questions and there should have been a thorough investigation and Michael Schiavo should have been compelled to answer questions. Mark Fuhrman does a first rate investigation and he should be applauded.Great book.;1
186317;This is a fascinating examination of the literature on how technology and knowledge survived and developed throughout the periods we call the Dark Ages and the Middle Ages. It is well footnoted and documented. The authors help us understand that the Dark Ages were not as dark as we may have learned in school and that the entire 1000 period between the fall of the Roman Empire and the Enlightenment involved clear stages of growth and development.At times the detail in the book can make it slow going, but over all it is well written and easier than many historical works to plough through.This book provides the most comprehensive look into European conditions and science from 500 - 1500 AD that I've seen. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in history.;1

All the libraries in the world put together fall short in the accumulation of knowledge versus what there is, yet to be discovered.

458399;Neil Gaiman seems to be a very comfortable author. Whether he is writing books for children, teens, or adults, his books always have something others don't offer: a spectacular imagination. His books for younger readers would be great read-alouds for parents and children as they always have a fairytale quality to them...close enough to reality to be believeable, but with enough mystery and magic thrown in that they are obviously fictional.Fortunately, the Milk has a fun cover illustration that could be appealing to both girls and boys, and once the cover is cracked open, you probably won't be able to stop reading until the story is finished. Even then, your mind might return to the pages of this book to ponder what other journeys the absentminded father portrayed in its pages might encounter were his family to run out of bread, or butter.This book is filled with enjoyable fonts and wonderful illustrations that will capture your attention from the get-go. I can also see reluctant readers being more apt to pick up this title, since it has such a colorful and jaunty dust jacket. Whether young or old, this story will leave you wondering what really happened on that day when mum went to a conference, and father set out to fetch the milk.www.compassbookratings.com;1

387856;This one hooked me when I read the blurb and decided to give it a whirl.  I am a sucker for unique backdrops and world-building which is what drew me to the genres who specialize in this.  This book did not disappoint in that area.  But there was also the additional draws of romance, intrigue dystopian, and paranormal elements.This story was interesting in that the background introductory information was left until after the story got into full swing and then the information was trickled as needed instead of one massive info dump.  In the end, there were still portions that were left vague- purposefully I think as I saw hints that there are big revelations to come.Now, about the story-Simon Smith has been a witch hunter for a long time.  He is more Lone Ranger in his hunting style. He has a bitter attitude times ten on this particular night fueled by the pain from his deteriorating body and because he has been called back to his home turf to which he would have avoided forever if given a choice.  He has been assigned to find and bag the sister of a witch so that she can be used to find her brother.  Knowing that he will be deceiving the girl to get her to cooperate in something that can only lead to her brother's death does not set well with him though he is committed to the notion that all witches must die.Simon is part of an universal church organization that sprung up after the devastating earthquakes along the main fault lines that left the world particularly that of New Seattle as it is now.  Witches were held responsible for this natural disaster and the witch hunts of old are back in vogue.  Simon's group or missionaries as they are called actively seek out witches and put them to death.  Now a powerful coven of witches has sprung up in New Seattle and this Caleb Leigh, brother of Jessica Leigh is their only lead.New Seattle is an ironic name for something that is not all that is pristine and new.  If you live in the soaring skyscrapers and world of light above as the wealthy do, it is like that, but if you are poor or average you live in the dark and dingy world built on the rubble of the old city beneath that never really sees the daytime sky and you must scrape for survival.  And even lower than this are the dangerous and truly dark unstable levels of the original city and the areas near the great chasm where the fault opened- where people go and never return.Simon finds his prey, Jessica Leigh, and he is harsh with her because of his own inner uneasiness about the assignment and because he can see that she is full of light and goodness and this will all devastate her.  He tries to remain detached with the 'get her, give her over to the mission and get out' plan.  But instead, he is ordered to continue to use her and he himself is under scrutiny.  By now, Simon is quite the opposite of detached and does the unthinkable- he starts to care.Jessie has been on the run all her life because she is a witch.  She hides what she is and hides well, but the witch hunter finds her and keeps her from escaping him.  He doesn't want her, he wants Caleb.  Jessie lost track of Caleb, but can't believe he is involved in a dark coven or all the ritual killings that Simon accuses him of being.  Stuck with no other alternative, Jessie partners with Simon to find Caleb planning to deal with escape when she can get to her brother.  But things start happening.  Witches are after her and most terrifying of all a tentative relationship springs up between her and the witch hunter that would see her dead if he knew what she was.It was a mad rush from beginning to end with that whole Sword of Damocles feel to it as Jessie waits to see if she will escape with Caleb before or after Simon learns that she is a witch.  Both of them are well aware that their relationship doesn't stand a chance.  For Simon, its because he's going to kill her brother and leave her behind.  I loved the feeling of reading along about Simon and Jessie's adventures with the rare dip into what is going on with Caleb and knowing that there are bigger things going on in the shadows than any of them really know.  Even when the story finished with its slam bang finish, I was aware due to the foreshadowing throughout the book that bigger stuff is yet to come.  Yes, it is a heady feeling going into a new series that leaves me jittery and eager like that.The characters were great.  I loved them even though Simon's behavior with Jessie was parts jerk and pig.  Let's just say Simon's character had the biggest growth arc of all and it was fascinating following along as he did slowly, but surely grow.  Jessie was a strong and solid character from the get-go.  She was my hero.  That girl had a real tough row to hoe and she just did it without whining or whoosing out.  The secondary characters which amounted to members of Simon's team, the mysterious character who rescued Simon and Jessie (won't say more about this individual for spoiler reasons), Caleb and the bad guys were all of interest in their own ways.  I have a feeling I will meet many of them again.  Caleb was a character for which I felt conflicted much like Jessie.  I really couldn't give him over to being a complete villain, but yet he wasn't hero-stuff either.I am definitely eager to read more of this series and that's the best compliment I can give this story.  I think this has a wide range of appeal because of the way it crosses a few different genres- paranormal and dystopian romance along with a dash of romantic suspense.;1

262515;This book was a gripping read.  For anyone who is a dog lover it is a must, although I kind of wondered at just how smart these dogs were.  The human characters were clearly and interestingly drawn.  There was rather too much detail about the dog-training and some disbelief that they could read facial expressions and respond to small gestures and body movements.I did read it almost non-stop and the story was riveting.;1
503704;"The last book of the Chronicles of Narnia, both published and in chronological order, is the Last Battle, the Narnia series answer to the End of the World, where everything finally comes to a head, and the story is finished at last.  However, although no book in this series is really all that bad, I think that this book may be my second least favorite of the series.I have three reasons for not liking this book as much as some of the others.  The first is that in this book, there are still creatures in Narnia after the final judgment.  I know they're ment to be symbolic of the fire and destruction of the physical world as we knew it, but this is one of those things that too many people have gotten wrong in the past.  Everything gets judged at once.  There's no evacuation before the end.The second reason I have for not liking this book as much is that the Last Battle isn't won.  I know, you're going to say ""Isn't won?  How much more could they possibly win?""  Yes, the good guys won and the bad guys lost.  That's true, but not during the final battle.  All of that happened later.This second complaint is more of a storytelling one than a theological one.  We know, after all, that mortal man can't win the fight against evil on his own terms, no matter how hard he tries.  Still, half of the point of pursuing Heaven is so that we can be purified, and be useful in some manner, when we're needed the most.  God doesn't crush evil by himself.  He gives that honor to two very special creatures, one of whom crushes the serpent's head, and the other casts him into perdition for eternity.Creatures are involved in the final defeat of Satan, intimately involved.  It's not our job to just get out of the way, nor to be content with the battles that we lose.  The Last Battle isn't the one we fight while we're alive.  It's the overwhelming thrashing that the saints give him from Heaven.  I only wish that stage of the battle had been depicted, the humans, recently-defeated, joining the fallen armies of their comrades from all the ages for one last fight, a fight they can't possibly lose.  From a storytelling perspective, it would have been pure gold to depict such a thing.  The fact that the book could theologically support such a thing in its allegories, yet deliberately chooses not to is, in my mind, a major point against it.However, once again, I'm afraid that we must get back to the villains for the third point against the book.  Most of the villains in the Narnia series just weren't all that threatening, and in my opinion, the only one who seemed threatening at any point in this book was Rishda Tarkaan.  There were four major villains in this book, Shift, Ginger, Rishda and Tash, and only Rishda really struck me as a sufficient bad guy.Shift was a petty, uncreative dictator with transparent motives and a somewhat empty head.  Ginger was cunning, but not intimidating, because she never really established herself as anything more than a trickster working behind the scenes, and Tash only really appeared twice.  Neither time was he around for very long, and the second time, he gets shooed off before he could do anything really terrible.  Honestly, I thought the shed that Shift had kept the fake lion in was more threatening than Tash was.Still, these shortcomings don't make this a bad book.  Its end-of-the-world theology might be a little spotty, but its understanding of human nature, and of the final judgment are spot-on, and as petty and unthreatening as he is, Shift is a fine allegory for all those who try to squash different religions together in the name of their own greatness.  All such people, anyone who claims that all religions are the same, except with different words and names, are simply wrong, and are following false faiths, or even trying to create them, because they want people to follow them as the messiah, the way that Shift does.  Ultimately, they don't want to save or help anybody but themselves.  They just want to distract people from the teachings that matter, so they don't realize that their ""messiahs"" are just two-bit peddlers of their own, self-ruled, Earthly kingdoms, none of which will last beyond the current age.  It's a sobering lesson for the rest of us.Ginger is the type who thinks she can craftily manipulate people with her brilliant, secret knowledge about God and the supernatural not really existing, so she helps the false religions get their start, and doesn't fully realize how much evil she's done until she does the stupidest thing of all, walking right through the doors of Hell.Rishda is the trusted military, or town government, or public service authority, who deploys his men against the faithful because he personally agrees with the regime that the other two have set up.  He may even have closer ties to the higher-ups than they do, being only the ones who thought of it, after all.  Shift (Lenin) may do the commanding, and Ginger (Marx) may do the thinking, but without men like Rishda, willing to carry a sword in their name, no one ever really gets hurt.  The commander is ignored as the mindless psychopath he is, and the thinker is dismissed as just another nut with a goofy philosophy.  What really gives these people in authority the power to kill is us.  We do.  We fight in their militaries.  We enforce their phony, anti-religious ""laws,"" and we acknowledge their decisions as acceptable, or at least tolerable in polite company.  Rishda is the point where people fight for those who don't deserve it, where the worst harm is done.As you can see, I appreciate the allegories found in the villains in this book, and there's a very good reason why Rishda was so much more threatening than the others.  I just wish he'd gotten a bit more time in center stage during the story itself.I was also very impressed by the types of people who wound up in Aslan's Kingdom at the end.  Some follow Aslan, not even realizing it (Emeth,) while others turn away from him, despite the crowns that they once wore (Susan.)  The reason for this is quite clear.  Even a person who doesn't know God can still do their best to do the right thing, and even a person who knows him very well can still turn away from the faith.  Just ask the Galatians.In retrospect, the theological confusion I experienced near the beginning of this review probably wasn't that big a deal, but I still feel it's worth mentioning.  I suppose the real reason why I still feel this book was my second least favorite in the series is that I found it so unsatisfying emotionally, particularly the ending.  Then again, feelings don't really matter when you get right down to it, and mine certainly don't.All in all, though, I really liked this book, and if you don't identify happiness with excitement as much as I do, you'll probably like it even more.";1
313514;"All of a sudden, everything that 18-year-old Lainey Pike's ever known has changed. Her mother has committed suicide -- just months after her stepfather's death in a motorcycle accident -- and it's up to Lainey and the older half sister she barely knows to take care of their young adopted brother.To make matters worse, five-year-old Collin is hardly an easy child. As he's had a rocky start in life, he's got all sorts of behavioral problems. And the only person who seems to be able to handle him -- Lainey's longtime boyfriend Riley -- is the main person she's currently having issues getting along with. Nobody believes that Lainey could possibly want to ditch the seemingly perfect guy she's been with since she was 14 years old. But after a chance encounter with a stranger at the local 7-11 one night, Lainey becomes fixated on ""Slurpee Guy,"" dreaming about starting anew with him as her boyfriend.As time passes and Lainey, Vallery and Collin struggle to become a family in this new version of their lives, Lainey also grapples with what she wants from herself and her life. Unlike most girls coming of age, nothing in Lainey's world is certain -- she doesn't know if her sister will stick around or even where next week's grocery money is coming from, let alone if she might be able to go to college in the fall. It's during this bleak time that Lainey finally begins to ask herself questions, and take charge of her own life.Hoxter's debut novel portrays regular people living regular lives, who are suddenly called upon to make difficult choices. Readers of all ages will be able to identify and sympathize with Lainey, Vallery, and all their friends as they attempt to make sense of the chaos in their lives.";1
415460;If you're looking for an action-packed military book filled with fascinating anecdotes and gritty insights, keep looking. This book is positive proof that being a good sniper does not make a person a decent writer. The book is mostly about how macho the author is, how he'd gladly die for his country, but he enjoys killing for his country a whole lot more. Maybe the lack of interesting description about his various missions is related to a need to be unemotional if you're going to be a sniper, I don't know. This is just a boring book, very poorly written. Reading it is a total waste of time.;1

254177;I've been fascinated with Carlos Ruiz Zafon ever since I read The Shadow of the Wind two years ago. I would have gone into a shameless author binge sooner, but his previous novels have either not been translated to English or I have had not luck finding them in English. After enduring the sight of this book and three others by him, targeted at the young adult market, I finally broke down and decided to put my skills in Spanish to the ultimate test of reading an entire book. (I'm a native Portuguese speaker who's never learned Spanish properly, but reading comes with little effort.)It was well worth the minor struggle of reading this wonderful story in its original language. Zafon's writing is, of course, much less mature and polished than in TSOTW, but it still shines bright. The story isn't complex, but the main character is vivid. I imagine that this book would find a lot of interest among 12 year olds with a taste for suspense and bewilderment.;1
354856;The story is quite annoying in the beginning as it centres around Evie at High School doing high school things and everything that we read about in most other YA american based books. So, tedious, yes. We don't want to read about Evie at school, we want to hear about her high adventures!Thankfully, we're saved early on as Evie finds her Normal life incredible dull and boring. So, yes, she joins IPCA again on a part time basis and this is where the fun starts.Lend is back, albeit in small doses and he really grows as a character in this book. Gone are the early nerves of teen dating. Now Evie and Lend are in lurve! Big time.When Jack enters the scene I shrank at the love triangle occuring. It's an overused tome and really uncreative in a story such as this. But Jack does make for an interesting character who fools around and laughs his way through the story. He reminded me of Puck from the Iron Fey series, so in the end I liked him, though I didn't love him as much as Lend.Evie is still brilliant in her wit, and determination. Although this time she does crank up a little on the annoyance scale when she starts doing dumb things like lie to her boyfriend (and everyone else who have supported her since leaving IPCA), and randomly going off with Jack when she knows full well that he can't be trusted.On the whole I enjoyed the story, I'm still rating it as a 4 for pure genius on White's part for creating such a readable, unique storyline. But I did feel that the story punch line was more of a 'tell' thanks to Jack in his final moments, and then a quick 'rectify-the-situation-quickly' on Evie's part. So, to summarize, lots of story and filler to get the end which wasn't as terrifying and world-ending as the first book.Still a great read though!;1

626674;Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant, 1781, 1787, translated by Max Muller, revised by Marcus Weigelt, Penguin, 2007, 784 ff.To try to encapsulate even the essence of this great work in a review of a few hundred words is an almost impossible task (the book is over 700 pages long). For a man who rarely if ever journeyed beyond the confines of his city of birth, Konigsberg, this is a remarkable work and the first of three Critiques that he wrote (the others on Practical Reason and on Judgement).Kant presents us at the outset with the human dilemma: that we are burdened with questions we cannot ignore but which, even transcending all our powers, we are also not able to answer. He points out that, in an earlier age, metaphysics was regarded as the `queen of the sciences' amongst philosophers but that now, with the advance of scientific rationalism, discussion of metaphysics encourages only scorn.It was Kant's purpose in this treatise to explore the limits of metaphysics. It is in this work that Kant fused the ideas of the British empiricists (all knowledge is derived from the senses) and the Continental rationalists (mind is the only safe source of knowledge). Kant argued that we need both empiricism and rationalism to make sense of the world. The 'transcendental deduction' that philosophers agonize about (I am not a 'professional' philosopher), as I understand it, is that we also cannot do without a third source of knowledge that we might call intuition (or faith?). Kant argues that there are certain principles allowing us access to knowledge that we must accept 'a priori' - without experience of the world. The principle of causality (or, in philosophical terms, The Principle of Sufficient Reason)is one such example.Although this is an excellent translation (I have never read the original works), because of the size of the work and the complexity of the subject matter, this is really a book for undergraduate philosophy students or, at least, readers familiar with philosophical argument and the necessary staying power to get through the material. I agree with the reviewer who criticized the use of two different Kant originals (1st edn 1781, 2nd edn 1787) in the translations presented here, even though they are distinguished by being in Roman and italic type, respectively.

144098;"Follow Betty Bacal, the shy daughter of a Rumaniam immigrant, as she becomes stage struck, trains as a actress, has an overnight success modeling for Vogue, and is transformed by director Howard Hawkes into Lauren Bacall, the newcomer who sweeps Humphrey Bogart off his feet.Bacall's tale is irresistible, and she tells it well.  The story of her transformation at Howard Hawks's hands into the Slim of ""To Have and Have Not"" is all the more delicious because Bacall remains, while the cameras are not running, an inexperienced teen who misses her mother and her family in New York. Bacall's off-screen innocence contrasts strikingly and delightfully with her knowing on-screen persona.Bacall's account of her romance and marriage to Humphrey Bogart is graceful and moving.  Bacall quotes Bogart's letters to her during their courtship: these reveal his stunned incredulity at finally finding love after a lifetime of romantic failures.  Their marriage is a sweet reward to Bogart after years of domestic strife, and his gratitude at finding happiness and fatherhood in midlife is tremendously affecting.  Bogart's gallantry and courage in his final illness reduced me to tears, as did Bacall's despair at losing the love of her life.By her own account, Bacall's second marriage to Jason Robards was not a success.  She cares for her children (two by Bogart and one by Robards), but they do not appear central to her life.  The great loves dominating Bacall's post-Bogart years remain her mother and the acting profession.  Bacall's dedication to her craft is evident, both on stage and on screen, and she remains ever grateful for a good role-- a gratitude that grows more poignent as she ages.Any weaknesses?  A few.  Then Some, penned 27 years after By Myself, doesn't live up to the magic of the first installment, although one must admire Bacall's spirit in producing it.  And Bacall's rather cursory depiction of her children leaves the reader wondering about the status of her relationships with them.  But these criticisms are minor ones when measured against the charm and drama of Bacall's story.Lauren Bacall is now in her 80s.  Her memoirs span over 60 years of cinema and stage history.  Her story is well worth reading for those who appreciate American theater and film.  Highly recommended, especially for those interested in the private side of the Bacall-Bogart saga.";1

62050;Marian Keyes is a very funny writer, and like so many of her books, this one manages to deal with a serious subject and still be tremendously entertaining. The serious subject here is drug and alcohol addiction. In New York Irish ex-pat Rachel Walsh's life devolves as she develops cocaine and alcohol addictions. After losing her job, her boyfriend, and her best friend, Rachel finds herself back in Ireland in treatment. Refusing to believe that she is an addict, Rachel agrees to treatment only because she thinks she might see celebrities. What follows are Rachel's comic misadventures as an addict in denial while in treatment, interspersed with the story of how she became an addict.Keyes has an amazing ability to bring humor to horrible situations, and this is a book to read when you need a pick-me-up. The ending is a bit unbelievable, but the book is by and large light and fun reading.;1

619454;"Isabel Archer --the unforgettable protagonist of Henry James' ""The Portrait of a Lady"" -- says at some point that she doesn't want to begin life by marrying, and she attests there other things a woman can do. This declaration is the heart of the matter of this amazingly well executed and brilliant book.  Nave as she is, Isabel believes that in the 19th Century she would be able to enjoy her life and meet the world before getting married -- and not marrying is still a possibility.With Isabel's dilemma American writer Henry James deals with the conflict between society and individual longings. Many writers have dealt this issue -- but only a few succeeded with such grace and competence as this author.  The point is that Isabel is not the only one dealing with this problem. As a matter of fact, all characters of this novel, at some point in their life have to face the society against their personal wishes.James was a master of psychological development. Not a single character in this novel is unrealistic. The cast of supporting characters is as deep as Isabel. With his talent, the writer explores the psychological conflict is a result of the society pressures against the characters beliefs -- and not a gratuitous philosophy like many writers usually do. The depth brings another pleasure in the reading of the novel.Language is usually the main barrier for contemporary readers, when it comes to classic novels. With James it is a problem that can be easily overcome. His use of language however sophisticated is not difficult. His choice of words and structures are conscious and beautiful. The first chapters tend to be read slowly, but once the readers get the hang of James' prose, reading becomes an undeniable pleasure.At the same time the writer explore the psychological side of his characters, he never neglects their social conflict. In the last part of the novel, for instance, James explores the results of Isabel choices relating them to her identity -- and how one affected another. At the same time, James makes a curious choice: we never see the main events in Isabel's life, they are told to the reader after they happen. This use of ellipses happen usually when the heroine chooses to value social costume over her independence.As in most Henry James novels, he doesn't neglect the major conflict of this period of his work: Americans and Europeans. This time round the novel explore many American people living in Europe -- most characters are US born. If on the one hand, they represent the innocence, individualism and capability, the Europeans, on the other, are the sophistication, social convention and the decadence. But with so many Americans living in Europe how can one set the limits?Isabel moves from America to England and, then, to continental Europe. At each stage she loses her independency, and she realizes she cannot control her life the way she thought she could. And she realizes that there aren't many things a woman of her time could do before marrying.";1
354464;JUNE 4 You Look Different in Real Life by Jennifer CastleI liked Justine and connected with her right away, I felt confused for the first part of the book. I knew the premise but it just felt like everyone was going around knowing something that I didn't. Why Justine had changed, why she felt like such a disappointment, and what had changed at school.But I think that was the whole point. Because as you get into the story, Justine remembers the moments as the film crew is there again, and things all begin to fit together.One of the themes is that Justine is disappointed, and it comes out as anger. She is disappointed that she didn't live up to what her eleven year old self thought she would be. But then she begins to see what is special about her, what makes everyone special. That we all have a story to tell. It may not be one that makes millions, and then again, maybe we aren't looking at it the right way. But I loved each moment where something clicked for her. Where she realizes that it is okay to change, that she needs to love who she has become, and that she can always start working for another goal again.Another theme is friendship. How it can change or how some relationships just reach an end, whether natural or by a fight or other circumstances. I liked watching her with Felix, seeing how they encourage one another, how a true friendship should be and what we should strive for. Then there are the others that ended, and how Justine deals with the parts that were her fault.There was one part near the end where they were all together and had went through a lot, and she said that they helped make each other whole. They realized more about themselves and life by being together.The characters are all fleshed out well, and the pacing was good. The ending wrapped things up really well and I enjoyed the story overall.Bottom Line: A refreshing premise that delivers emotion, and shows the lives of characters that were changed both positively and negatively by being on screen.;1
337579;"Teaser: Discover how Fox News is part of the Liberal conspiracy to destroy America, as are the Weather Channel, ESPN, ...This is a review of how well/poorly the book delivers on what it advertises itself to be. It is _not_ about politics, except as necessary for examples.I picked up the book because I dislike much of what I see from Hollywood, both in terms of themes and portrayal of characters. I knew from the summaries that I would disagree with much of the author's politics -- I am 60 and grew up in a conservative rural village whose values differed from those of modern (post-Reaganite) conservatives -- but I didn't see that difference as a problem because I was interested in the observations, analysis and perspective of a critic from within Hollywood. My training in advocacy -- political and commercial marketing -- was to seek out and pay close attention to those with different perspectives, especially your critics, competitors, and opposition, because that was one of the best ways to find weaknesses in your ideas and in the presentation of those ideas and thereby improve your case (ideas and presentation).The overriding problem with this book is that it has all the hallmarks of the author never having heard even the slightest challenges to what he is saying, and thus it is littered with silly, stupid and disingenuous statements, obvious contradictions and gross hypocrisies. For example, the book would have you believe the teaser above (and explained below). If I hadn't felt so ill-served by the various reviews and recommendations, I would have simply stopped reading, but I felt I owed this review to other potential readers.  Plus, the book quickly became a train wreck that was too hard to look away from.What follows are examples of the failings of the various aspects of this book. However, if what you are looking for is a rant against liberals (rants of various flavors are a legit category of books), or you otherwise want to believe the book's thesis, I suggest that you skip to other reviews.One of the primary _advertised_ features of this book are the interviews with major Hollywood insiders. It would have been fascinating to read what those people said, and avoided saying, in response to probing questions from a conservative (or other person from an dissimilar viewpoint). Unfortunately, those _interviews_ are nowhere to be found in this book. What you do encounter are scattered short quotes that are indistinguishable from those he excerpted from what he had read.  I quickly came to discount the quotes: Many didn't support the claims he made of them and there was a rhetorical pattern of small, often fragmentary, quoting that is a strong indicator that the quotes were carefully selected and massaged to fit the preconceived thesis rather than having had any role in the development of that thesis. Since the author went to Harvard Law School, I am presuming that he is well-aware of basic rhetorical tactics and tricks (both detecting and using) and that their occurrences in this book are largely intentional. Additionally, when the background and perspective of the author and interviewees are as different as here, my experience is that I should expect to ""hear"" decidedly different ""voices"" in their quotes, as well as differences between the various interviewees. And that difference should be still be present even when the author paraphrases their comments. There was so little of this in this book that it raised humongous red flags about the representations of what was said.The author doesn't let facts, or ignorance of facts, get in the way of his thesis. Crucial to his explanation of how the Left controls Hollywood is that the advertisers have been duped by the networks about what shows to sponsor, sometimes with complicity of those in the ad agencies doing media buys (ad placement). He claims that the corporations (retailers and manufacturers) don't know who is buying their products or how customers make buying decisions.  He claims that there has been scant research in this area, and dismisses that research as tainted by methodological problems and the Leftist connections of the researchers. In the book's presentation of this topic, you won't find a mention of the corporations' marketing departments or of the portions of advertising agencies that develop campaigns, or ... (pp 10,...)The author totally discredits himself on his secondary thesis: That there is pervasive discrimination against conservatives in Hollywood. Note: I have no basis to judge whether or not this is true, I am simply saying that the book fails miserably in making this case.- The book's primary example of this discrimination is Michael Moriarty for being fired from ""Law & Order"". The book presents only his self-serving explanation -- one that doesn't pass a basic ""smell test"". A quick check on the web finds both an alternate explanation (""erratic behavior"") plus various pieces of evidence providing credence to that explanation (example: his overblown ego seems competitive with that of Charlie Sheen and Donald Trump). If political beliefs was the reason, why did L&O, later hire Angie Harmon, someone who routinely appears on lists of prominent Hollywood conservatives?- The author's secondary example is himself (pp xvi-xvii). He recounts how he was supported by a top Hollywood producer (Goldberg), had his work actively shopped around by three agents, had support from an entertainment attorney whom he identified as a liberal, but that ""a producer on one of the shows"" said that he wouldn't work with the author (After reading this book, I too would refuse to work with the author, and it has nothing to do with politics). From this one person among many, in an extreme example of confirmation bias, the author decides that ""liberals employ a mirror form of McCarthyism on a large scale."" (pg xvi)- His third example is Patricia Heaton who says she is having difficulty with work because she is a conservative. Since she is currently starring in ""The Middle"" and formerly starred in ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", a detailed explanation is called for, but not even a hint is given. Neither is her situation compared and contrasted to prominent conservatives who seem not to have problems. While Heaton isn't in the top tier (eg Tom Selleck, Kelsey Grammer), she seems comparable to Angie Harmon who seems to have had consistent work (see her IMDB profile) and to have had no problem being hired by liberals since most of that work has been in what the author categorizes as part of the liberal agenda, for example ""feminist legitimization"".- The author also cites similar claims from unnamed conservatives, but he states he is unsure of the validity because ""many of those that complain that they can't get work _can't_ make the grade."" (pg xvi, emphasis in book)- Although the book mentions writer-producer Donald Bellisario (NCIS, JAG, Quantum Leap, Magnum PI, Airwolf,...) who is a highly visible conservative, there is no discussion of the success of people like him.And in all his interviews, the author apparently never thought to ask how liberals rationalized the claimed freezing out of conservatives.The primary thesis of liberal propaganda is pure conspiracy logic: If the author judges person A to be part of the conspiracy, then everyone who simply worked with A is probably part of the conspiracy, as is everyone who worked with them, ad infinitum.  Am I overreacting to mere hyperbole? In the Prologue (pg xii), he states that Hollywood is ""a carefully constructed mechanism designed by television's honchos to blow a hole in the dike of American culture. Television's best and brightest wanted to set American sliding down the slippery slope away from its Judeo-Christian heritage...And they succeeded. ... planned ... coordinated ... implemented by a vast group of like-minded politically motivated people..."" And when TV executives are quoted as wanting TV to be about ""more than just ratings"", the author interprets this as a desire to destroy American culture (What else could that phrase possibly mean?).The author seems to treat his proffered quotes with absolute credulity, not considering possibilities such as self-aggrandizement. Nor does he consider whether what the person reports happening did actually happen. And most importantly, he doesn't even think to ask whether the message that these people thought they were sending was the message being received.  The book's description of various shows, most significantly ""All in the Family"" and ""Family Ties"", have only a passing resemblance to what I saw in first run and how people around me reacted to them.The ""begats"" occupy a large portion of the book, but you might not want to skip them because intermixed in are analyses of TV shows that are hilarious for anyone not drinking the book's Cool-aid. For example, ""Charlie's Angels"" was part of the Leftist conspiracy to destroy America's values because ""Women were doing what men traditionally did and doing it well."" (producer Goldberg, pg 179). If you take this quote seriously -- although you shouldn't because the show was universally described at the time as ""T&A,"" -- ask ""Why this show rather than the earlier 'Police Woman' (Angie Dickinson, 1974-78)? Or 'Honey West' (1965-66)? ""Basic human psychology is to try to impose an order on events even where there is none. Conservatives, with their belief in a simple, authoritative, powerful hierarchy, exacerbate this trait. Consequently, ""disorderly"" explanations -- involving statistics, game theory... -- tend to be rejected in favor of determinism via a hidden hand or conspiracy.  This book treats what seem to be normal business decisions, both good and bad, as a result of the liberal conspiracy.  Most notably he has a section ""Liberalism for Sweeps Week"" (pg 198) where his argument seems to rest on having causality reversed: He seems to assume that Sweeps Weeks _inherently_ have large audiences, thus the appearance of salacious and controversial material during those periods must be part of the liberal agenda to push that material at those large audiences, whereas the conventional explanation is that such material is emphasized during those periods to _draw_ large audiences because those ratings set advertising rates. His discussion of business and economics is a painful example of how badly our elite schools are failing to educate students.The overall writing style is vague and non-specific, making it virtually impossible to refute individual sections with facts or logic (because his defenders can easily claim that that is not what he meant). Instead there is a stream of assertions that will convince those already predisposed to believe, and probably no one else. Fortunately, it is not laden with the impenetrable terminology that emanates from Leftist echo chambers.  Some of the contradictions appear to be strategic, for example, despite the book claiming a vast monolithic Left-wing conspiracy, he has a brief passage on pg 13 saying that ""most"" and ""many"" Hollywood liberals do not engage in this conduct.  And in his final chapter, he presents himself as a reasonable constructive commentator, in stark contrast to what has come before.Over the years, there has been extensive discussion of how the aptitudes needed for various segments of the entertainment industry skew toward those that tend to be found in liberals/not found in conservatives.  For example, most successful comics are disrespectful of authority and the status quo. Although the book makes a few brief mentions of fragments of these ideas, it isn't enough to help the reader think about how much of the liberal-conservative imbalance is due to natural selection vs discrimination and conspiracy.  And much of the entertainment _industry_ is based on satisfying the human appetite to be stimulated by the new and different, yet the author seems to label any of this of which he disapproves as part of the conspiracy.Many of the contradictions appear to arise simply from him wanting to blame everything on the liberal conspiracy.  For example, narrow-casting ""inherently leads to liberalism"" by dividing us and hence liberals are behind destroying the broad-casting model (pg 10) but subsequently claims are that liberals are pushing broad-casting to reach large audiences.The author cites the comedic meme of mocking fathers as dating back to the ancient Greeks and Romans (Aristophanes and Plautus, pg 88) and yet he subsequently attacks writers working in this tradition for trying to destroy traditional values. While I would agree that this meme is badly overused, laziness and incompetence seem to be a better explanation than conspiracy (to paraphrase a traditional admonition).The book is advertised as providing an interesting conservative perspective on various classic TV series, but it is slight and shallow and often focuses on one or two specific offenses to conservatism. For example, in several places the book classifies ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" as a very conservative show but also places it in the liberal ""vanguard"" (pg 94) because an episode that involved a mistaken case of mistaken identity that was resolved when the other couple was discovered to be Black.  Since this was part of the book's criticism of ""realism"", was the unforgivable offense simply the very brief appearance of a Black couple onscreen?  The author denounces a variety of shows for the ""realism"" of including members of minorities and other groups, and then turns around and criticizes ""Law & Order"" for including too few minorities for ""realism"" (pg 202).This attack on L&O, has long been shown to be disingenuous: L&O, focuses on complex cases, often involving power, wealth and unusual intersections of law and morality. These cases don't have the same ethnic patterns as the vast majority of crimes (burglary, robbery, low-level drug dealing,...), contrary to the standard conservative attack on L&O., I am not arguing that L&O, doesn't have a decided liberal viewpoint, but rather pointing out that the _book's_ portrayal and argument are dishonest.The author well knows that scripts for episodes may come from a writer with no previous or future association with the series (he describes shopping such a script in the Prologue).  Yet his analyses of series repeatedly use isolated episodes that are not representative of how I remember those series.  This is confirmation bias/cherry-picking to the extreme.The author's criteria for a show being part of the liberal conspiracy often seems to be that it isn't 100% what he regards as ""conservative"". For example, while acknowledging that ""The Simpsons"" targets everyone, the book classifies it as ""liberal nihilism"" because _some_ of those targets are conservatives. And in the Prologue (pg xi), he misrepresents the episode ""Something About Marrying"" (Season 16, Episode 345, 20 February 2005) as ""propaganda for liberal values"" because ""the City of Springfield was legalizing gay marriage"". However, if one were to actually watch the episode, or read a summary from the Web, you would find that legalization was a cynical mercenary ploy to bring in tourist dollars, that is, it was not support of gay marriage but exploitation of an underserved market. For show after show, the author equates a show's _mentioning_ a topic with promoting and propagandizing for the Leftist position on it.Similarly for people: Ted Turner is classified as part of the liberal campaign (pg 61) primarily for being a pioneer of cable channels (narrow-casting), but also mentioned are instances where he deviates slightly from modern conservatism, for example protecting habitat even though it is through a buffalo ranching business. However, not Rupert Murdoch, whose Fox News is based on narrow-casting and whose Fox Network is denounced in this book as having a much larger role in the liberal conspiracy (by coarsening the culture). Go figure.""Happy Days"" earns its spot in the liberal takeover of Hollywood on the basis of a couple lines of peripheral, seemingly innocuous dialogue in a single (unspecified) episode (out of 255). This is attributed to one of the writers unsuccessfully attempting to introduce the subtext of a foreshadowing of Vietnam into the series (pg 116). So  on one hand we are told of a lone writer unsuccessfully attempting to sneak liberal propaganda onto TV against the vision of the producer and the network executives (that the show be ""innocent"") and on the other hand we are told that all those people were part of a pervasive conspiracy. And since when is foreshadowing regarded as liberal propaganda? It is a basic story-telling technique, for example, it appeared in Homer's ""Iliad"". Author Shapiro points out that this attempt went undetected by everyone and thus is proof of how effective liberal propaganda is. Hold it: Its total ineffectiveness proves it was effective? By this point in the book you shouldn't be surprised that failure ""proves"" success, that an individual's isolated action ""proves"" conspiracy and that apolitical is political.So why are ""The Weather Channel"", ESPN, Fox News... subversive? In flailing about to create a vast Leftist conspiracy, the author includes cable channels / narrow-casting (above), not thinking through the implications.  This is a mistake he would not have made if he had made even the slightest attempt to be honest about this development. The conventional history is that cable TV systems arose to simply distribute broadcast TV in areas where reception was poor. In the mid-1970s, the technology and economics made possible  distribution of additional content to fill the vast amount of unused bandwidth on the cable systems. The cable company owners found it highly profitable to include these additional channels, and corporations and entrepreneurs found it highly profitable to create channels for underserved markets. While the author cites valid observations about _some_ negative social and political effects of this change, attributing it to a liberal conspiracy is indicative of the author's mindset.The book lists the top 15 current shows for Republicans (pg 255), but makes no attempt to reconcile these entries with previous criticism, for example ""Desperate Housewives"" (#10) which he had classified as having ""deep political content"" (pg 53). Similarly for ""Two and a Half Men"" (#15).Similarly for the author's own ""The Best Conservative Shows in Television History"":#6: ""Gunsmoke"":  Miss Kitty, one of the four main characters, is a career woman and business owner: a prostitute who became a madam (acknowledged within the show). And the show clearly implies a long-term sexual relationship (more than 20 years) with Marshall Dillon without the benefit of marriage. Yet the author condemns ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" for ""feminist legitimization"" (pg 36) because Mary has a career in traditional ""women's work"" (subordinate, supportive of male characters) while (unsuccessfully) seeking a husband.#3: ""Magnum PI"": Magnum lives like an indulged ""trust-fund baby"" -- lots of luxuries, negligible responsibilities -- in adolescent revolt against the authority/surrogate-father figure (Higgins).  The author likes the show because Magnum is presented as former military. But Magnum has neither military bearing nor attitudes: He is immature, undisciplined, dishonest, sloppy, imprecise, avoiding accountability. Boyish charm may cover a multitude of sins in Hollywood, but not in the military. Of the series' four main characters, the two representing Conservative values are a foreigner (Higgins) and a minority (T.C.). Not criticizing the show (it was very good), just the author's reasoning.#1: ""24"": Jack rejects the Rule of Law and traditional ethics for ""The ends justify the means"" (which may not qualify as even situational ethics). He has contempt for authority and the hierarchy. The show trashes the notion of ""Character counts"" by having anyone be trivially corrupted by the bad guys. The ""plots"" reject the belief in an orderly world, instead depending on a constant stream of deus ex machina.  There are career women in the workplace doing traditional men's work, and not only is Chloe far superior to the men in tech, women are among the front-line warriors, shooting and killing terrorists! The horror, the horror! And while the author has the violence here as cathartic, very similar violence in ""The Untouchables"" had previously been denounced as part of the liberal conspiracy.If you are seeking the unchallenging comfort of being deep inside an echo chamber, this book may fill that need.  However, if you are a critical reader or intellectually curious, this book will be an offense (whatever your politics).-- Douglas B. Moran";1

129653;I wish I knew more about this curious manuscript.  I'm still not sure I understand the 'discovery story'. As best I can tell, the text was found in an ancient urn with 50+ other manuscripts.  The contents of the urn are now called a library, based on the assumption someone hid their library in the urn and buried it.The actual 'gospel' is easier to read than I expected.  It reminded me of Zen koans and I enjoy a good riddle.But, puzzled I remain.  The various interpretations offered by the book leave me wondering and feeling a need to read more.  In particular, I'd like to know how to place these documents in the context of other 2nd century manuscripts.;1

404760;Ah, I just can't seem to get enough of these young adult dystopian novels. In Ms. Rossi's world there are really two worlds comprised of the Dwellers and the Savages. The Dwellers live in Pods, sealed in from the Aether storms that ravage the world outside. The Savages live in tribes, surviving as best they can in the harsh environment.Aria is meant to die and she would have without the help of an Outsider. She knows her best chance of getting to her mother is teaming up with the quiet Savage named Perry. But she doesn't have to like it. Right off, there's a feeling that Aria is different from the typical Dweller even if we see very little of the Dwellers after Aria is exiled. She has preconceived ideas about the Outsiders and their world which she allows to color her judgement of Perry.Perry is desperate to get into Reverie and he's willing to do whatever it takes even if that means traveling with the Dweller Aria. At first she is a burden to him but he needs her help. He agrees to help her if she will help him once they get inside Reverie. It's an uneasy alliance they form for Perry thinks little of the girl who has had what he perceives as an easy life inside the Pods.As Aria and Perry make their way across the bleak and dangerous landscape, they begin to learn more about each other and how their suspicions were not all based on fact. I liked seeing each character evolve into more than what they were. Aria learns of strengths she never dreamed she had and Perry learns to value himself.It's easy to become absorbed in the world with it's menacing overtones, never knowing where the next threat will come from. While I found the journey Aria and Perry take compelling, I didn't get a feeling of completeness to the world itself. It needed more details on how the two separate worlds came to be.Aria and Perry do have a romance but it stays secondary to their ultimate goals. They do become friends/allies before they take that final step to become romantically involved but I couldn't help but feel the romance was heavily influenced by their constant proximity and life and death situations. Along with them are secondary character who offer support and guidance but the focus stays on Aria and Perry and their relationship.The story is told in alternating chapter POV between Aria and Perry. This seems to be the most common for young adult fiction. I enjoyed Ms. Rossi writing style - it follows well with a descriptiveness that can at times captivate. The ending is left with some questions answered but the future still remains open in this first book of the trilogy. I know I'll want to read about Aria and Perry and their continuing story.;1

His daydreams are interesting and the time we witness his life with his wife, you feel a little sad for him as she seems to think he is so incompetent. Despite being short I liked this story and I think it will make a powerful story, when it's released on film.Ben Stiller is a good narrator and I'm interested to see how good he will perform this story on the big screen.;1

The Logan family is an honest, hard working family living in Mississippi during the Depression era. The parents work hard to make a living and to teach their children right from wrong, even when ""wrong"" happens to and around them very day.

208868;I couldn't help but wonder, while I was reading this dribble, who paid Crichton off?  To insist most emphatically that there is no such thing as global warming occurring during these times is just fooilsh.  He either has some peculiar motivation for writing this book, or he has had his head buried in the sand.  The tragedy is, thousands probably actually believe him. Try living through a few of the recent hurricanes if you don't believe me.  And then check the data for hurricane predictions for the next seven years. That global warming is a fact is no fallacy.;1
294737;"This is a mix of a biography of a bird, an autobiography of a woman scientist, a scientific exploration of bird intelligence, and some metaphysical lessons at the end.  The style is personal, sometimes emotional, and what counts as informal for academics, a quick read.  I found the parts about Alex, the parrot, the most interesting.  The autobiographical aspect was interesting too, but not quite as unusual or movingly told.The book starts with a highly emotional account of reactions to the death of Alex, twenty years premature at age 31, including numerous testimonials of the importance he had for people who knew of him through Pepperberg's work.  She had trained Alex as part of a research project in animal intelligence/communication, and they had received a good deal of coverage in the media over the years.  The outpouring she describes, and her own devastation, grabbed me right away.  Why would a bird have such a profound impact on not only Pepperberg but so many others, most of whom never met Alex?  How smart was this bird, really?  The answers are compelling, if incomplete.After the first chapter the book proceeds mainly chronologically, starting with Pepperberg's early years, her first bird at age four, how she developed the interests that led to her scientific career, how that career developed, how Alex came into her life, and how his career, as it were, developed along with hers.Major themes include the struggle of a woman in a male-dominated science, the struggles of researchers who take seriously the ability of animals to use language, and Pepperberg's particular struggles to get funding and respect for her work.But the main attraction remains Alex.  It's fascinating to see how smart and, in some ways, how human Alex seems to be.  He uses English words in appropriate ways, he shows he can associate colors, shapes, objects and numbers of things with words.  He also shows personality traits, such as what looks like bossiness and a proclivity for game-playing.  For instance, when Alex got bored (as we would most naturally interpret it) he would sometimes give every incorrect answer to a question like ""how many?"" or ""what color?"" skipping only the correct one.Pepperberg is careful to inject some caution about how to interpret these things.  She calls Alex's utterances ""labels"" instead of ""words,"" for example, to avoid implying that Alex is using language as we normally think of it.  At the same time, she is determined to show that Alex has done a series of things that the scientific community as a whole had thought impossible for a bird.  Sometimes, despite her general caution, she seems to suggest more than could really be, as when she favorably compares Alex's use of the label ""none"" to the great ancient mathematician Euclid's lack of a concept of zero.  Euclid did, of course, have a concept of ""none.""  (Maybe she was joking--I hope so.)  She also sometimes speaks of Alex's grasping other concepts in ways that suggest more understanding than is likely.Working out these issues might have been aided by a more developed discussion of the alternative interpretations of Alex's behavior held by critics of Pepperberg's work.  What we mainly get instead are anecdotes about how unfair or intimidating the opposition is.  (Boca, in a comment to this review, suggests readingThe Alex Studies: Cognitive and Communicative Abilities of Grey Parrots, which is Pepperberg's scientific account, for a more rigorous view.)The last chapter consists of the lessons we can learn from Alex.  By the end of the chapter Alex has become a virtual key to the meaning of life, showing the place of humanity in the universe, and where we went wrong about issues such as poverty and climate change.  Much of this, while not entirely without merit, and no doubt deeply felt, is superficially and loosely reasoned.  In reaching so far, this tribute is often remote from the particular facts of Alex's life as presented in the book.Recommended for those seeking an informal account of a remarkable case of animal intelligence, and for those who enjoy stories about animals and their humans.  You'll also get an interesting story of how a woman made a difficult way in science.";1

294623;Alex & Me: How a Scientist and a Parrot Discovered a Hidden World of Animal Intelligence--and Formed a Deep Bond in the Process by author Irene M. Pepperberg was a wonderful read!  I am an animal lover thru and thru and truly believe that humans and animals can communicate on many levels.  I've raised a kitten from birth, I've had to euthanize a beloved animal friend of many, many years, I've owned dogs, cats have owned me, I've seen and done it all!!  This was a truly amazing book to read!Alex is an African Gray Parrot who partnered with Pepperberg for 30 years to challenge people and scientists alike to look beyond just the bird they saw.  Alex was able to add, sound out words, and understand concepts such as bigger and smaller.  He was also able to bond with Irene Pepperberg in ways that most non-animal owners just cannot fathom.This book is about Alex, his remarkable life, his untimely death, and few other birds as well.  I cried, I laughed, I completely understood the bond between bird and owner.I highly, highly recommend this book to all animal lovers who know how to communicate with their beloved pets!-1smileycat :-);1
13232;When JRR Tolkien wrote this, he wrote it as all one book. The publisher then split up the six full sections into three books, with two sections in each book. This Kindle version is as he wrote it, it's all one volume. While I haven't gotten to the end yet, it has a clickable TOC and you can go to Appendixes if you want to,(My favorite character has always been Gandalf.)

You'll never find a finer book of fiction than this.;1
65115;I did not go to school in America, and read this book about a year ago, but for whatever reason, I ended up here, and have to write some kind of upbeat report on the Great Gatsby to try to balance the tide against all  the revisionist critics.The reason I mention school is that it would  appear a lot of people have had traumatising experiences with classics  being thrust down their throats. I do not know if it is a case of bad  teacher, bad student, or simple incompatibility, but I would say this - if  you really did not enjoy a book, DON'T TELL OTHER PEOPLE NOT TO READ IT!  One of the most disappointing experiences of my literary career (if you can  call it that) was when I recommended my girlfriend to read Catch-22, and  had it metaphorically hurled in my face after &quot,3 chapters&quot,.  That's her right, but the negative reaction will always hurt more people  than help them, whereas vice-versa for the positive one...especially since  I have noticed that works that someone has always been attached to can  still be reduced for them in the face of violent enough criticism. If you  had a bad experience at school, it's fair enough to be upset about it...but  this truly is a great book which should only have great things written  about it.Both of Catch-22 and the Great Gatsby have humour and grace,  and not a little hidden dignity. But Gatsby is clearly the superior work  for the symbolists and amateur students of literature. It is a period  novel, but like all the greatest of these kinds of works of fiction, it  reaches far beyond its time. The writing is timeless, and the mystery makes  for a latter day Much Ado About Nothing - perhaps it is boring on the  surface, but boring like tectonic plates: fundamental, dealing in huge  issues in subtle and slow movements. Yet it is not even a particularly long  novel - several hours of great entertainment and effort well expended.I  hate having to write prescriptively, but sometimes you can't help reacting,  you know?;1

541273;You've probably been recommended this book by at least two people and the good news is: they're right. They were completely wrong to recommend you `Vernon God Little', mind, but that's another story... When I was a teacher in an American high school we had a half-day training from the special needs department on Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism. Kids with Asperger's are often very high-functioning, smart kids, but are unable to relate to other people and have an extremely hard time understanding metaphors, sarcasm and facial expressions. We were taught how to adapt our classes if we had a kid with this condition in class. Had this book been written at the time it would have been a perfect introduction to understanding this fascinating mindset and learning about the daily struggles these kids, and their guardians, face.Christopher is the `gifted', teenaged narrator of this story which starts with the murder of their neighbour's dog. He sets out to investigate who killed it and along the way learns family secrets and travels far outside of his usual comfort zone. His strangely ordered thinking and lack of shades of grey in his emotions make his narration unique. His reasoning is impeccable but weird and even the most mundane goings-on are rendered bizarre through Christopher's eyes. The more red cars he sees in a row on the way to school, the better day he'll have and if he sees yellow cars, then he won't talk, eat or communicate with anyone for potentially days. He wont't eat any food if it touches a different food on his plate yet he can do all the Rain Man mathematical tricks.At one stage, he ends up going on a solo journey, recording people's bewildered reactions to him as he goes. As a reader, you're caught up in worrying about him and at the same time amused at the gentle fish-out-of-water comedy that will be familiar to you if you've read Iain Banks' `Whit' which has a nave but preternaturally smart member of a Scottish cult leaving home for the first time to complete a holy mission in the outside world.The lack of verbiage and insistence of the plot makes this highly readable. It's a great read for a plane or train journey, or maybe even a long tube ride if you skip the mathematical sidetracks. If you know someone with this condition or are likely to encounter someone in your profession, you'll gain a lot of insight through this well researched and gripping novel. Even if you don't, you'll enjoy your travels with Christopher and maybe pick up some 'A'-Level maths along the way.;1

I work in the energy industry and I was interested in understanding the theory behind some specific renewable energy processes from an engineering perspective and this book delivered that in great depth.  Each chapter focuses on a particular source of renewable energy and can be read independent of the previous chapters.  This is a very good reference book and a lot more than the typical books on renewable energy which are usually primers. But to be completely fair I must say, that I lack the engineering expertise to really comment on the quality and accuracy of the material.;1

A more satifying ending would have been to have her stay with her clueless but loving husband and commute to her new job and classes. Instead, she opts to pay rent on a new apartment and her 6-year-old son is supposed to just deal with it whether he likes it or not.Dellarobia berates her mother-in-law for being judgmental, but I think Dellarbobia is pretty judgmental herself, of the people around her, including her husband. Nobody said it was an ideal way to start a marriage, but worse things have happened! Cub isn't perfect, but he did take his wife's side on the logging. The scene where he's playing with the kids is touching.

That means that not only is it telling an entertaining tale, it is also calling to something deep in the readers' souls. Examination of available books shows that at least a dozen sequels to it have been written, I have reviewed one and will soon review another, but I am not going to buy and read all of them. Therefore I might be missing something I would enjoy.But what I am not missing is this: Jane Austen believed in sense and sobriety. She believed that the happiest marriage was one between a man and woman who were intellectually and spiritually in tune with one another.To the readers, I say: Go thou and do likewise. Read the book. Then do what Elizabeth and Jane wold approve, and you will find yourself happier in the long run than those who ignore the principles Pride and Prejudice is meant to exhibit.";1

22243;I really liked the first half of the book--it was classic Stuart MacBride, where nothing goes quite right, and what goes wrong goes spectacularly, muddily, soddenly wrong.  Then his hero, Logan MacRae, was sent off to Poland and the plot got very silly for a while.  Suddenly there were big explosions and there was lots of chaos and mayhem.  That didn't make it a bad read--just not as good as the first half of the book.  MacBride mostly reeled it back in by the end, and the final chapter is just lovely and gruesome.  Unlike some other readers, I like it when MacBride gets enthusiastic about the blood and gore.  This one wasn't as gruesome as his previous novel, but that's okay.;1

323079;"""Red to Black"" seems to be a spy-thriller romance that is loaded with apparently accurate deep real-world Russian and KGB/SVR history -- that is appropriate for this novel. Some folks may be a bit put-off by the regular doses of detailed history, names and data. As for me -- this novel has equally regular waves of spy-thriller romantic personal adventure -- spot-on to flesh-out the technical [historical] detail. When this kind of close-up adventure within the big-picture is well-done it can work-out just fine -- as with ""Red to Black"". Be warned, however, that there is only a moderate amount of grim violence and dark suspense -- as compared to many such spy-versus-spy sagas -- yet maybe even more realistic for that. Much espionage work seems to be just that -- tricky careful investigative work. With current political events unfolding between USA, Europe and Russia there may be added spice to such an interesting novel +++";1

501381;When I was in elementary school, in the years between 1993 and 1995, when I was in grades 3-5, you were a loser if you hadn't read these books. Every single person I knew loved them and they were among my favorites. They were, that is, until my best friend came over to spend the night one night at the end of the fifth grade. She took one look at one of Stephen Gammell's gloriously horrific illustrations and threw the book down in disgust. She was scared to death and after about 5 minutes, I was as well. We shoved them under the couch cushions and had to watch 'The Flintstones' to calm down. I never looked back at them after that and sold them at our garage sale the next year to the neighbor-boy across the street. I didn't think of them again until mid-September of this year. I saw one of them at a used bookstore but didn't buy it because it was in horrible condition. I regret getting rid of these wonderful books and will be spending some time buying them back.

85880;"""End Game,"" the perhaps final entry in the Jani Kilian saga, is the best yet. And it's been a long time coming--the first of the pentology, ""Code of Conduct,"" has a 1999 copyright date, and the previous volume in the series, ""Contact Imminent,"" appeared in 2004. (There's a list of all the books in the series in a full-page advert following the conclusion of the book. Naturally, they should be read in the correct order.)This time out, Jani--half human, half alien Idomeni--is confronted with the usual cast of characters that fans in the series know well (and maybe you'll wish a character list had been supplied), who attempt to manipulate her (usually without success). There has been an assassination on the hybrid enclave, Thalassa, which leaves her in charge. She tries to hunt down the assassin (whose point of view alternates throughout the book with Jani's), while the Earth government's various civil and military figures meddle, and the tale becomes one of chase, revenge, and politics.Jani, faced with the conflicting motivations of the others, tries to make things up as she goes along. Usually her plans succeed only partially, if at all. And that's one of the many things that make this novel so interesting--Jani makes mistakes. She's no superhero, and she can be very nasty and impulsive.As usual with Ms. Smith, there's great character development and flowing prose. The author's great with small details--when people stop for meals she tells you what they ate and drank without making her readers snarl ""get on with it!"" And she notices what people do with their hands when they talk.But (and this is where the author has shown the greatest improvement from book to book), over time she's cut down on the flashbacks and the plot intricacies. This book's clarity itself.A minor complaint: the novel for all intents and purposes concludes on page 369 when Col. Niall Pierce, the Shakespeare-quoting security chief, tips his hat to Jani. However, in a long, almost Victorian-style coda, the book continues on until page 404. A simple five- or maybe 10-page epilogue would have done the job. But on the whole, this is a fabulous book. It will be interesting to see if Ms. Smith will go on to something else, or start a new series involving Jani. Either way, I'll be waiting anxiously.";1

It's one of the very best (at least on par with ""Reaper Man,"" and maybe even a tad bit better).  Obviously, this book centers around Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg, and Magrat Garlick.  Pratchett uses the actual concept of fairy tales as his template.  His main fairy tale is Cinderella.  But, he brings many others in:  ""Snow White,"" ""The Three Little Pigs,"" ""Little Red Riding Hood.""  He's even got references to ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Wizard of Oz.""  As always, the interesting relationship between Granny and Nanny is hilarious.  As an added bonus, in this book, Pratchett's given quite a bit of emphasis to Grebo (Nanny's cat (who deserves a book all of his own)).  This is a must-read book, especially if you're a fan of Granny, Nanny, and Magrat:  5 stars out of 5.";1

It would have been a better fit for me if the book did not have language that I dislike. I even thought, from the title, that I would be able to share it with my teenage grandchildren who will soon be part of the corporate world. But, I can't.Perhaps I missed reading the part of the book where the author advised readers against using language that isn't suitable for all audiences. In my 39 year career (in Accounting and Human Resources, from clerical to management), I found that the best leaders either instinctively knew/learned how to present themselves and their ideas so that those around them felt respected and valued - and wanted to be part of the team.It is easy to tell that the author has a wealth of experience.

422089;"Sometimes you hold such high expectations for a book, only to be let down when you finally have it in your hands. Such is the case with THE WARD by Jordana Frankel. Look at the cover. Now read the book description. Don't both of these items combined give you hope that the contents will be equally as amazing? In this case, not so much. THE WARD is one instance when a story has potential, but the execution untimately drags it down.THE WARD started off on a good note alright, but once you get past the (oddly placed) epilogue, the interest level in both the MC and her world begins to fizzle. (Seriously, why couldn't the epilogue have just been ""chapter one""? Is it that the time jump would have been too jarring to the reader? Because it was still jarring, regardless.) Right off the bat I had this feeling that THE WARD was something like an apocalyptic Annie or Oliver Twist, thanks to the introduction of the two main characters, Ren and her ""sister"" Aven. Initially, I liked them both very much. But the only character to retain my interest was Aven. She was just so DARNED cute and quirky! Too bad she had to up and get ""sick"" all of a sudden... Then be relegated to that of a minor character. Can't really say the same about Ren, who lost her Annie/Oliver personality and became just plain confusing. (Was she a Southerner? A Yankee? From the early 20th century Britain? Her dialogue was literally all. Over. The. Place.)A whole onslaught of characters are introduced throughout the story and I felt a connection to not a single one of them. That goes for the world, too, which was just as confusing when it comes to its technology and it is with its overall descriptions. I can tell that it is a tyrannic society in which Ren lives - that much is true especially by the time you finally come to the end of the book. But just how much is restricted from the common man (or even lower than the common man, considering Ren and her ""sister"" are orphans) in this world is unbelievable. Especially when certain technologies are so readily available. Perhaps my mind was drowning under the many descriptions of Ren's races and not enough explanation as to why and how the world came to be as it is. I am a fan of racing, but the amount of it contained within THE WARD was overload even for me. I was quite literally drowning in it. (Pun intended.)And of course there has to be a love triangle... Well, sort of. Romance is there, but THE WARD is so boggled down with racing that the romance is instantly forgettable, much like the characters, and the world... Honestly, I was ready for the book to be over at about the halfway point. But seeing as it was my airplane read during a long trip and I had a few hours to spare, I stuck it through.At this point I am unsure whether or not I will pick up the final book in this two-part series, since I am still getting over my initial disappointment with THE WARD. Perhaps I will reconsider when I have had more time to absorb the blow to my extremely high expectations. But for now, THE WARD is not at the top of my list of recommended dystopians.BUT: If your expectations are not so high as mine and you like stories about orphans ""beating the system"", you may want to give this one a try. Just be sure to check it out from the library first.";1
131554;WOW is this book wordy.  I personally couldn't stand the fake conversations between Sarah and Gerber that make up about 30% of the book.  Very contrived, not engaging, and not particularly helpful.But the meat of the book is very valuable, especially if you are in the middle of running a business and have never done this type of analysis about your customers, your operations, your marketing, etc...  I am taking a business course that uses this book as one of the texts, and it has given me much guidance in building my management/operations guide for my three year old photography business.For me, the client fulfillment discipline was the most valuable, as I am in a highly competitive business and getting all of the systems in place to surprise and delight my customers, every time, is very important.;1
586992;"Echoing the sentiments of other great writers (Camus, Faulkner), O'Brian freely admits that happening-truth (actual events) is not always as reliable as story-truth, the notion of feelings being of far greater importance as a means of communicating the essence of an experience. In this admission, he sweeps aside conventional story-telling and asks his readers--without a doubt largely desensitized to the horrors of war--to really listen, to achieve the near-impossible: live the Vietnam War as a soldier, understand it as one, and go home with all its baggage. It is a highly ambitious task that O'Brian deftly and humbly manages.O'Brian also makes clear that without stories to recount the savagery and tragedies of war, we can be lost in the frayed parts of ourselves. It is the tale that keeps us whole, the tale that allows us an outlet for the tangle of emotions that threatens to unravel us. ""I was atrocity,"" O'Brian writes, ""I was jungle fire, jungle drums...I was the beast on their lips--I was Nam--the horror, the war."" Killing, whether to protect yourself or to hinder the enemy, getting revenge, fear, hope, trekking your things through the jungle, pictures of sweethearts--among these there is no difference. They are all one and the same. This loss of distinction is the loss of our humanity. Stories redraw the lines, give us needed definition. In all that aftermath of violence they allow us to find ourselves, to save ourselves. And this message is made more powerful when applied not just to the severity of war. Using stories in this way is possible for us all, the truth of ourselves, our salvation, lies within our own history, in our own unique stories.";1

142208;"If this book had a coherent topic I might have enjoyed it. It doesn't. It is supposedly about the explosion of Vesuvius in A.D. 79, the destruction of Herculaneum and Pompeii, and the social and cultural disruptions that followed. For reasons that are quite obscure the author rambles on for the first 127 pages about the origins of the universe, the origins of life, evolution, the appearance of the Big Dipper, panspermia, and more or less everything in between. Why? Who knows? Not me, and I read the book. He then prattles on about the slave revolt of Spartacus, which is at best tangentially relevant - but I guess he has a sense of humor, this chapter is called ""Then listen, Josephus, for I digress""- never a truer word. The sections on Vesuvius are gripping and follow a coherent narrative line, until Pellegrino wanders off into yet another massive digression in a disjointed discussion of Gnosticism in the early church.  I think the point was that the apocalyptic vision of early Christianity owed its origins to the calamitous explosion of Vesuvius, which is ingenious but he doesn't get even close to proving it, if only because nowhere are his arguments stated, it is all implication, imprecation and hand waving. We are then hurled through time to the sinking of the Titanic, an event that has nothing to do with Vesuvius, the Roman Empire, or volcanoes. The single point of comparison is the loss of life, and nothing in the Titanic chapters serves this book in any way whatsoever, pointless verbiage.  Pellegrino then sets off on a gratuitous discussion of the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York. The only link to Vesuvius that Pellegrino could muster was the shared physics of the collapse column in both a volcanic cloud and a falling building. I'd call that a stretch. Perhaps a more valid comparison would have been to talk to survivors of the atom bombs in Japan. Surprisingly, given that the book is about a volcanic explosion, there is no discussion of volcanic events in recent times- Krakatoa, Mount St. Helens, Etna. It is not even clear from the book that Vesuvius is still active, or that the Bay of Naples has been devastated by earthquakes in living memory. This is just lazy.  There are errors of fact, a message in a bottle thrown into the Atlantic seems to have washed up in Surrey, England, which is not a small feat since Surrey is a landlocked county with not an inch of shoreline (perhaps it floated up the river Thames?). Pellegrino appears to place the fall of Constantinople to around 535, which is nonsense. This is in the middle of the reign of Justinian I (527-565), who expanded the Byzantine Empire to include all the Mediterranean including Southern Spain, and who between 532 and 537 oversaw the building of the Sancta Sophia- one of the greatest churches ever constructed. These are hardly the signs of a dieing civilization. With inevitable ups and downs Constantinople remained the centre of a major Christian civilization until it fell to the Turks in 1453, whereupon it became the centre of a major Muslim civilization.  Finally, the style is clumsy with the same phrase frequently repeated in the same sentence, as in, (just one example of many) ""her first officer had (in a manner of speaking) given me a promise to keep and pointed me (in a manner of speaking) toward...""  It could have been a good book, it isn't.";1

121620;"When asked to define love, I could not find my tongue. I wished to expound on its nature. To praise a woman whose beauty has launched a thousand ships, and men have fought, and bled, and gotten sepsis and scurvy over. Perhaps Ovid said it best: ""Love, it is a kind of warfare."" Yes, just like a man to compare love with battle, but within the minds of men it is. We struggle with our pride, pay homage to our honor, and seek an answer in our hearts. But love isn't an action movie. We don't get to blow anything up or have car chases, and the only thing a man risks breaking is his heart.You meet the girl of your dreams and she's dead. No, make that undead, and, now surprise! You are a vampire too. Yes, love sucks, and Christopher Moore knows it. You Suck, a love story, is Moore's tenth novel and sequel to Blood Sucking Fiends, his third novel.Christopher Moore is an American writer of absurdist fiction. His novels typically involve an ordinary guy thrust into supernatural or extraordinary circumstances, and often touch on political, environmental, or social concerns. Think John Steinbeck mixed with Kurt Vonnegut. Nope, You Suck is not your typical vampire story.Jody, a single, red-headed woman living in San Francisco, is attacked by a vampire and soon realizes that she has become one herself. She never asked to be a vampire, but when she wakes up with a sore neck, superhuman strength, and a Nosferatuan thirst-well, it looks like her decision has been made for her. While trying to adjust to her newfound powers and nocturnal lifestyle, she is aided by C. Thomas Flood, better know as ""Tommy"". The ""C"" doesn't stand for anything, but it looks so much better as a byline.Yes, Tommy is an aspiring writer, fresh and naive from the heartland of America, who throws stock nights at a local grocery store, not to mention being a champion ""frozen turkey"" bowler. So, Jody and Tommy begin their life together as master and minion. One thing leads to another, and put it this way:vampirism has its perks. You live forever(barring unfortunate incidents with wooden stakes and Italian food), can turn to mist(no more locking yourself out of your car), and then there's vampire sex. But it has its downsides too. It's not all blood and roses-sunlight is death and blood lust makes you do some pretty foul things,not to mention how vampirism complicates love.Making the relationship work, however, is the least of Tommy's and Jody's problems. The vampire who nibbled on Jody wasn't supposed to be recruiting any new members into the club. Even worse, Tommy's former, partying-hard, turkey-bowling, co-working pals are out to get him, at the urging of a blue-dyed Las Vegas prostitute named Blue, and that really ""sucks"".Moore's writing is certainly fun and funny, ranking with other modern humorists like Douglas Adams, Tom Robbins and Terry Pratchett. His book titles alone merit a Pulitzer-such as The Island of the Sequined Love Nun, the Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove, Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal, and Practical Demonkeeping. Yet, like most humor, there's more than meets the eye. Moore has a certain way of writing about flawed people with great affection and forgiveness and isn't that something we could all use a little more of???Author of ""Hobo Finds A Home"" and editor ""Of A Predatory Heart""";1

560949;"This book is a perfect blend for the enterprise architect who is building a business case to replace legacy systems.  And in saying that, I'm going to misrepresent what this book is attempting to do.First of all, this book is not about the technologies of building a replacement system.  While they are discussed in a general way, you won't get advice about good/better technology choices.  Similarly, while this book gives examples of costs of legacy systems versus likely operational costs involved in replacement systems, it isn't designed to be the definitive guide (and I'm sure you can do better if you search in the ""MBA Section"" of your local bookstore).Instead, it is a guide to the enterprise architect to split out the technical domains versus the business domain so that you can functionally understand ways to divide a legacy system to build replacements that will be a better fit to business process and intended business function.This is actually practical advice.  The text doesn't attempt to show you how to use a Zachman or TOGAF for the process, instead, the text is wisely framework neutral and assumes that you at least can break the problem into a business domain versus a technical domain which, in my experience, is the difficult part of modernizing a legacy system.There is some advice on how to deal with legacy code bases, but probably not enough as a definitive guide.  Again, there are probably better texts on this.I would view this as a good text for the enterprise architect who has to deal with legacy transformation and giving you a mindset on how to proceed.  This is really a unique book and one that every EA should have on his/her list to read.My one disappointment is because the book doesn't deal with legacy data in a meaningful way.  My experience has been that you have to understand and deal with this issue almost immediately to fully comprehend the scope of a modernization effort.  But if you actually have the ability to read and understand this book, it won't lead you down the wrong path, it just won't have the information that you wish it had.  Also, there is little discuss on how business process improvements should drive modernization efforts.  But that is likely beyond the scope of this book.As others have pointed out, the book is primarily about case studies, and each takes a different mindset towards modernization.  It is welcome because each modernization effort is unique and this has a lot of different approaches to take.  I said at the beginning this is useful in building a business case for legacy modernization, and it is in the sense that this will give you the tools to build a model to determine CapEx and OpEx for legacy and potential replacement systems.  That will make the discussion much easier with the CFO!Hats off to Ulrich & Newcomb on this text, this is good stuff.[again, I caution if you are a programmer, this is not the best text to understand legacy code modernization, this is an architecture driven approach to the problem]";1
157031;You want to know what MBA's learn? But, you know you can't spend 2 years and a fortune to acquire that knowledge? Fear not! The 10 day MBA is your mini-MBA course. You wouldn't learn everything that the MBA student learns in those 2 years, but, you would learn almost all the essential concepts.Author Steven Silbiger presents all the concepts of taught in most b-schools in a very readable format. A definite must-read for all managers, entrepreneurs and the hopeful millions who see themselves managing their own or somebody else's business very soon.Now the complaint (or rather the justification for 4* instead of a 5*): The author probably presents the material in the SAME SEQUENCE that he studied it during his b-school years. This makes the book a collection of essays on the various topics of business management rather than an integrated approach to business management. I would love to see a more integrative approach on how the various concepts mesh together in real-world business situations.;1
71881;"The challenge I have with Patrick Robinson's books is that I absolutely cannot stand his childish political jabs.  This book at least was not as bad in that regard, except that the most liberal character that was portrayed in a somewhat positive light got killed off.  I am a liberal Democrat and I believe in a strong U.S. Navy, so I find Robinson's political posturing to be insulting - and it is unnecessarily and unfoundedly antagonistic.  If I set aside Robinson's frankly idiotic political nonsense, then I usually enjoy the story and the details.  I agree with some reviewers that Robinson can be a bit repetitive about some things - like who cares the 100th time about ""buckshot"" in coffee!  But that is minor.  Some characters are reasonably well developed and overall I enjoyed this particular book.  It was a good read while at the beach.";1

199748;"""We Were Soldiers Once...And Young"" is the account of how close Hal Moore as well as his soldiers came to being massacred. The numbers are spine-chilling: In four days of battle --- with hostile forces at times as near as 75 feet to the American line --- 234 Americans passed in battle. In this extraordinary minute-by-minute record, you get to know these soldiers. And sadly: You see every man die in battle.Keep In Mind the state of one's affairs. Americans originally were advisers in Vietnam, they had never battled the hostile forces. Moore was a career Army: West Point, Korea, advanced studies in fast-moving, guerrilla combat. In June of l965, he began instructing his unit for conflict in Vietnam. In August, the Army removed each and every one of his newly-acquired second lieutenants. In August, all enlisted men that had 60 days or fewer of service were taken out of the 7th Cavalry. the result was that when Moore and his men get under way to Vietnam, they had by that time been deprived of 100 of their most experienced soldiers.The distinguishing characteristic between an under-trained company, that withstands brutal combat, and one that turns out to become legendary in its loss, is leadership. Take Into Consideration a few of the methods Moore managed his soldiers. He told his unit:--- ""Only first-place trophies will be displayed, accepted or presented in this battalion. Second place in our line of work is defeat of the unit on the battlefield, and death for the individual in combat.""--- ""Decision-making will be decentralized: Push the power down. It pays off in wartime.""--- ""Loyalty flows down as well.""--- ""I check up on everything. I am available day or night to talk to any officer of this battalion.""Before the fight began, James Galloway was paying attention to Moore's men shaving as he heated water for coffee one day before the battle. Moore passed by. ""We all shave in my outfit --- reporters included,"" he barked. Galloway right away repurposed his coffee water for shaving.Moore arrived in to Ia Drang on the front helicopter. He led his unit into battle from the line of battle. When he would catch sight of soldiers from a separate company beginning to pull one of his deceased men out of a foxhole with a harness, he would bark, ""No you won't do that. He's one of my troopers, and you will show some respect. Get two more men and carry him to the landing zone."" When it was over, and it was time for Moore to turn over command, he requested a full battalion formation. One soldier recalls, ""We stood in formation, with some units hardly having enough men to form up. Colonel Moore spoke to us and he cried. At that moment, he could have led us back into the Ia Drang.""Moreover managed to lead by example back home while he and his men wee on the battlefield. His wife went to as many funerals as she was able to attend. And when he got back to the U.S. in April 1966, he visited the families of his deceased soldiers. One family believed his call would last a few minutes. He visited five hours. He also went with the family to pay a visit to the burial place, and there he asked to spend some time in solitude, bending in prayer and remembrance.This account --- the story of the connection of an officer to the soldiers he watched over and the families that sent those young soldiers to be in his charge --- is why you need to read this book. If you are a manager responsible for employees or if you are a parent fighting the good fight of raising your children, you above any other readers will be capable of reading through the darkness and death and know why Moore's soldiers fought and died for him.If you are ever be in Washington, D.C., the names of the men who died in battle at Ia Drang can be seen on the third panel to the right of the summit, Panel-3 East, of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. When lived in Baltimore for seven years I once took my boys to that wall and we stood in silence and awe. I encourage you to do the same and to read this book.";1

I didn't even go see it! Did not follow the book at all! And the book was a true story!The father is a big man and made his money by saving people time. For example doctor's in surgery now use the nurse's to pass them their tools, look at your keyboard he put the letters in their postion,and there might have been a new way to remove tonsils, but that is a story you'll have to read in the book.The mother grew up in a rich family. She was easily frightend but she wasn't a scardy cat either. She went along with the father's ideas and fully supported him.The kids all learned the value of time. They also loved pratical jokes and were like any other kid. The older girls were embarrassed by their little siblings.Well I really enjoyed the book! Hope this helped!;1

346131;"What a treasure of a small book this is.  I stayed up into the wee hours of the night because I just couldn't tear myself away from the story of Viola and Lucy and how they operated in the world. To say that Adriana Trigiani benefited from having them as grandmothers is an understatement.I loved that both grandmothers had a strong interest in some area of dressmaking.  Viola in the heart and hard work of factory sewing, and then her own blouse-making business, and Lucy in her devotion to clients and perfection when she became a ""storefront couturier."" Talented and beautiful women, they understood the value and power behind a women dressed well in perfectly fitted, classic clothing.  They also understood that keeping up their skin/beauty routine, social standing and family reputations were tantamount to good life, good health and good self-esteem, among other important things.It seems Adriana learned so much from them about integrity and self-respect, there's no doubt about that.  But, she also learned the value of manners, of going after what you want, of having a purpose in life, of minding your reputation.  The specifics of these lessons are ones you'll be delighted to read.I thought it was delightful and serious at the same time to read Lucy's lessons first on romantic love, then on keeping a marriage strong.  Hers is practical wisdom.  Her instructions on raising children are some we absolutely could use today.  I particularly liked her dictum never to burden a child with adult problems.  That lesson alone would change the mental health of so many children in these times.There is so much to this book.  It's humorous, it's character building, it's serious and it's a lesson book on how to live a life with wisdom.  What a blessing Adriana Trigiani had in these two lovely women.  No wonder she's a bestselling author with fragments of these things to share with her readers.Those of us who had grandmothers like Viola and Lucy will enjoy reading about them and, possibly, taking a nostalgic trip back to our own childhoods.  Those of you who didn't have grandmothers like them will gain something very special in the reading.5 perfectly heartwarming stars";1

I was eager to turn the page and learn more about what Mortensen's next project was going to be.Unfortunately, at the last chapter, the authors present their simplistic political views of the shortcomings of American foreign policy.Neveretheless and undeniably, Mortensen's work has produced real benefits for the girls and women of Pakistan and Afghanistan - which is to be lauded, despite doctrinal points of view of how Bush and Rumsfeld, and the Pentagon, have 'failed' to rebuild Afghanistan.As a cultural introduction to the people, highly recommended otherwise.Update 25 May 2011:This book and the author have recently been coming under criticism for being a fraudulent work of fiction.

Surprisingly, Snicket teaches a very important and mature lesson, that not everything is always seen as black or white, but sometimes people are percieved as gray (or a tossed chef's salad!)  I found that lesson to be very important for the story and I congratulate Snicket for wanting to make the story mature along with the Baudelaires as well.

93624;"""Dilbert"" has been my favorite comic strip for years, with its consistently funny corporate humor, but ""Way of the Weasel"" offers even more. Scott Adams contributes truly insightful revelations into the world of the manipulative mindset, and in doing so has provided a valuable reference source. A person could do worse than to arm himself with this information before confronting a financial advisor, or car salesman, or others of their ilk. Unlike conventional ""how-to"" or other ""advice"" books (weasely materials themselves), ""Way of the Weasel"" contains no fat, as Adams cuts right to the chase. I suspect that those who dislike this book are manipulators who resent being caught. Take heed, you weasels, Scott Adams has your number! And don't let me forget to mention how this book reminds me how happy I am to have taken an Early Retirement a year ago, chump change pension notwithstanding. I wish Adams were available to represent the rights of workers in arbitration proceedings...";1
627299;The combination of The Acharnians, The Clouds, and Lysistrata is terrific. It would make for a great course on Aristophanes. Alan Sommerstein's translation, supplemented by his introduction and notes, makes Aristophanes not just accessible but fun, as comedy should be.;1
628596;"If you weren't convinced before, you soon will be:  Reading to your child is the most important gift you can give!  The first part of the Trelease's text is an inspired mix of scientific proof and anecdotal evidence about the life-changing nature of reading to children.  I particularly liked his encouragement of reading to older kids and teenagers! It's a fun read, even if you are already committed to reading as part of your parenting style (as we were).The last section of this book is a good, though by no means exhaustive, list of literature that is appropriate for reading aloud to various aged children.  Lots of good picks here, though some of my old favorites were missing, alas.Trelease also mentions that comic books are a great way to get kids to start reading, but then doesn't give enough information about appropriate reads for kids.  Since most of the comic market today is adult oriented, it would be helpful for most folks to have more guidance in this area.  There are wonderful comic book titles appropriate for kids out there like ""Akiko"", ""Leave it to Chance"",  ""Bone"" -- even kid versions of old favorites like ""Batman Adventures"" and ""Justice League Adventures"".  Your local comic book store will point you in the right direction, but since  the comic medium is such a great intro for the beginning reader, he could have included more information.";1
326932;When I finished this book, I felt moved, I felt entertained, I felt satisfied.  But mostly I felt hope.  This lovely book tells the tale of three troubled people whose chance encounter changes all of them for the better. The plot is simple, a lonely divorcee and her young son invite an escaped convict to stay with them, but the emotions that come into play are complex and heartwrenching.  Maynard never sugarcoats the problems these people have, yet as you end the book, you believe that one generous human being can make a real difference in the world.  Maybe that's not true.  Maybe I was so moved by the book because that's what I want to believe.  Fair enough.  But the time I spent reading this magical little book made me hold to that belief for just a little longer.  In this troubled world, that's good enough for me.;1

385516;"The main character in this book is Amelia, and she's dead. So if you don't want to read a story with a ghost protagonist then this book isn't for you. On the other hand, I don't really consider this a ""ghost story."" Amelia is not spooky or scary. She's a girl trying to figure out what happened to her. I read this like fiction, just like I would a story with wizards, vampires, or talking animals.I was enthrolled with the story line at the very beginning, it's so unique. The writing is beautiful. Amelia is 18 ""living"" near an Oklahoma river she drowned in and has been in a mental haze since her death. Then one day she helps rescue a boy named Joshua from drowning in the same river. Her life gains some meaning. Joshua can see and touch Amelia. The love story is so great. Joshua is so charming and sweet. He could have run away screaming that he saw a ghost, but instead he builds a beautifully unique friendship.The bad guy in the book is so intriguing, but he is also extremely creepy and scary. There aren't a lot of other side characters since no one else can see, hear, or touch Amelia. The focus of the book is the romance. There was some profanity in this book, see my content ratings for details.I really enjoyed Hereafter. I'm looking forward to the release of book two in the series! Arise is expected to be released on June 5th, 2012.";1

136846;Christopher Moore has to be one of the most brilliantly bizarre people on the planet. Either he was dropped on his head as a small child or he was touched by the literary gods (I'm betting both). Moore does it once again  in ISLAND. He presents quirky characters, a zany plot and absolutely  hilarious dialogue. I couldn't put this book down! I carried it with me  everywhere until I finished it, and I often was the object of curious  stares as I guffawed my way through the reading in public places.Moore has a knack for creating the bizarre. Tucker Case, hero of  ISLAND, finds himself in a &quot,sticky&quot, situation (you'll understand  the pun once you read the novel) one evening while &quot,entertaining&quot,  a young lady in the cockpit of his plane. From there on, the novel is  nonstop hilarity as Case first runs away from the law and then has to run  for his life. He finds himself on an island with natives fascinated by  Americana, bored druggie pseudo-missionaries out to exploit the island, and  a transvestite with a sunglass-wearing bat as a pet. Case just wants to  save his hide but finds himself as the hero time and again.It's  difficult to place Moore into any particular genre. Part fantasy, part  comedy, part sci fi, part horror, part drama....If you read nothing else  this year, pick up any of Moore's novels. All of them are well worth your  time.;1

602211;"As another reviewer mentioned, I hadn't realized that this was written in halves by different authors, but it's quite obvious when you read the book. The first half is fantastic, enough to be a great buy in of its own right. But when we get to later in the book, particularly Clinton, it just goes downhill fast. A book that I'd found riveting turned into something that I didn't even see the point in finishing. Why? The writing went from an impartial and information-packed presentation of the facts and underlying themes to something which was sloppy, partial, and included a whole lot of extraneous facts. Why do I rank it four-star, then? Because the first half (and even about 30% of the second half, so about 80% of the book) is just that good. And the knowledge I've gained from it has really permeated my life and proven valuable, from understanding Eisenhower references on the Daily Show to catching the variation of the ""Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy"" quote in the vice-presidential debates. I highly recommend this book...just come warned that the last 100 pages in the 500 page book, while not useless, come close.";1

388455;"I've become wary of starting new dystopian series because I always wonder ""Will this book live up to the last one? Will it stand out?""  Thankfully Eve completely drew me in and delivered on its promise to be a unique and thrilling adventure.Eve is quite the intelligent young woman.  When the novel opens, her graduation day is right around the corner and she's got the honor of graduating at the very top of her class. On almost a whim (and to prove a disparaging classmate wrong), Eve sneaks out of the dorm at night and swims across the lake to look at the ""wonderful"" place that she will be moving to after graduation--the magical place where she will finally be able to take up her trade.  What she discovers there is absolutely beyond  belief--a room full of young women, pregnant and strapped down.  When she returns, clearly shaken by the experience and her discovery, a sympathetic adult helps her to escape through the wall, leaving behind her friends and the only life that she's ever known.Eve is a character that I think readers will bond with right away.  Her attachment to the memory of her mother as well as her two close friends make her likeable and realistic.  Her naivete is completely reasonable because you know from the start that she's never known anything else.  Seeing the world through Eve's eyes really drew me into the story and I could sympathize with her apprehensions as she struggled to make sense of new truths and survive in the harsh world outside of the school.When Even is rescued by Caleb, we're introduced to a whole new cast of characters.  Caleb is awesome.  He was patient when it came to Eve's misconceptions about men and the world, but he wasn't afraid to tell her what was reality and what was a lie fed to her by the school.  It's really no surprise that Eve bonds with him so well and I enjoyed watching their sweet romance blossom over time.  While I loved watching Even and Caleb together, it was her interactions with the very young boys--teaching them to read and write--that really made my heart melt. It's so obvious that these little boys are looking for a loving maternal figure in their lives and Eve is truly the perfect fit.So many things happen that I want to tell you about, but I refuse to ruin this one for you!  This book is a fabulous combination of action and sweet romance with an ending that will leave you speechless (and if you're like me, in tears). I can't wait to read more in this series!";1
321336;"I liked this book far more than I expected to.It's really a book of personal observations, supported by a little bit of research, as one woman looks out her back window at the deer who frequent her yard in the winter. It doesn't sound like much, and in the end it really isn't--her observations lead to conclusions that humanize the deer, but don't give a lot of ""hard facts"" or otherwise add to the scientific knowledge of the species. In addition, the whole exercise feels a little artificial, after all, she's feeding these deer, so her very actions are luring them into an artificial situation.Still, it's a good read. The observations themselves are intriguing, and the author's style is light and readable. The book itself is thin, so about the time this exercise in deerspotting gets a little tiresome, the book is nearly over anyway. In the end, one is left with one woman's insights into these beautiful creatures, and a curiosity to find out more.";1

386899;This is a story of a bastard child 'Grier' lately recognized by her low born but rich father. Armed with a huge dowry she belatedly (28 year) enters the marriage market, along with her half sister in similar circumstance. After encountering several instances of snobbish behaviour, the unkind words of an empoverished prince from a small European principality describing her unsuitability as a prospective bride, result in Grier tipping her drink on his head in retribution. From there the relationship between these two unlikely partners develops as they find themselves in similar circles.There are two  important aspects of the book that fail to engage me as a reader. The first is that the extremely unlikely pairing of a working class bastard with a prince in an historical romance would need to be tackled in a way that reflected the unique situation. For me the encounters are too contrived and reliant on behaviour that would be unacceptable both due to their respective stations and her restrictions due to being a woman. Reference alone to the unlikely aspects of this story aren't enough.The second problem I had was with the two lead characters. Grier was extremely immature for a 28 year old woman. The fact that she had experienced some of the harsher aspects of life simply did not gel with the personality more suitable to a spoiled 17 year debutante. Constant attempts to remind herself of the inexcusably rude and crude behaviour of the prince toward herself fluctuated with an undeniable attraction that lead her to even make sexual advances toward him in cringe worthy scenes make this character crudely unrealistic. The male lead 'Sevastian' was a carbon copy cold boorish male with little to distinguish himself, apart from the given title and his looks. Both characters left me disinterested as to how this story would enfold.;1
36287;"Great read but why stop? I don't see how one broken down, disfunctional ""DIVERGENT"" group can cure a whole society of broken down amoral people ""outside the fence""  This reminds me of Multiple Personality Disorder. The mind copes with traumatic, unsolvable, incompatible events in childhood by splitting off into seperate factions each with its own personality, morality, religion, traits etc. This is a major problem in adulthood. It causes confusion, blackouts, insanity and great pain that must be dealt with to survive. I thought Veronica Roth was going to solve this by ""sharing information"" faction to faction to unite the factions into one whole unit. Instead she leaves the ending in a mess!! Better be a sequel.";1
385886;"""A Scandalous Scot"" is the first book by Karen Ranney that I have read.  I usually don't care for period piece romance but this one seemed interesting from the blurb.  I'm glad I took the chance.  The plot is fairly thin but the writer's style and turn of phrase is excellent.While I enjoyed the main story, the sideline about the sister's ruin was less inviting.  I found that to be a little trite.  On the other hand, the relationship which grew between Morgan and Jean was really lovely. To be honest, there was a little too much sex and graphically described for my taste, but I simply skipped over it in the later chapters without too much difficulty.";1
180104;Bottom Line: no astounding new fashion revelations, reads like an advice column geared towards the 20-something crowd.This book addresses the very basics of the principles of dressing in the most general way, with advice thrown in on drinking, not exercising, and posing for pictures.  The catty, somewhat cliche tone Danica Lo uses makes this book feel more like you're reading a gossip blog than a fashion how-to (read: more gossipy than helpful).  Overall, this book is pretty run-of-the-mill.There are parts of this book I found useful - the 3 page chapter on scientific scent, for example.Anyway, beyond the occasional smirk-inducing line, there is not much here.  Hope this helps!;1
193291;"I have been a fan of Larry Gonick`s work for years ever since I first stumbled onto his Cartoon Guide to Statistics.  He covers a subject the way it should be covered-historically.  Innovations in science and math have moved along together in a historical time line.  It was this historical approach that made Carl Sagan's Cosmos series one of the greatest innovations in the effort to popularize science.I have long said that we teach science backward.  We still teach on a 19th Century model.  We start with biology, then chemistry, and finally physics.Even when I was in high school, I wished that I could take physics before chemistry.  Before I was elected as a school board director, I was on our district's Gifted Advisory Council.  I made the suggestion that we teach physics before chemistry and, then, biology last.  I was immediately shot down by one of the other parents on the basis that sophomores do not have the math courses under their belts to tackle physics.  So why not teach the math along with the science?  Integrate it.  (No, that would make it too relevant.)I felt vindicated when a friend of mine reported that she attended a lecture by a Nobel laureate making the same assertion that I had been making for years-we teach science backwards.  After all, the toughest course out there is biochemistry-at least that is what every med student I know has ever said.  And biochemistry is the new frontier for blockbuster innovations-nano-technology not being the least of these frontiers.Gonick underscores my assertion about teaching physics first, because in this book on chemistry, he introduces quantum mechanics, which is normally taught as physics, on page 28.Don't let he word ""cartoon"" in Larry Gonick`s books fool you into thinking that these are easy fluff surveys of the subjects involved.  He makes each subject accessible while being entertaining, but each book stands on its own as a complete basic survey course of the subject.So when I needed to add about two dollars to my order to get free shipping, it took me about thirty seconds to find my book.  I went right to Larry Gonick.";1
449790;These three themes are interwoven in Schoenewaldt&#8217,s highly readable and informative novel about immigrants in Cleveland in the early twentieth century. The story wears its author&#8217,s research lightly, fitting historical facts naturally into the tale of Lucia D&#8217,Angelo, her tempestuous mother, and her friends and acquaintances among the exploited immigrant population. Narrated in the first person, the story hangs on Lucia, who is smart, ambitious, lonely, full of questions, and apparently pretty. Schoenewaldt&#8217,s writing doesn&#8217,t milk the reader for emotions &#8212, she is much better than that, writing in a lean, kinetic style in which vividly described actions allow the reader to bring his or her own emotions to the scene, and she is brilliant at including the telling detail. Her literary skills save this romantically titled novel (probably the publisher&#8217,s choice) from being gushy or sensationalistic, although it has its share of injustice, tragedy, and &#8220,boy troubles.&#8221, Like Lucia herself, who matures and changes through the course of six or so years, most of the characters are complex and capable of surprising us, such as her first English-language teacher, Miss Miller. Some are despicable, such as the factory boss who rapes women employees in his office. Others are exclusively noble and good, such as Henryk, the object of Lucia&#8217,s thwarted desire, and the soothing Paulo, not to mention the earth-mother Lula, but don&#8217,t most of us know people we admire to the point of seeing them in only one dimension? All of these characters are viewed through the personality of the novel&#8217,s protagonist, and the likable Lucia is an excellent guide through a period of American history that helped workers enjoy what rights and privileges we have today.;1
94204;"This is my first from Gennita Low. I was so enthusiastic to read it because of glossy reviews. What a disappointment... This is a US government suspense. Consequently,  the main idea was good in the beginning. The factor of ethnic flavour (the heroin is Asian) is also something new in this genre.[...] Ms Low repeats every single detail so many times that that made me almost thrown up. After some time I gave up counting to read how many times the bad guys tortured, raped etc. the heroin. How can it be possible to have operated perfectly after what happened her skin, face, body? Plastic surgery has lots of limitations Ms. Low.Actually I found the heroin totally dumbfounded. The hero is irritating and his fetish about long long hair is gross.Is it really possible if a person really is unaware of herself throughout 10 years and then remembers everything in bed with her ""husband""?This book needs a good editing, but it is too late. Normally Avon is quite precise in this matters, perhaps they were in a hurry. Despite what I wrote, I am planning to give this author another try, maybe I will order her first or next work. I hope she improves herself in writing, as I mentioned before she has some great ideas.[...]";1
459846;I was pleasantly surprised by this fast-moving mystery. The novel opens with Amelia's unexpected death and a surprising text message to her mom that it wasn't suicide. The story then alternates between the young adult perspective of Amelia in the weeks leading up to her death, and that of her distraught mother, who unravels the mystery, as she pines through months of Facebook posts, text messages and emails.This was a great page turner with several great plot twists that I didn't predict. I really got to know and like Amelia as I read about her navigating her teenage life, and I found myself almost wishing the book would end with her still alive. It was difficult to read about her mother's grief at losing her only child. The characters in this story were really well-developed, and the social media aspect made it believable in a society where we are all so addicted to staying connected online.I won ARC as part of a First Reads Giveaway hosted by Goodreads. While I was excited to be a winner, I was afraid I wouldn't like the book. But I must say, in her debut novel, Kimberley McCreight delivered an awesome page turner! I am looking forward to her next release!;1

It describes the inner workings of these groups--the Communist and Mob-like ""cells"" at the heart of the movement, which set  goals and strategies, and which, operating in secret, direct the messages carried through  sprawling mega-churches, to reach almost every aspect of a family's life--spiritual, social, political, educational, and even nutritional.

637009;A precocious child tries to come to grips with the death of his father on 9/11 juxtaposed with the life and death struggle of his family during the destruction of Dresden. Foer definitely does not lack courage in taking on these tragedies and there are times that you will be transported into a post 9/11 New York City and truly feel the emotional pain that was left in the aftermath of the destruction. There is also an intriguing collection of images that will puzzle and enlighten throughout the novel, which while not entirely a new innovation, works very well here and truly adds to the scope and depth of this work.It is in Oskar Schell, the 9 year old focus of this novel, that I felt Foer falls short. Unlike other precocious protagonists like Irving's Owen Meany, Oskar's shrill nature and overly mannered personality wears thin after awhile and as he is at the center of much of the novel it was a flaw I couldn't quite get around. There is so much value to this work that I recommend it, but poor little Oskar, who should have been compelling, was instead a pain.;1

I watch them praise an action they perform, and reprimand a subordinate for the same behavior. I needed to understand these thought processes that allow a person to rationalize their actions and distrust everyone else.This book provides great examples of this behavior in celebrities. And the author approaches the celebrity subjects as one of the billions of humans on the planet, and doesn't treat them as ""special"" people. In fact, he finds that celebrities being treated AS special makes their narcissism more difficult to treat.  And the chapter detailing what core personality type goes into show-biz is eye-opening. Basically, ""They're not self-centered because they're celebrities. They became celebrities because they needed constant praise.""The book also describes the negative effect the media/celebrity complex has on teens, and ways to prevent it.I expected this book to be interesting, but I didn't expect it to be solid psychology.

311672;Perhaps your reaction to this book will rest on how you feel about the election of Barack Obama, because he comes across as the finest candidate in the 2008 election. He has his doubts, makes his mistakes, shows his inexperience, but if the authors' reporting is complete, he was the candidate best able to recover from those mistakes, depend on his spouse, work the hardest (although Hillary Clinton seems close here), manage good relations with a large staff, and hit the right notes. And it paid off.I'm not sure how useful it is to reveal the various affairs of the candidates and their spouses or their petty reactions to their rivals, but that is one of the main attractions of this book. As someone who followed the election very closely, it was fun to recall the ups and downs of the primaries, then the general election, and the rhythms here ring true. I'm not crazy about the authors' attempts to report the internal reactions of various players, there's a lot of sleaziness, as you might expect.For my money, Hunter Thompson's Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail is the truest account of a political campaign (Nixon/McGovern,1972) even if a lot of it was not straight reporting. Theodore White (The Making of a President for various races) was more decorous if less compelling.If nothing else, Game Change did nothing to convince me I should have voted for someone else.;1

183297;"In the 1960's facing the cruel conditions of institutionalization and coercive psychiatry, writers such as R.D. Laing, Ken Kesey and Thomas Szasz commented on real oppression but took a swerve in the opposite direction. As a person with mental illness, I cannot agree with what Thomas Szasz is saying. Yes medication has horrific side effects. Yes coercion is wrong.  Yes some people are diagnosed with a mental illness who have psychological problems (but in another book he is opposed to talk therapy as well, what isn't this guy opposed to?), yes some people are given medication who could do without it, yes there are new diagnoses that are not credible (road rage) but mental illness does exist. Denying mental illness and then saying the insanity defense should be eliminated because of course people did it according to their own volition (according to Szasz's reasoning) is a classic extreme libertarian viewpoint, stating firmly what is wrong but failing to come up with humanitarian alternatives. Read any book by Judi Chamberlin (a real life consumer/survivor) or track down the movie Hurry Tommorow (about the horrific conditions in an institution from the point of view of the ""patients"") instead of this dated, academic, dully written excercise in philosophy that detracts from the people it is supposedly championing.";1

336847;"""I could not think of a single thing I would have done differently over the past year, even over the past several years. Each of those things had led me to this moment --- to be walking back into a hospital that, in another life, I would have avoided like a structure fire. Returning to a ward that contained not even a single bar of soap, preparing to spend another night with two young boys whose language I did not speak, about to suggest some fantastically unsanitary food for dinner. This was where I belonged. That realization brought me immense comfort.""~Conor GrennanReviewing a book written by an author who has accomplished an extraordinary feat --- in this case, first rescuing dozens of Nepali children from human traffickers and uniting them with their families, then forming an international non-profit organization to carry out his work --- is no simple matter. For unlike authors of fiction, he must be ""judged"" according to his impact on the world and on how well he relays the story of his experiences. Otherwise, why would we pick up the book in the first place? It's hard not to see immediately that both Grennan's journey and his achievements are inspiring. But it's also a relief to discover that in addition to conveying a fascinating tale of real-life adventure and touting Grennan's passion for a noteworthy cause, LITTLE PRINCES showcases his winning sense of humor, immense humility and downright charm.Part of what makes LITTLE PRINCES so valuable --- and different from some other do-gooder memoirs or travelogues of its ilk --- is Grennan's willingness to be honest about his motives at every turn. No, he wasn't planning on changing the world when he first conceived of the trip. In fact, his initial three-month stint at the Little Princes Children's Home in Godawari, Nepal, was really just an excuse to quit his job at the East-West Institute in Prague in exchange for a solo year-long tour around the world (not to mention a tactic to impress women he met in bars). ""Who would dare begrudge my year of fun after doing something like that?"" he recalls. ""If I caught any flak for my decision to travel, I would have a devastating comeback ready, like: `Well, frankly Mom, I didn't peg you for someone who hates orphans.""'See? Honest. Funny.What's more, when then-29-year-old Grennan arrived in decade-long civil war-torn Nepal in 2004, he wasn't immediately invigorated by suddenly finding himself in a rough-and-tumble situation, nor was he even slightly prepared for what he would find there. A country under siege by Maoist rebels fighting against an oppressive royal Nepalese government. An impoverished population living in unsanitary conditions, without running water, toilets, or electricity. An entrenched child-trafficking scheme basically aided and abetted by both sides. No, in actuality, he was pretty freaked out. ""What I wanted was to tell people I had volunteered in an orphanage. Now that I was actually here, the whole idea of my volunteering in this country seemed ludicrous.""Humble.But the more you read of LITTLE PRINCES, the easier it is to see that Grennan --- maybe in spite of himself --- is a survivor, a thinker-on-his-feet, a person who knows a learning experience when he sees it and runs with it, and most of all, a realist. Yes, he bonded with the children at the home while he was there. Sure, he adjusted to ""Nepali time"" and simpler living. But he also recognized an invaluable truth about the situation before leaving Nepal for the first time: ""The deeper sadness, the deluge of emotion, came from admitting I was walking out on them... Despite myself, I had become a parent to these kids --- not because I was qualified, but because I had showed up.""Perhaps it was this simple epiphany that changed Grennan's life and the lives of hundreds and (hopefully) soon-to-be thousands of Nepalese children.Over the next three years, he would return to Nepal many times. After discovering that the children who lived at Little Princes weren't orphans, but rather kids who were either stolen outright or donated to traffickers by parents hoping to protect them from being inducted into the Maoist rebel army, Grennan and Farid --- a friend and fellow volunteer --- vowed to do what they could to help reverse child trafficking in Nepal. Along with trusted guides, he (quite literally) hiked for days through the Himalayas to remote villages in order to track down parents. He formed an international nonprofit called Next Generation Nepal, an organization dedicated to reconnecting these trafficked kids with their communities. He partnered with another international organization, the Umbrella Foundation, to buy a home where newfound ""orphans"" could live fear-free. He shuttled back and forth between his rented apartment in Nepal and his apartment in New York so he could raise thousands of dollars for his cause. And most of all, he was a parent to these kids when they presumably didn't have any.All this from a guy who professed never to truly know what he was doing at any point in the game. When describing a particular fundraising party, he writes: ""The fundraisers were the first moments I realized I was actually going to do this... We would search the hills and mountains of Nepal, in some of the most remote regions in the world, until we found the families of trafficked children. People clapped. I did not add that I might be completely full of crap.""For all these reasons and more (maps! stunning photos!), LITTLE PRINCES is quite possibly one of the most impassioned yet straightforward true tales you'll have the pleasure of reading. No need for a comparison to Greg Mortenson's THREE CUPS OF TEA --- this one stands well on its own. Plus, if any of the above didn't grab your attention, there's something else to look forward to. Grennan falls in love, too.For more information on Next Generation Nepal (and no, this plug wasn't prompted by his publisher), check out [...] After reading the book, you'll want to find out more, I promise.--- Reviewed by Alexis Burling";1
57037;"Just like the young adult series ""Gregor the Overlander"", Neil Gaiman's clever adult fantasy ""Neverwhere"" takes you way down below the surface of a major city, and reveals a world far different to ours - a more dangerous world, where nothing is what it seems, nobody is who they appear to be, and the smells are even worse.This highly imaginative and captivating story takes place in, below and between the streets of London, and starts when hapless Richard Mayhew is on his way to dinner with his fianc&eacute,e and her boss, a powerful media tycoon.  As fate would have it, a bedraggled, injured young girl comes between him and his fiancee's plans for his future, and before he can focus his thoughts he is deeply involved in an underworld plot that he can't begin to understand, much less extricate himself.Colorful characters, dark humor and punny place names highlight the story, and the two really bad guys Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar are the best of the lot. The girl of course is far more important to the scheme of things than one would believe, and as the last known survivor of a family massacre, her special talent is in high demand, particularly to Croup and Vandemar's employer.With reluctant Richard, an Amazonian bodyguard, and a cunning con man named the Marquis of Carabas, the girl, with the unlikely name of Door, sets out on a quest to find out who wanted her family killed, and why.  Their journey takes them to a floating market that changes location each market day, through sewers, unused Underground railway stations, a monastery of Black Friars, through a labyrinth, and to an angel named Islington.Richard learns the hard way how to save himself from himself, and emerges from the living nightmare a much stronger and dirtier person. By the conclusion, he knows that home is where the heart is, and there's no place like home.Amanda Richards, September 18, 2005";1
435260;Billy is a six year old boy, living with his parents.  Billy loves animals, to the point of being fixated on them.  He intersperses animal facts into everyday conversations.  On a trip to a local park, Billy, while acting like an animal, runs away from his father.  This incident escalates when a stranger, disapproving of the method Billy's father chooses for reprimanding the boy, turns the family in to child protective services.  From there, things escalate at an alarming rate.I really wanted to like this book.  The concept of the book was pretty brilliant, I think, in showing the story from the child's point of view.  However, Billy proves to be an unreliable, and often unlikable, narrator.  Aspects of the narration that are meant to be charming, such as Billy's word confusion and his inability to stay on topic, end up being very annoying and distracting.  I have read other books using a child as a narrator where it is done in an engaging and endearing way.  This leads me to believe it is not the child as narrator technique I dislike, but rather the way it is executed in this book.I find it very hard to connect with Billy as a character, despite the fact that his is the main voice in the story.  His fixation on animals made the narrative rather sprawling, and at times difficult to follow, because he would go off on frequent tangents.  Also, I found the child to be a bit of a brat and rather tiresome.I am left torn regarding the action of the story.  I am unable to determine if I should be angry that the family is put through this ordeal based simply on the nonsensical ramblings of a child and the observations of a stranger, or whether the child protection agency handles the situation appropriately.  Since Billy proves to be an unreliable narrator, I am left wondering what really did happen in this family.  But then I realize I was never engaged enough in the book to actually care.;1

There is just so much suspense and action the whole book is like a live nerve.  And aside from the thrilling ride those 3 embark on as they try to hide from the US authorities and figure out what to do next, all while fighting off attacks by Mogs, we also get introduced to number Seven and her story.This second installment is just filled with twists, as plot revelations are made and new players are introduced. Some of which I did see coming and quite a few, I'll admit, knocked me on my butt. Intrigued by some of the new characters and surprised by some of the life and death choices that are made by a couple of the original characters, THE POWER OF SIX owned me all the way to the end. And speaking of the end... Get ready for an ending that is fantastic and frustrating... for THE POWER OF SIX has one heck of a cliffhanger.;1

183689;"It's not often that I read memoirs, they seem, as a genre, somewhat too self-indulgent for me to spending several hundred pages mulling over at a time.  I think I remember mentioning this to a friend of mine shortly after I graduated high school, a friend whose passion for books mirrored my own and who genuinely appreciated my interest in nineteenth-century German philosophy.  In response to what I told him of the memoir, he mentioned the name of Annie Dillard, and said that I might like ""An American Childhood"" and ""Pilgrim at Tinker Creek.""  I shelved these suggestions, so to speak, not thinking of them too much in the intervening ten years.  And then, a few months ago, I saw a pristine copy of ""An American Childhood"" resting all by itself on a table during an annual library book sale, for only a dollar.  The John Kane painting on the cover, ""Panther Hollow, Pittsburgh,"" seemed quaint, reassuring, and spoke to me.  I immediately thought of Will and our long talks, and somehow all of a sudden, this memoir in particular struck me as something I would enjoy.Some of Dillard's childhood is eerily close to home for me.  Her open and universal sense of curiosity - for all kinds of books - those on rocks and minerals, history, science, and her childlike need to understand, classify, and organize.  Others aspects of her early life may very well have taken place on another planet, at least for me: she grew up in an upper middle-class neighborhood, attended a private school, often frequented country clubs with her parents, and, as she says ""grew up in a house full of comedians.""Dillard's writing brings out the full sense of what it may have felt like to grow up in the United States in the 1950s.  It's full of nostalgia, but not the mealy-mouthed, saccharine kind.  She loves the order of life, or at least she did when she was a child: her mother stayed at home while her eccentric father both brought home the bacon, but also planned, and actually set out on, a Mark Twain-inspired, jazz-infused journey from Pittsburgh all the way down to New Orleans.  (He soon returned, well before he reached his destination, from sheer loneliness.)  She was largely left to her own devices to read, look at diatoms and euglena through her beloved microscope, and attend school dances.  But Dillard also catches with touching beauty how crushingly small this all was, and how insular.  She didn't know this as a child, surely, but she knows as a writer looking back that this smallness, the smallness of 1950s America, can have whole worlds constructed out of it.  And that's precisely what she set out to build, both in her childhood and in this book.  The way she combines her wide open curiosity with what is in some respects its opposite, the feeling of suburban provincialism of Protestant Pittsburgh, is still one more thing that makes this writing special.I always found Dillard a good storyteller in ""An American Childhood,"" but sometimes she mixes in short, insightful, quasi-philosophical asides, like this one on page 157 on personality, after recalling her two friends Ellin and Judy and her little sister Molly: ""People's being themselves, year after year, so powerfully and so obliviously - what was it?  Why was it so appealing?  Personality, like beauty, was a mystery, like beauty, it was useless.  These useless things were not, however, flourishes and embellishments to our life here, but that life's center, they were its truest note, the heart of its form, which drew back our thoughts repeatedly.""In a few spots, Dillard mentions her interest in lepidoptery.  Just a few pages later, she paints one of the most memorable images in the entire book: that of a large butterfly on her schoolteacher's desk.  On the day it emerges from its chrysalis, she sees that the jar is too small for the butterfly - an especially large Polyphemus butterfly - to spread its wings.  The birth fluids dried in place, it couldn't spread its wings, and blood was not able to spread throughout the blood vessels.  Because of the size of its jar, it was left with permanently deformed, crumpled wings.  Her and her classmates released it outside, even though she knew that it would inevitable end up eaten by a bird or batted to death by a cat paw.  ""Nevertheless,"" Dillard writes, ""it was scrawling with what seemed wonderful vigor, as if, I thought at the time, it was still excited from being born.""There's something about this dual sense of both wonderment mixed with human weakness, frailty, and anxiety that wonderfully frames ""An American Childhood.""  Maybe one day soon, I will find ""Pilgrim at Tinker Creek.""  More likely, it will find me.  I will think of Will again, and our long conversations.  And so it goes, and so it goes.";1

520435;Clayton Christensen and colleagues point the way toward innovation in education by applying lessons learned through studying innovation in business.Christensen, author of The Innovator's Dilemma, calls for philanthropies and foundations to fund the kind of research that helps us learn how different people learn, how to identify those differences, and how different students can best educate themselves and each other.Future teachers will need skills to work one-on-one with different types of learners as they study in a student-centric way, Christensen says. Graduate schools of education must train researchers to go beyond doing descriptive research that seeks average tendencies. Instead, they should study the anomalies and outliers, where the richest insight often is found.Some major messages in this book:1. Few education reforms have addressed the root cause of students' inability to learn.2. Previous studies of innovation showed that direct attacks on existing systems do not lead to effective disruptive innovation. Instead, innovation must go around and underneath the system.3. We know that all children learn differently, but the way schooling is currently arranged discourages educating children in customized ways. We need a modular system.4. Emerging online user networks offer a model for circumventing the education system and creating a new, modular system that facilitates customization. Decentralized user networks democratize development and purchase decisions to the end users in the system--in this case students, parents, and teachers.Online courses offer the kind of customized, student-centric instruction that students most need, Christensen and colleagues argue. They propose that each school designate one person whose sole job is to implement online courses.;1
522406;This book introduces students to the world of Spanish pronouns and prepositions. Following the book's introduction which provides an overview of how the book should be used, there are two sections which go into great detail about the different types of Spanish pronouns and prepositions. Students will be exposed to 15 different topics on Spanish pronouns and prepositions. Some topics include subject pronouns, interrogative pronouns, prepositional pronouns, direct object pronouns, indirect object pronouns, double object pronoun constructions (indirect+direct), reflexive pronouns, para and por and verbs and adjectives with characteristic prepositions. Besides the main subjects of Spanish pronouns and prepositions, the book also presents appendices highlighting verb conjugations, answers to the exercises from both the Spanish pronoun and preposition sections and an English-Spanish vocabulary list.This book is designed for those who have some knowledge of the Spanish language, those who wish to broaden their insight into the workings of Spanish pronouns and prepositions, and those who are simply attempting to brighten their shine in the Spanish grammar arena. Whether you are an advanced learner or beginner, this book is a great tool for sharpening your Spanish language skills. While advanced learners have the edge of skipping through chapters due to their advanced level, it is recommended that beginners not skip any chapters as the book is designed in a sequential manner that builds on grammatical concepts and vocabulary that were discussed in previous chapters.If you've been searching for a book to assist you with honing your Spanish grammatical skills in the areas of pronouns and prepositions, you've just ended your search.Some other Amazon products that I recommend for Spanish language learners are listed below:A resource that highly recommend for adding new words to your Spanish vocabulary isQuick Study-Spanish Vocabulary Flash Cards-1000 cardsIt is a tremendous bargain for the price since you get 1,000 of these cards.For learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs, the best product is theVerbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)software.

To get the equivalent learning-Spanish value of this one book you would have to buy 3 or 4 books in the Practice Makes Perfect series.;1
595567;These seem to be Chicago days for this reviewer. He has just done some reviews of Chicago's Chess Records that essentially defined the sound of the electrified blues in what would be old Augie's old neighborhood. Furthermore, I have reviewed the work of Chicago's Nelson Algren who takes more than one look at the downside of Chicago life in the raw - what happens to the Augies when they do not break out of that place between the working poor and the lumpenproletariat. And this is a good place to set up the fundamental difference in Bellow's take on life as compared to Algrens's. Both describe lives and milieus that can expose the nasty, short and brutish side of life but unlike Algren's Frankie Machine in The Man With the Golden Arm Augie is smart (and clean enough) to make the break.To that extent Bellow's Augie, his pals and his town are a celebration of the possibilities that the immigrants to this country believed was possible (and on too many occasions were dashed to pieces). A nice little devise that Bellow uses to highlight this contrast is the tension between the career paths of Augie and his brother. Both face the existential crisis of being left to one's own devices in the world but the brother survives by creating wealth for himself and forgets, in fact scorns, the idea of intellectual reflections about man's fate. Poor Augie though wants to know the meaning of life once he has finally broken out of the working class milieu- but travel, a rich lady friend and a whole different set of adventures do not satisfy that hunger to know that meaning.I would argue, and here I go back to Augie's days as a Trotskyist, that he might have cut against the grain of that modern day sense of self-isolation in a heartless world if he had organized others to create an alternative society where that alienation from productive labor could have been diminished. But, that is just this reviewer pontificating against Bellow's facile early literary Trotskyism. Although I read this book initially about 25 years ago the first half still is gripping. The second half meanders a little more than I recall from the first reading.  This is an early work though. Bellow gets better as a writer later, if not in resolving the humankind's existential crisis.;1
613231;Since the first chapter, I have enjoyed every single one of young Heidi's adventures described on this treasured book.  Since the day I started reading it, I could not put it down, definitely a lovely book to read outside in the fresh air, so you can enjoy what makes it so beautiful, the feeling of freshness and beauty that it awakes in you.Little Heidi is a five-year-old girl who is sent to live with her grandfather, Uncle Alp, high, high in the European Alps after having been poorly taken care of by the careless Detie, sister to one of the girl's parents.  Uncle Alp at first seems to not want the girl's company and eagerly awaits the day in which she'll be sent away again,  but those feelings vanish for completely when he and Heidi begin spending more and more time together.  Heidi has managed to quickly make new friends, beginning from Peter, the naughty young shepherd and his family, Bridget, his mother and Grannie, his old, blind grandmother.  Each of them spend wonderful days in the mountains with Heidi's pleasant company.  However, things in that part of the alps look dark the day Detie does return to take Heidi away to a family far away in a town named Frankfurt.  Heidi is taken to the family of a lonely 12-year-old girl named Clara Sasemann, an invalid who longs for company as her own life is boring and unexciting.  Heidi longs to go back to the alps and is promised to be able to go back, but staying there for a few weeks, Heidi befriends the kind girl Clara as long as some of the house servants and serves as a good challenge for the strict Miss Rottenmeier.  Heidi's return to the mountains brings happiness to everyone but more happiness is to come when she receives the visits of her old friends.This book, written by Johanna Spyri is a true masterpiece and can be enjoyed by both children and adults alike.  It offers lots of fun-filled episodes as well as very lovable characters.  What I found more thrilling was Mrs. Spyri's simple writing style which really helped me understand the story without feeling lost or with the need to re-read.  The story is told beautifully and it lets you feel the viewpoints of each of the characters.  I would recommend this book to anyone, young and old.;1

581192;"Jack ""Legs"" Diamond, a larger than life thief/bootlegger/murderer, captured the imagination of the public during Prohibition, the Roaring Twenties, and the beginning of the Great Depression.  Living the high life, surrounded by beautiful women, bodyguards, and associates, Diamond, in his early thirties, moved smoothly between speakeasies and sordid backrooms, between murder scenes and rural retreats, always exuding a sense of confidence and glamour.  Setting this novel primarily in Albany, New York, in 1930-1931, Kennedy recreates the mystique of Diamond, a much handsomer contemporary of Chicago gangster Al Capone, and New York beer king Dutch Schultz, as he exercises his power, fights off intrusions into ""his"" territory, corners the market in illegal beverages, buys off politicians and judges, and tries to avoid conviction for his crimes.Telling Diamond's story is Marcus Gorman, a lawyer who gets swept up in the excitement which surrounds Diamond and ends up as his attorney.  Marcus, however, always insists that he be paid for his work, up front, and he refuses to be drawn into obviously illegal behavior.  This makes him the perfect narrator-someone who admires much about Diamond but also someone whose judgment the reader can trust.  Terse dialogue reminiscent of the novels of Raymond Chandler or Dashiel Hammett, fills the novel, but Marcus's musings about what motivates Diamond offer a more thoughtful approach to this shady character and his life than what one usually finds in noir novels.A man with no conscience, Diamond double-crosses and cheats his way to success, often killing his own associates, events described in gory detail.  But Diamond's legend grows.  Kennedy humanizes him by emphasizing the loyalty of his wife Alice and the crazy love of his girlfriend, showgirl Kiki Roberts.  After his two major trials, even the jury celebrates the inevitable acquittals.  Other mobsters fear him, however, and know that if they don't get him first that he will get them.  Surviving three murder attempts in two years, Diamond absorbs eleven bullets, before his final gun battle.An uncomplicated but well-written novel, _Legs_ illustrates the attraction many feel to celebrity, even a sadistic celebrity such as Diamond.  The author's insights into his life and motivations help to explain the roots of this attraction, and his follow-up on the lives of both Alice Diamond and Kiki Roberts brings the themes full circle.  Fun to read, this is the first of the novels in the ""Albany Cycle,"" followed by _Billy Phelan's Greatest Game_ and the Pulitzer Prize-winning _Ironweed_. n Mary Whipple";1

47453;THE FOUNTAINHEAD came highly recommended by a like-thinking libertarian friend of mine who believed I would be receptive to Ayn Rand's philosophical ideals of personal freedom and free market ideals.  Upon  reading Rand's epic, I was struck by its similarities to John Milton's  PARADISE LOST.  Like Milton, Rand has curiously allowed the novel's  supposed villain, Ellsworth Toohey, to be the most fascinating character in  the book.Unlike Milton's epic poem, however, Rand's novel has virtually  no literary value whatsoever.  The novel's value arises merely from the  odious fact that her cult of devotees insist this trash is a classic of  world literature and philosophy. As a philosopher, Ayn Rand is no novelist.  And as a novelist, Ayn Rand is no philosopher.There is absolutely no  believable dialogue or action in this novel -- the weak plot functions  merely as a tool for philosophical harangues to spill out of the mouths of  completely uninteresting characters.  I know the defenders of THE  FOUNTAINHEAD say that Rand purposefully created an ideal character in  Howard Roark.  Ideal?  Perhaps.  Unsurpassingly dull, without a doubt.  Howard Roark is the most wooden, one dimensional literary character that I  have ever encountered,  he exists solely on the paper on which he is  printed.The love scenes between Howard Roark and Dominique Francon are  likewise laughable. Rand's idea of passion must be akin to a neanderthal  clubbing his betrothed over the head and dragging her back to the cave. How  ironic that Rand completely subverts her Objectivist philosophy by  pandering to the lowest common denominator.Defenders of Rand say that  THE FOUNTAINHEAD is actually the lessor of Rand's philosophical treatises,  and that to fully appreciate Objectivism, you must read ATLAS SHRUGGED.  Well, thanks but no thanks.  After suffering through some 700 pages of THE  FOUNTAINHEAD, I've served my time in hell.Jean Paul Sartre had it all  wrong, hell isn't other people, its suffering through utterly boring books  such as THE FOUNTAINHEAD.

292201;I was totally enthralled with the last two books in this trilogy, and couldn't wait to get my hands on this last one...but it actually just left me hanging.  Kelly Armstrong finished with tons of action as Chloe and the gang take on the Edison group, and it was written in the same strong grip-your-seat-to-stop-bouncing dialogue.  The characters all rallied together, Tori included, which it was a nice pace to have a happier/more down to earth Tori instead of one that you wished was written out of the book, and the love interest was played out nicely.  Derek and Chloe had their moments, which personally I wish was played out a bit more instead of all the interruptions from other character.  However, the end of the book left me checking to see if I missed a page or another book is supposed to come out.  Simon and Tori never found out they were related, plus you have all the unanswered questions like what happens to the Edison group after, especially the two who were on the inside? What about the big boss demon who spies Chloe and likes her ramped up powers?  Or the demi-demon she set free?  Will they always be on the run?  The list goes on and on.  And I might be the only silly one who thinks this but in the last book Derek said that once saliva gets into the bloodstream it will turn you, so I kept waiting for him to say something about them not being together because he could turn her.  The beginning of the book and the middle were great, and even the ending was okay, but it still just left  me wishing for more...and slightly disappointed that I waited so long for that kind of ending.;1
622311;Mr. Charles Pooter, a middle-class, middle-aged suburban Londoner in the late Victorian Era, decides to keep a diary.  After all, it seems like everyone is publishing their diaries, so why shouldn't he?  His only regret is that he had not begun the diary sooner.  When part of the way through this hilarious story related through his daily entries it seems that someone ripped out several pages to use for fire kindling, he says to his loyal wife and impudent son that he had hoped the diary would be a fond remembrance of him after he died and possibly that having it published could bring them some remuneration.  His loved ones cannot suppress their laughter.The biggest joke is that in fact, this diary of a dedicated clerk in an old-fashioned accounting firm, who has done little else in his life and is quite comfortable with the status quo, is eternally priceless on for its comedy and what it reveals about the Victorian middle-class life and preoccupations that it satirizes.  If Mr. Pooter and his friends represent a culture that has grown complacent and overly interested in its own hobby horses and etiquette,  his adult son Lupin is the brash younger generation that seeks entertainment and gratification without apology, shaking off musty traditions.  The Grossmith brothers--George largely wrote this and Weedon illustrated it as a magazine serial--had no idea that they were creating a historical document as much as a giddy entertainment.The comedy is absolutely winning.  The Grossmiths don't sell Mr. Pooter down the river entirely--they allow him competence at work, some self awareness and wounded dignity--but every diary entry usually sets up his hopes and schemes only to be reported as dashed in the next.  Long before Rodney Dangerfield complained that he didn't get respect, Mr. Pooter had every right to cry that out as younger clerks, the neighbors, his son, his son's friends and the servants feel free to regularly contradict and insult him.  There is plenty of physical comedy and fashion gone bad.  And there is that voice of Mr. Pooter, at once plaintive, hopeful, clueless, sweet but not stupid, who always picks himself up after a fall.;1

I did. However I'm not as sure of them as I perhaps should be. You see Jeff explains why `everything should be searchable and linkable', why `you can't beat free', why `atoms are the old method, internet is the new'. So why is Jeff publishing this as a book, not a free, advert supported eBook or a website? Money, that's why. He says it himself in the book. So if you can't practice what you preach (and it's very preachy), why should I believe your other advice Jeff? Is your book not available free online because that method doesn't work? Because it isn't viable?Jeff talks about web content and how the mass of niches will beat the old system - being able to find what you want rather than being told. Which is accurate, but he largely ignores the argument of quality over quantity, that the mass of niches will only work if great content is produced and wins out. For the most part he ignores that the reason Google succeeds is because they make great quality products for free. How many people can afford to do that? Not Jeff, he's got my money.Lastly, he talks about the power of the masses, the bloggers, how customer services (CS) is everything. How a company should spend it's money on CS, not advertising, let your fans be your adverts. Fine point. But if that happened, Google, who's revenue stream is advertising, would die a horrible death.There is much to like about this book. It really does give a good snapshot of how marketing and the internet is changing and should be read by every CEO to understand the power great products and good customer service. Just don't expect it to change your business models, yet.;1
648042;Nella Larsen's novella is a subtle but devastatingly powerful work.  It takes a satirical view of the pretensions of Black bourgeois society in Harlem in the 1920's but also skewers White social pretensions, racism, and hypocrisy as well.  At the same time it is also a deep explorations of the phenomenon of passing, light skinned Blacks passing as Whites, either for temporary convenience like Irene going to an exclusive White restaurant or Clare living a permanent lie with a racist White husband.  One learns the psychological effects and dilemmas that must be faced either subtlely or blatantly, honestly or dishonestly, or some shade of gray in between. The desire  and ability to get past the racial checkpoints and not be judged on the color of the skin gets underneath the skin and takes its toll in other ways.  And the same desire for passing can be seen in the understandable parental desire, as in the case of Irene, to shelter her children from early awareness of lynching and other violent manifestations of racism.  Her husband Brian wants to prepare them for that nightmarish world but Irene would prefer they pass through childhood in a normal, happy fashion.Larsen writes of society in a sophisticated manner that might remind one of Henry James or E.M. Forster but with the added dimension of racism that is always present whether on the surface or below it.Another excellent book that explores passing and the tragedy of racism that propels it is The Sweeter the Juice by Shirlee Taylor Hazlip. The Devil in the Blue Dress is  a novel I have not read it but I have seen and would recommend the movie.;1
201369;Blind Man's Bluff offers us a series of ten or so submarine spy tales, which being true are all the more exciting.We read of the first diesel submarines that could stay hidden under water for only short periods because they needed to surface to replenish their air supply. These were soon replaced by nuclear submarines that didn't need air to produce the energy to run their engines and recycle the crew's air. We read of a lost Soviet submarine lost at sea, found by Naval Intelligence through clever reasoning, but then lost by the CIA when they took the project over attempted an overambitious and unnecessary salvage of the whole boat.Most fascinating of all is the story of the recording taps American subs placed on Soviet undersea cables, enabling the Americans to listen to thousands of hours of Soviet military conversations. An intelligence treasure trove unfortunately rendered useless by a spy who alerted the Soviets to one of the tapping operations.The stories are a little disjointed from one another and so fail to form a completely coherent narrative. On the other hand, they are presented in chronological order, starting with submarine operations under the Eisenhower administration and ending under Clinton, so we get a good sense of how these operations have evolved. Recommended.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo;1
644070;A stranger on a plane I was on was reading this book on her Kindle.  We were both flying home to Jackson. She and I started a conversation as I was also reading on my Kindle.  She kept saying how great her book was!!  She told me I just had to get this book.  So I checked into it and downloaded it.  I'm just like her - I can't put it down!!  I am 1/2 way thru with it.  I pick it up constantly.  I got up a couple of times last night because I just had to read a little further.  It is so suspenseful and compelling.  Its one of the very best books I have read in years (and I read a lot!).  I wish I could find that stranger and thank her.;1
596818;This is the seminal work on the poor in America, analyzed within the context of government proffered, anti-poverty programs. It is a scathing critique and analysis of the war on poverty, where bold rhetoric and political grandstanding have often supplanted action. The author in his analysis categorizes poverty as a cultural and often institutional way of life that would require radical innovations, social planning, and long term financial investment, were the government really serious about eradicating poverty in America. What is amazing is that the arguments made by the author, when he wrote this book forty years ago, are still sound today.;1
17016;It was a selection for our book club and I have tried three times to read it. I can't get past all the details and therefore I can't want to read it. I am not a horseperson. I wouldn't have bought it if I wasn't required to do so.;1

643030;I hated to see this book come to an end!  You could almost feel the heat and humidity of the deep South, as well as the simmering heat of that era's racial tensions.  The characters evoke such a wide range of emotions:  pride, anger, admiration, pity, fear.  The story was powerful - without preaching.  I won't forget this book.;1
353099;Neal Stephenson is an extremely intelligent writer.  Having read his science fiction novel, Anathem, I was anxious to read more of his work, hence my experience with this novel, which was provided to me free of charge as part of the Early Reviewer program in Library Thing.Unlike most of Stephenson's earlier work, this is not science fiction as much as science fact.  The plot of the story revolves around a role playing computer game named T'rain (think World of Warcraft) and a computer virus which integrates and intertwines the two worlds (real and imaginary).  Characters include the rebellious, middle aged creator of T'rain, his adopted niece, Chinese computer hackers, Russian mafia and Islamic terrorists, you get the picture.Like most of Stephenson's work, this is a magnum opus of over 1,000 pages.  I can't help but feel, having slogged through the book, that this could have been a much better 750 page effort.  As it is, however, it is at times very good, at others, simply boring, with descriptive prose that is virtually impossible to follow, and finally just silly.MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOWThe final 200 or so pages have all the major characters in the novel improbably converge on the same area of wilderness along the Idaho/Canadian border.  What then takes place borders on the absurd.  How else can you describe the heroine's escape by virtue of a mountain lion attack just as a terrorist levels his shotgun at close range?  Several such ridiculous plot twists left me thinking I was watching an episode of McGyver as opposed to reading a Neal Stephenson novel.  How many people do you know that can fashion a 20 foot collapsible ladder from the bungee cords on a backpack and sticks found in the woods?  Zula can!Stephenson has made quite a name for himself in the realm of intelligent science fiction.  In my opinion, he should stick to that genre.  There, he can exercise his apparent liking for the fantastic without crossing the borders of the ridiculous.;1
382765;A fasted paced plot that is enjoyable, but at times predictable. There were some very good twists, and some that felt like they were supposed to be BIG TWISTS that were easy to see coming.There were a couple of things the author threw in that just felt... odd. Pushing a personal agenda that didn't have anything to do with the story or world.I really liked the author's use of Chicago (her hometown) and talking about some of the landmarks. It was a nice touch. The wrap up was a little quick, but it is going to part of a trilogy.;1
42615;The Iron King by Maurice Druon caught my eye due to the George R.R. Martin blurb on the front cover. I love the political machinations and scandal within the plot of Game Of Thrones. Seeing Martin proclaim The Iron King to be the original Game Of Thrones definitely had my attention, as I am interested in reading more books with well-developed characters and interesting politics. While The Iron King might not be fantasy, nor does it have dragons, it was an okay historical fiction book set across medieval France and England featuring the intrigue of royals and several interweaving plot lines.Druon's The Iron King opens with a description of how King Philip The Fair has basically destroyed the Knights Templar over the course of seven years because the Templars were the only people who dared to stand up to him while he was amassing wealth and power for France. The story then shifts to Isabella, Queen of England. Isabella is in a loveless marriage, as her husband, King Richard is into men. This does not mean that Isabella is meek, though. Instead, she is scheming with a French noble, Robert of Artois to catch her sisters-in-law in the act of adultery. Interwoven is the story of Jacques de Molay's execution and the curse he places upon King Philip, the Pope and the rector of the French kingdom, in which Molay says they will all die within a year. In addition, there's a subplot involving a moneylender or a Lombard named Guccio Baglioni who is sent to England to collect on a debt. Essentially, these different elements weave together and we see King Philip The Fair's down fall and untimely end.One of the reasons that I did not love The Iron King is that I felt as though I was held at arm's length from the characters. I never really found myself caring about the characters and their machinations. To me, I felt as though this was more of a plot driven book rather than character driven. I thought that King Phillip seemed rather one note, always so strong without a hint of regret for what he did to the Templars. It was hard to really care about Isabella because she came off as an ice princess and we never really got to dig deeply into her character. Baglioni gets plenty of scenes, but he came across as very self-serving and awful. Granted, he is only 18 so has a lot of growing up to do in comparison to the other, older characters. I think this may have been my biggest problem, how there wasn't really a good guy sort of character to latch onto and root for, and in the absence I did not feel as though the other characters were well-developed enough to feel fully real and fully human to me. I guess if I am to make inevitable Martin comparisons, I would say that Martin draws his characters very, very well with strengths and flaws, whereas Druon's characters just seemed so flat to me.There are some decent action scenes within this book, which help to keep it interesting and the plot moving. Druon does a decent job building suspense between events and characters. This especially works well as de Molay's curse is carried out and different characters are introduced for a few pages. These characters hint at playing a larger role later in the series. If not for the plotting and the pacing, I would probably have set this book aside and just not finished it. Yet, the storyline kept me engaged.Druon's writing style feels a bit cut and dry. It left something to be desired on my end. Maybe this is a result of the translation, but I doubt it. I guess I just really found The Iron King to be lacking. To me, the whole book reads like one giant set up and exposition for the rest of the series. As this is the opening book to his Accursed Kings series, I suppose that makes sense, but ultimately I was left unsatisfied. Personally, as a reader I don't feel any sense of investment in this series and likely will not be continuing. Yet, I think that if you are really into historical fiction, the 100 Years War, and the political machinations of nobility, you might really enjoy Druon's The Iron King.;1
258204;I love this author.  Sometimes the predicaments her characters confront sound so much like mine that I think Ms. Davidson is spying on me.  I love the recipes in all of the Goldy books.  I usually try to pace myself, but I generally end up reading the Goldy books in two days because I can't seem to put the books down for very long.;1
225549;I had read another book by this same author that I thought was really well done.  This one was a disappointment.  It did not have much of a plot, just a group of barely connected characters with a rather silly premise.  There were parts that were amusing, but as a whole, there are better things to read than this book.;1

140187;"There are a lot of books out there on the subject of the the atomic bombing of Japan, more of them about Hiroshima than Nagasaki. Stephen Walker's ""Shockwave: Countdown to Hiroshima"" focuses on the former. In a clear and fast-paced style of a film director, Walker focuses first on the development of the bomb through the Manhattan Project. Once the bomb is developed, he turns to the 509th Composite Group and the crew that would deliver the bomb. Walker also manages to weave in little about the Japanese government's attempt to secure a negotiated peace, a personal story of two Japanese forever separated by the blast, and the experiences of other Japanese civilians and military personnel who survived the bomb. Fact-filled yet easy to read, and unburdened by scholarly footnotes, ""Shockwave"" is a terrific introductory read for anyone interested in this fascinating yet tragic period of history.";1
349353;Until I reread it, this year, I had forgotten how funny and perceptive this play was. I love the characters that are peripheral to the story. Modern culture undersells this story by portraying it as a love story only. It has so much more to it than that. Not only is Romeo and Juliet a love story, it has that other quality - it is really funny, and Shakespeare cleverly uses other characters in the story to highlight some of the plot absurdities.  We are asked to suspend disbelief about the time line - three days - because that suits the dramatic format.  But it is a play that is very aware of itself.I love it when Friar Laurence listens to  Romeo wax lyrical about Juliet, when only yesterday it had been Rosaline...'Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,So soon forsaken?  Young men's love then liesNot truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.'I can just hear the Friar huffing ironically at young love.  Fantastic.What about Juliet, who shows a real bit of wit, when she is talking to her nurse, as well as the Nurse - one of my favourite characters.Juliet is impatient for the Nurse to tell her what Romeo has said, while Nurse is recovering from her journey:Juliet:I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:Nay, come, I pray thee, speak, good nurse, speak.Nurse:Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?Do you not see that I am out of breath?(and Juliet impatiently answers)How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breathto say that thou art out of breath.The excuse that thou dost make in this delayIs longer than the tale dost excuse.And of course, there are some of the most famous Shakespearean scenes and lines....Romeo upon seeing Juliet at the window:But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.and there is so much more.  Romeo and Juliet was written to entertain, hold its audience in knowing suspense, to frustrate and amuse.  And, young love being well known to be intense and dramatic, means that the audience can be both knowing and sympathetic, and enhances the tragedy of the deaths.;1
533078;Crichton book, sci-fiction? Hmm well i gave it a try.. This book tells the story of time travelling. How? Ofcourse with a time machine. I never believed in time travelling but as always Crichton trows a lot of &quot,real&quot, information at you. You almost get the feeling that time travelling is possible. The story in this book is good but sometimes a little slow. No doubt the  best part of the book is when a team goes back in time to save a dude stucked in time against evil knights.If you really like an adventure book read crichton's lost world it's better.;1
306871;"To be completely honest, I feel the cover of the book is lacking.  There is such an intense story in the pages of this book.  I believe the cover could have been much better and even incorporated some fantastic story elements.  I understand I may be showing a glimmer of my shallow side when I say this, but I probably wouldn't have read this book without winning it.  I know, I know... and I don't judge a book by it's cover alone, but it IS the first thing that grabs my attention, and Delirium's cover just doesn't do that for me.The first half of the book seemed very slow to me.  To be fair,  this is the first dystopian novel I have read, which I'm sure attributed to the ""slow"" feeling that I had.  I also understand there is a ton of information necessary when building a dystopian world.  The first 200 pages or so contained everything that we need to know in order to understand who Lena is and what her world is all about, so although I felt it was slow, I also agree that it was necessary.Once I reached the middle of the book, the pace picked up and Delirium became much more interesting for me.  Lena starts taking risks and dealing with inner struggles.  Alex is introduced and things start happening.  After the half-way point, I honestly didn't want to put the book down.  I loved that the novel is written in first person, also.  That point of view puts the reader directly into Lena's head and allows us to really feel what's going on.  The further I got into the book, the more drawn in I was.  Once I hit that half way point, there was no stopping.  I had to finish, and when I did.... oy.When I first announced on Twitter that I had won the ARC of Delirium, I was warned by friends to have the kleenex ready.  They were so right.  Ms. Oliver, I understand why.  I do.  Your ending made one amazing story!  BUT... the romantic in me still has to ask WHY???  There had to be another way! lolAll things considered, Delirium is a phenomenal read and I highly recommend it for anyone!";1

294601;"I absolutely loved this story! Kiera is the ideal heroine. In less skillful hands, a Genetically Engineered Person like Kiera might have come across as too ""perfect,"" but Ms. Allred allows the reader to identify with Kiera's flaws and fears, making her more ""Natural"" than a lot of romance heroines in traditional stories.Thor is sexy and sublime. Considering there's a tremendous language barrier between the two for the first half of the book, I'm awed that Ms. Allred communicated so much heat with her prose.Kudos to Close Encounters and you can bet I'll be pre-ordering the next book in the Alien Affairs series!";1

346350;Derek the Ghost has decided to record the many events and stories of his classmates at Scary School.  Derek accidentally died last year in a school fire, but kids who die at Scary School are rarely ever dead.  Most return as vampires, zombies, ghosts and other fantastic creatures.  Scary School is certainly not your ordinary school.  It is a place where monsters and humans go to learn.  Always expect the unexpected at this wild and wacky school.  Most of all be extra careful, wouldn't want you to get eaten by a dragon, or T Rex or giant Squid!What I Liked:*I was a little surprised that Scary School is not a standard story line, plot driven book.  Instead it is set up in multiple short story chapters.  Each chapter introduces a student and tells of an adventure or experience at Scary School.  Most of the students end up learning a valuable lesson by the end of their chapter.  I liked that this book is a collection of stories that come together in a loose story line that basically takes the young reader through the months as they follow each character's chapter.  At the end of the book, all the stories culminate into the Ghoul Games.  An event where the students at Scary School must compete against all the other monsters, and if the monsters win they will eat the students.  Fear not.... for those of you worried about a dramatic outcome for young readers... all ends up well in the end.*I loved all the little life lessons at morales that I learned from each of the student's and their experiences. There are many great ideas for young minds.*I ended up liking that each story could stand alone as a short story.  Perfect for younger readers who are inclined to read a bit each day.  This would be a good book to read aloud to children at school or at bedtime each night.  Since it is broken up into short story chapters.*I liked meeting all the unique students, staff and monsters of Scary School as well as exploring the grounds of this interesting school.  This book is great for young kids with imaginations! One of my favorite kids was a boy who was never afraid because he believed he was dreaming all the time!*I absolutely loved the illustrations in this one!  They are fantastic and they go perfectly with the stories!*I liked that the Scary School Website has games and quizzes and many other fun features that tie into the books. Be sure to check out the website, it will enrich your reading experience.And The Not So Much:*At first, I was a little alarmed that students were eaten and killed all the time at Scary School, but I was delighted to find that no one is really dead at Scary School.  Everyone usually ends up coming back to life in one way or another.*I wished that Derek the Ghost, the narrator of the book, was better developed.  There is just a tiny snippet on him at the beginning and a couple of more paragraphs sprinkled throughout the book, but I wanted a complete chapter on Derek so I could know what kind of boy he was before he died and learn a few more details about him.*If you are not a fan of paranormal creatures or discussions on death, dying, dragons eating students and people crushing heads, this may not be a good choice for you.  The violence is more like cartoon violence, but I know some parents do not like to have any violence in their children's books.  Everything in this book is in good fun, but a keep in mind there are discussions on the above topics in this book.I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.;1
387328;Matthew Dunn, the author, was an active M16 agent for many years, so the story has the benefit of his experience. The human element or development of characters is strained, however. People are pawns of deception to be murdered it seems.  The changes of pace became tiresome reading after a while. Will Cochrane , the main character seems to have sacrificed his personhood to his work which is always risky or violent. I found myself wanting to like this book but just couldn't get around the frenetic pace which seemed unrelated to the plot. I am sure there are many who may find this book exciting.;1

Cars are left running, stoves are still on, and young babies are left alone.  Could it have something to do with the nuclear power station in town? Nobody can figure out what is happening as panic starts to set in. Most of the kids begin to wander Perdido Beach, looking for someone to take charge, Sam is an obvious choice (he once saved a bus full of kids) but he doesn't want to take the lead. He is afraid his strange ""powers"" may have started all of this and he doesn't want anyone to find out. His friend, Astrid, is aware that her autistic brother, Little Pete, also has special powers, but she is reluctant to let anyone know.  But when the students from Coates Academy, the school on the outskirts of town for ""troubled"" kids, including Caine, their ringleader, come down to the town they set themselves up as the new rulers of the FAYZ, as they now call Perdido Beach.As Sam, Astrid, Little Pete, Quinn, and Edilio work together to survive they discover things are even weirder than they first thought- they discover they are living within a ten-mile radius around the nuclear power plant that is bounded by a barrier they cannot see any end to, see through, or even touch without harming themselves.  And that's not strangest thing in the FAYZ.  There are talking coyotes, seagulls with talons, and flying snakes.  Not to mention the strange ""powers"" that more and more kids seem to be developing.I couldn't put this one down.  Thank goodness there is a sequel coming out this summer!

321236;In 1917, British nurse Bess Crawford escorts several severely injured soldiers from the trenches of France back to England.  One of her patients, severely burned pilot Lieutenant Meriwether Evanson is unrecognizable as he barely clings to his life, his seemingly only reason to live is the photo of his beloved wife pinned to his garb.  Thus she is taken aback at the London train station to see that woman from the picture crying on the shoulder of a man who is not Meriwether.After another deployment in France, Bess is shocked to read in the paper that someone murdered Meriwether's wife by brutally stabbing Marjorie.  Already despondent and in excruciating pain, Evanson learns of his beloved spouse's murder and commits suicide.  Bess feels a tie to the late pilot so she makes inquiries into whom that officer Marjorie was with when she was weeping at the station and whether that person is her killer.Readers will be fascinated with the second Bess Crawford WWI amateur sleuth tale (see A Duty to the Dead) that deals with the impact of the war in the trenches of France and on the home front.  The mystery is fun to follow but Bess' motives for her investigation seems weak at best and what she does as a nurse makes it seem impossible to add a murder inquiry onto her already traumatic job.  1917 life in France and England makes for a vivid and engaging historical mystery.Harriet Klausner;1
3101;This is my first exposure to Ernest Hemingway and, after reading it, I wonder how I could go through eight years of high school and college and not read one Hemingway book.  I loved this book!  I have never taken so quickly to a piece of classic literature.  Hemingway's style is powerful, evocative, and dramatic.  And yet none of the prose is overly verbose or bombastic.  This tale, set over four days in the mountains of Spain during the Spanish Civil War, follows Robert Jordan, an American fighting in the International Brigade, and his preparations for a bridge demolition.  During that time, he falls in love with the beautiful and tragic Maria as well as befriends the group of guerrillas he is working with.  During those four days, Jordan loves, idealizes, and submits to his dutiful fate more passionately than most men ever will.  If you have never read Hemingway before, I suggest you do so right away.  This book is a great one to start with and I know that I will be looking to read more of his works soon.;1

308506;THE CARRIE DIARIES follows Carrie Bradshaw pre-Sex and the City.Seventeen-year-old Carrie is just beginning her senior year in high school, and like all girls she falls for the gorgeous bad boy, Sebastian Kydd.  Before long, Carrie and Sebastian are a couple - and the envy of the popular girls, who harass Carrie and make her life harder than it needs to be.Besides Carrie's hot-and-cold relationship with Sebastian, she also has to deal with a huge secret her best friend, Walt, is keeping, and a betrayal that threatens to ruin a lifelong friendship in an instant.Fans of Sex and the City will enjoy this novel, as it gives a lot of information on Carrie's family life and what inspired her to become a writer. It also recounts how it is that Carrie arrived in New York all those years ago, which ties it in nicely with both Candace Bushnell's adult novels and the show.Reviewed by:  Angela S.;1

Now, I love the parallel narrator but I don't think it was executed properly.I hate the fact that Tris died, I saw no point to it whatsoever!! I get the sacrifice, but to be killed by bullets after surviving the serum, that's just ridiculous and pointless. She could have (and should have) fired before he did. She had done it before, she was skilled and smart, though her plan doesn't suggest it, but the rest of well executed story before this book does.I also hate how Tobias changes from this perfect strong man into a girl, literally he lost his entire identity and becomes annoying to read! I loved him strong and smart, but then it didn't make sense!!! He got lost somewhere for no reason, just like the characters were dropping dead for no good reaso... I also think he should have gone through his fear landscape one last time, as a close. He overcame all his fears! (Zip lining at the end counts!) It would have been fantastic for him to live through as a sign of acceptance and moving on.I thought at first the story was going to make sense, and for a whole it did, although it fell flat at some point. It was obvious that it was a social experiment, why ever they thought it would work is beyond me. As for why it happened in the first place: that premise is the most stupid thing I've ever read! Genetic modification doesn't work like that! &#34,Damaged&#34, genes will only get worse after mixing them with other damaged genes, not better. Also what is this about genetically pure people being perfect?!? I mean what?!? Did they just randomly choose to forget world history before their time of convenience or where their memories erased?? (This would actually make more sense!) I mean come on! Tris is anything but perfect and that's what was great about her.. All characters are flawed!In the end, her death was pointless. I hate that they brander her a rebel kid and that her death has no meaning and how it was all for nothing... I want to say I cried, but I was outraged at how her death came and the pointlessness of it, I was pissed, and by the end, it just felt empty... Btw: before I read or decided to read the series I already knew she died, but I wanted to see how, and was sorely disappointed. I don't mind that she died, just how and why...The final chapters that take you through Tobias's mourning, and the scattering of her ashes also felt forced, somehow. this entire flash back is just ridiculous cause it doesn't make sense! Like a situation like that would ever happen just because one of the compounds was brain washed, yeah right!I was frustrated and left feeling empty as soon as I finishes. I wish the author swould re-write this into another coherent story ending.. Tris can still die, Tobias can too, but for the right reasons and with purpose and meaning...;1

He could not stop talking about how good it was, so I read it.  He was right!  We are now huge fans and I have ordered every one of his books for our Kindles.His characters and descriptions are enthralling.  Sometimes they make me wince and other times, I laugh.  Every book has a great story line and a terrific ending.  It makes it all the better that the lawyer (main character in the books) is a self described 'weakling' and pretty much a coward in physical situations.Actually, he seems like a very stand up guy to me and he does things no other 'physically fit' lawyer would ever do in order to help his clients.Read all of Lashner's books.

529784;"Christos Tsiolkas' first novel is an explosive and unabashed exploration of the tension between individuality and cultural expectation.  As a young Greek man, living in Melbourne, Australia, Ari struggles to reconcile his own sexuality with the traditional expectations of his family: all without success.  However, there is more depicted in this short novel than simply a young man dealing with his sexuality.In setting the tale as one Ari's nights out, the reader is taken on a journey through the subcultural experiences of disillusioned youth.  Dancing, drugs, music, homophobia, violence, and anonymous sex: we watch fascinated, as Ari winds these tendrils of destruction willingly about himself.  In seeking his own destruction because he cannot imagine anything better, Ari becomes a heroic character, trapped by the expectations others have of him.This short novel is no stroll through a country garden, with a nice happy ending to complete it.  Ari's experience is more akin to someone dropping napalm throughout their own life, then sitting back and simply watching the consequences.  A quick but rewarding read, ""Loaded"" is a voice for thousands of young gay men throughout the world who feel trapped by culture and expectation, and see no way out except through self-destruction.The movie ""Head On,"" released in 1998 and starring Alex Dimitriades, is a faithful adaptation of Tsiolkas' novel.  Both explore the same themes and ideas, despite a number of (expected) differences.  Dimitriades' portrayal of Ari is similarly accurate and authentic.  Both film and novel stand on their own right as wonderful texts.  Both worthwhile.";1

331528;"The Reluctant Vampire, Argeneau number fifteen(!), was my favorite of Sands' light vampire romances in a long time.  The matchmaking continues, as rogue hunting Drina gets a chance to check out vampire Harper - who is still guilt ridden over losing his lifemate during her 'Turn' - while they are both pulling 'babysitting' duty for fangless teen vamp Stephanie - who is still in danger from her insane maker.The last few ""Hunter"" books in particular have started to feel very formulaic to me, so it really helped that this time around we get a vamp/vamp pairing instead of a human/vamp one. Which meant, no need to hide the fangs from the mate-to-be or to explain the 'nanos' in gory detail - we still get coma inducing sex, but I can live with that:)What won me over initially though, is I that found Stephanie's not so subtle method of getting hero Harper in the right frame of mind to accept a lifemate dispite his guilt to be pretty funny.  It was also fun to see some of the characters from previous books, but one has to wonder what Lucien was thinking putting all of those new- and easily 'distracted' - lifemates on guard duty.Since the story is set in Accidental Vampires Elvies' home town, the character I was the happiest to see was Port Henry's police chief Teddy - and I was also happy to see that Teddy may have some fang in his future as well, since he is the star of Sands' offering in the anthology Bite Before Christmas (with Jeaniene Frost).The Bite Before Christmas";1
594674;"As I was reading The Winter of Our Discontent there was something about Ethan Hawley's character that reminded me of Willy Loman, Arthur Miller's tragic hero in his play Death of a Salesman. In Miller's work, Loman is a salesman who has lost touch with reality, and always is after what success is about, as he imagines talking to his dead brother Ben to try to get the answers to life. A man who was probably most successful in his daydreams than real life, Willy Loman might be considered an underachiever or loser by some, but there is a certain sympathy we carry for him. I bring up this character because Ethan, in The Winter of Our Discontent, has some of these same qualities, although he is not established like Loman (even in his own musings or dreams), and more glaringly, he is not as likeable or forgivable. Ethan also strives to gain a piece of the American dream, as he comes from strong family roots in New England, and works as a clerk in the town's local grocery store. Feeling the pressure from his wife and two kids, he wants to move upward in the world and be able to provide the wealth and comforts that make a father a success. He wants to carry on the family legacy with pride, and attain the status that makes him a success in his own mind. In this way, Ethan Hawley is a man with ambition, however, Macbeth was ambitious too. The crisis of conflict that Hawley ultimately experiences is that he gives in to moral standards to become ""someone"" in the world, which means setting aside morals, friends, and conscientiousness in hopes of attaining this status. Much like a Shakespeare tragic hero, or Willy Loman, he continues onward, attributing all things to fate, but ultimately has to come face to face with himself.Hawley makes several key decisions that ultimately affect those close to him negatively. He loans money to his childhood friend Danny, a town drunk, to supposedly help him get some help with his drinking, but knowing full-well that he will drink himself to death with the money. He also gets him to use his own property as collateral if he shouldn't pay it back. His boss, who once gives him the advise to ""look after number one,"" is deported after Ethan reports him to authorities, once this take place, the store becomes Ethan's, and he is no longer ""just a clerk"", but owner. Hawley also has plans of robbing a store in his mind, and is only stopped just short of doing this. One ironic aspect is when Ethan's son, Allen, plagiarizes on his ""I Love America"" essay and is scolded, just as Ethan has cheated the system to get ahead, his son has followed in his footsteps, yet only his son gets reprimanded for it. Ethan seems to legitimize his own actions: ""Strength and success--they are above morality, above criticism...In effect no crime is committed unless a criminal is caught"" (187).Unlike many of Steinbeck's novels, this one uses a good deal of inner character monologue to reveal the protagonist's train of thought. In that way, the writing style is not typical of the simplistic narration that Steinbeck often uses, and sometimes there is more to what Ethan is thinking or doing than it actually seems. Some have both praised and criticized Steinbeck for using characters to project aspects of human morality, and The Winter of Our Discontent, his last novel, is no exception. While I didn't enjoy this novel as much as some of his other stuff, there are flashes of exceptional writing. For any Steinbeck fans, this is a novel that is a bit different than the others in that we are taken away from the California setting, and into the character's point of view.";1
147000;"As one of the most curmudgeonly people I know, I was looking forward to a good grousing session with Bernard Goldberg's 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. Moreover, to keep in the Oscar-the-Grouch mode, I found myself raising my fist and yelling ""Yeah!"" ten or twelve times. ""Yeah, Jesse Jackson!"" ""Edward Kennedy, yeah!""The book comes down to a plea for more many-sided, civilized discourse. Who would object? I wish the positive agenda the criticism implies had been more explicitly spelled out, but doing so would have made this a more serious book than it pretends to be.As for Goldberg's choices, some, to my mind, are arguable. Norman Mailer, even when one disagrees with him, is part of what is good about America-provocative, imaginative, daring, fearless. Ingrid Newkirk, on the other hand, has so little influence outside her kooky, half sympathetic enclave that I doubt she's screwing up anyone except herself and a few clothiers. The discussion of Paul Begala seems to me unfocussed and inconclusive. The influence of Michael Moore, number one, is confined to those who believe as he does, his heading the list makes the rest hoist by its own petard.Ultimately, the book falls prey to that which it inveighs against. Given its title, for instance, Goldberg should not object to someone swearing on a cell phone in an airplane, nor should he dismiss Courtney Love (who takes her seriously?) with the single word ""Ho."" To cavil too much, though, is not to read the book at all.There is someone who is screwing up America. However, we elected him and are thus complicit.";1

614174;I first saw several movie versions of &#34,The Scarlet Pimpernel&#34, and always wanted to see the Play. With the purchase of a Kindle and text-to-speech I could not afford to pass up the book.I was amazed to see that the book started out like the movies with the telling of the blood lust of the French revolution and how one man for the sport of it saved many from the guillotine thwarting the authorities and tricking the sergeant at the city gate into letting him through.Then I was afraid the story was going to bog down as we took a long time to drudge through a scene in an inn. I did not realize that this was to introduce the major players in the soon to be mystery.The essence of the story was best said in the book:&#34,Only between these two hearts there lay a strong, impassable barrier, built up on pride on both sides, which neither of them cared to be the first to demolish.&#34,The story really picks up after Marguerite realizes what she has done by giving away the pimpernels identity and disides to make amends.Usually I cannot stand flowery writing or long descriptions of feelings. But for some reason this book was so well written that what would seem like extraneous information actually enhanced the tale. I also noticed it is told mostly from Lady Blakeney's point of view.Once again this is a case of the book being better than the movie. I was surprise to find the Pimpernel poem came from the book:They seek him here they seek him thereThem Frenchies seek him everywhere.Is he in Heaven?Is he in Hell?That damned elusive pimpernel.;1
107534;This book is difficult for me to describe.  In keeping somewhat with the character of Shadow, I see this book as merely existing until fairly close to the end when it comes alive.If you choose it to be, this book can be delightfully mind-blowing.  Or it can just be an interesting and imaginative fantastical story.  Or it can just be a bland bit of hopping about aimlessly from one small adventure to the next.I take from it: embrace the past, relish the future, live the present.  Simplistically, we are all the same yet different.  But we each, when broken down to our minute parts, are complex individuals built of our own experiences and perspectives.  Gods are in our history, present and future, they just change based on need and relevance, but never disappear because history remains a part of us.I liked, but not loved, this book.  I suspect, though, that this is one of those books that requires a re-visit somewhere down the road.Ambiguous review?  Ambiguous book merits ambiguous review.  Frankly, the reader will gain what he gains from it, and it might be something entirely different from what I did.  That said, I am glad I bought this, and encourage all to read it.;1
60270;I have been reading (and now re-reading) Elmore Leonard for decades and I plan to do the same, if I'm lucky, for at least another decade or two.  Leonard, who is now 86 years old, shows little sign of slowing down or losing his momentum.  In fact, if the television series Justified is any indication, his work is as popular as ever.  Considering that almost 20 of his books have been made into Hollywood movies, and another half-dozen or so into television movies or series, that is saying something.52 Pick-Up, first published in 1974, is one of Leonard's earlier novels - and, despite being set in a Detroit that is almost unrecognizable today, it still holds up well.  Leonard has always been one of the great masters of realistic dialogue, and dialogue is one of this novel's strong suits.  Leonard's dialogue is special because he captures more than just cadence and accent.  After a few pages of a Leonard novel, the reader begins to hear each character as a unique and recognizable voice that exposes as much about himself in speech as he does by his actions.Our 52 Pick-Up hero Harry Mitchell is a happily married Detroit businessman who seems to have everything going for him - until he makes one fatal mistake and falls in love with a woman he meets in a bar.  Harry is a full-speed-ahead kind of guy, and before long he is spending most of his spare time at the apartment he rented for the second love in his life.  When blackmailers threaten to expose Harry's affair to his wife, he refuses to play their game, preferring to confess to his wife and directly confront his tormentors.  And then the blackmailers up the ante with a homicide, and it's game on.  Sometimes it is just not easy to be a blackmailer.52 Pick-Up is not one of Elmore Leonard's better known novels (those would have to be the ones that were turned into bigger movies and series such as Hombre, Mr. Majestyk, Get Shorty, Jackie Brown (Rum Punch), and the current Justified, but it is one that Leonard fans are sure to enjoy.  These early Leonard works may be a little more difficult to find sometimes, but the extra effort is worth it.;1
138376;"Robert W. Walker does a tremendous job conveying the spirit and atmosphere of a city emerging from its own shadows in his second Alastair Ransom mystery. Unfortunately, most of the rest of the novel is so incoherent that it's hard to care.Rebuilding from the fire that nearly wiped it from the map and the history books, Chicago hosted the Colombian Exposition in 1894 - a world-wide success that ensured the vitality of the city for the hundred + years since. But dark deeds also occured as an influx of people from across the country migrated to Illinois that summer. Walker's mystery records some of these deeds, and ventures into some pretty dark territory while doing so.Recovering from injuries sustained in the first novel, ""City for Ransom"", Inspector Ransom is shocked to discover the man accused of the murders featured in his first case is released from prison. He then decides to take the law into his own hands, and makes sure the villain meets a suitable ending at the bottom of Lake Michigan.The book then abruptly switches focus, and Ransom becomes embroiled in a case of the missing daughter of a prominent Chicago citizen, while he deals with superiors who are out to disgrace him,gangs of homeless children, and an implausible romance with a woman doctor impersonating a man that even Ransom can't explain.Ransom is not a likeable character, but more than that, the author injects action that doesn't make sense. More than once I was forced to go back and re-read a passage to find out what happened.Which is a shame, because, at its heart, 'Shadows in the White City' has a darned good central plot that will have even the most jaded mystery reader nervously checking their windows. And there's a cast of characters that are individual and complex enough to propel the series into the double digits. But they are currently constrained in awkward plotting and semi-ridiculous situations. Fans of Erik Larson's 'Devil in the White City' will no doubt have their interest piqued by this novel, as mine was, but we deserve better.";1

203920;I bought this book as I felt like reading the book that the film, Hellraiser was based on, would help me like the film more than I originally did. I found the film tedious and at times just downright confusing, so to read the book I should not have been surprised to find it was much better than the film in almost every way. The fact that Clive Barker not only wrote the book, but had almost everything to do with the first movie is almost disappointing. It seems to me that the film would have been better if made by a fan of the book and not the author itself, as the film seems to have taken on a more simple view and drawing a lot away from what made the book the exhilarating read I found it to be.The plot of the book focuses around the object of the Lemarchand Puzzle Box. This puzzle box opens a portal to hell which releases torturous demons known as Cenobites, who reveal themselves to the person who unlocked the puzzle and promise them eternal pleasure, which turns out to be unthinkable sadomasochistic torture. Rory and his wife Julia move into an old house inherited by Rory and his brother Frank from their deceased grandparents. Frank hasn't been seen by Rory since his wedding, but he was in their new home just a year before alone trying to solve the Lament Configuration. Since his solving of the puzzle and meeting the Cenobites, he hasn't been seen since, but that is until Rory cuts his hand thus starting a murderous rampage.The story is exhilarating from start to finish and at times purely frightening to the point where I expected to be startled at an event I was certain would be coming. Unfortunately that startling event didn't happen, but what did happen was a series of descriptively gifted events that set the tone for a truly great book. The character of Julia is someone I hope I never meet. Although defined as almost biblically beautiful, her dark and sinister lust brought out an evil side that I found myself believing it to be unlikely to exist. Rory is a dorky and forgettable character and the Cenobites don't play a huge role in the book which is surprising, considering the cult status gained by the movie version of the pinhead Cenobite which is in the book also.The Cenobites seem almost more human in the novel than their movie counterparts which I felt was a let down to what was up to that point a flawless book. You don't expect the demons to converse in a normal and social style, but in this they do tend to take that position especially with their first confused introduction with Frank. Apart from the forgettable Rory, the characters featured within are brilliant in their human reactions to events taking place. Julia is a woman you know has that dark streak but hides it well. Kirsty who in the book takes the form of a neighbour is the caring and curious friend of Rory and Frank of course is the first person to succumb to the wrath of the Cenobites and looks at escaping their grasp by getting his confused lover, Julia to bring him bodies to feed on.It's a delightful book with all the workings of a true horror, and I think the first Hellraiser could have been much better if Barker hadn't tried changing some of the best parts of the whole book to try and make what he must have thought to be a better movie. If you haven't seen the movie, then I would say give this a go first, and if you like this then try the movie but don't expect a carbon copy.;1
260166;"Don Ariely is a guy who had a lot of time to think.Severly burned in an accident, Ariely spent months pondering the various oddities of human economic behavior.And thankfully his pondering has left us with a very thought provoking book which shows that rather being ""reasonable"" market participants humans are for the most part ""emotional"" market participants.They'll spend time debating between a several cent difference on products then fritter thousands of times more than that difference on frivolous purchases.  They'll follow supposed leaders when a little bit of independent intiative could've put them much further ahead.And they'll readily impute their irrationality to others.In general this is one of a spate of recent highly readable neuroeconomics books which seriously discusses the emotional side of human economic behavior.  For those who have their interest picqued by this book I would suggest also the most recent economics book by Michael Shermer as well as Sway...both of which I've reviewed and also found to be excellent books.";1

She's now a widow and both feel guilty for falling in love and betraying the man, the Colonel, that they both loved and respected.

I still felt a sense of longing after I was done with the novel. The book is about Chloe Robinette,an ex-call girl who now works for an ex-lawyer Anthony Paradisio (AKA Mr.Paradise).What does she do? Pretty much anything the man wants. She dresses up in a skimpy cheerleading outfits and cheers while Mr.Pardise watches Detroit football games. One night she convinces her roomate Kelly Barr to join her. Kelly resists at first, but eventually gives in.

51910;Readers who have not yet read this book will be surprised to learn that the main topic is not race, but how intelligence explains class structure. The authors argue that intelligence, not environment is the primary determinant of a variety of social behaviors, including class, socio-economic level, crime, educational achievement, welfare, and even parental styles. Hernstein and Murray back up these claims with some of the most persuasive data ever seen in the social sciences. The importance of a person's intelligence cannot be understated. Its is the number one determinant in shaping one's life.  Hernstein and Murray do not stop there however. They go on, arguing that the bottom 15 percent in intelligence are simply not capable of taking care of themselves, falling into poverty, drugs, alchoholism, etc. American society can no longer accept such conditions for lower cognitive class. They make concrete suggestions on how to change this condition.  They also make striking claims about the danger of affirmative action programs in promoting people who are not qualified to do important tasks. And finally, they deal with the issue that makes this book so controversial: The lower tested intelligence of African-Americans. At no point do they the claim the gap is only due to genetics. They suggest past environmental factors come into play. But their main point is that modern day racism cannot explain the gap, and programs designed to bridge that gap will fail, and putting underqualified individuals in important positions is not the answer. The authors really do not go into detail about why the gap exists, setting themselves up for criticism.  But at least another scholar can research this topic and try and explain it. In sum, this book explains class structure in America, as well as the many of the social maladies of our time. It offers proof, and conrete solutions. It is a book of monumental importance, and cannot be denounced as racist. Those who make such claims either did not read the book, or are too biased to think objectively. As Murray notes in his new afterword, modern Sociology is riddled with taboos and self-censorship. The radical leftists who dominate the field do this country a great disservice by being so biased and non-objective. They also refuse to look at biology, relying only on environmental explanations, despite pyschology's growing reliance on genetic determinants of human behavior. The general public can only hope that the field right itself. Until it does, there will no solution to our most pressing social problems.;1

541102;"The cover of ""The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time"" intrigued me, and if you think so too, you would enjoy this!  When young Christopher finds his neighbor's dog, Wellington, impaled by a garden fork, he is prompted to investigate the murder, write a book, and do several others things he normally wouldn't do.  Some of the reviews online criticized the book because the killer of Wellington was revealed halfway through the book.  These readers must not have recognized that the murder of Wellington was not so much the main plot, as it was a catalyst for autistic Christopher to express himself through writing to the reader.  The theme of autism was presented in a way that allowed the reader to appreciate Christopher's quirky behavior, but also laugh along with him as he attempted to overcome his issues to solve the mystery.I laughed throughout the book at Christopher's quirky behavior and odd interpretations of life.  For example, because he knows every prime number up to 7,057, he numbers the chapters in the book with prime numbers rather than by numerical order beginning with 2.  (I noticed this on the first page and thought maybe I was missing the first chapter).  Taken out of context the humor would be lost if I tried to relate to you what was so funny about Christopher's escapades.  I can only say if you read the first few pages and laugh like I did, you will enjoy this book.  Though humorous, the author presented themes of love, patience and trust, all of which are difficult for Christopher to understand because he was autistic.This is one of my favorite books this year.  It is a light read that would entertain anyone with a sense of humor and a compassionate heart.Reas more of my reviews on my blog [...]";1

131584;"""The book may not convince detractors, but it sketches a vivid portrait of Cheney as an intelligent, quiet leader committed throughout his career, even as a member of Congress, to strengthening the power and authority of the executive branch"" (Publishers Weekly). That one line seems to epitomize (unintentionally or ironically) everything wrong with: 1. this book, 2. its subject, and 3. its author.1. What is wrong with the book is neither its style nor its substance. This book is extremely well written. Stephen Hayes' editorial and authorial talents are excellent. He also ""conducted more than six hundred interviews of people who have known Cheney over the course of his lifetime"" (page xi) to create this book. Excellent research, excellent writing, excellent editing, excellent photographs. Possessing all those virtues, however, this book is neither excellent, nor good, nor - truthfully - even marginal. What's wrong is the book's surreal quality, which conveys a sentimental message of ""All is well, gentle reader, in Washington. A firm hand is at our wheel of state. Rest easy, brave patriot.""2. What is wrong with its subject is well documented. Dick Cheney is a NeoConservative hawk instrumental in leading the US into what British MP George Galloway termed ""a war based on a pack of lies"". Cheney has  repeatedly refused congressional oversight of his office (claiming he is not a member of the executive branch and therefore immune), has told Senator Pat Leahy on the floor of the Senate to ""f-k yourself"", and has consistently maintained publicly in defiance of all evidence to the contrary that ""Saddam was responsible for 911"".3. What is wrong with its author, Stephen Hayes, also is well documented. Overly documented. Hayes' book, The Connection: How al-Qaeda's Collaboration With Saddam Hussein Has Endangered America, has been thoroughly debunked through findings of the official 911 commission and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Similarly debunked journalism by Hayes includes his 2003 articles Case Closed, and Dick Cheney Was Right.So there's a great deal wrong with this excellently produced book. While we all are sufficiently sophisticated to understand that an authorized biography of an incumbent must have its share of pabulum, it is fair to say Hayes breaks the jar:""[Cheney] is a perfect compliment to the man he serves - the man who campaigned for president as a compassionate conservative and who wears that compassion openly, the man who weeps publicly when discussing victims of tragedies that have happened under his watch. George W Bush cares most deeply about the softer issues, the connective tissue of the body politic: promoting faith-based initiatives, leaving no child behind, promoting democracy and human freedom in those places least hospitable to such ideals.... Cheney is Bush's opposite. He thinks government should do a few things well and otherwise leave its citizens alone. Defend the country. Cut taxes. Get out of the way. Cheney rarely gets carried away in the moment"" (page 4).That almost reads like a satiric jibe penned by Mark Twain or Jonathan Swift. And it is hard to credit that anyone as politically savvy as Stephen Hayes wasn't laughing when he wrote it. But to Hayes' credit, he nowhere mentions in his list of attributes for these two great men any respect for supporting and defending the Constitution. As for reviewers who say, ""Ignore the message and focus on the book's excellence"", we might as justifiably argue the same for Mein Kampf, Mao's Little Red Book of Quotations, or Machiavelli's The Prince. The simple truth is we're all tired of being lied to, and it doesn't matter how much lipstick you put on the pig - it's a pig.""'Am I the evil genius in the corner that nobody ever sees come out of his hole?' Cheney said in 2004. 'It's a nice way to operate, actually'"" (page 3).";1
534648;This is the first Crichton book that I've read and I was pleasantly surprised by both the depth and breadth of the research that he very clearly put into it.  Crichton is one of those select people that are on the upper echelon of intelligence and it really shows through with the minutiae and detail that he uses.  Whether it's the description of the botany, genetics, or computer systems, it's obvious that this dude put in the time.As far as the story goes, it's very different than the movie.  While many of the characters are here from the movie, the majority of them are different in dramatic ways.  Hammond, the grandfatherly old man from the movie, is more cynical, delusional, and money driven in the book.  Grant doesn't hate kids.  The kids ages are reversed.  It hugely expands on Ian Malcolm's (&#34,Life uh uh... Finds a way.&#34,) thought processes and shows how he really is Hammond's foil.These changes serve to make the book a more realistic story.  That may sound strange given the backdrop of artificially engineered dinosaurs, but the motivations behind the characters seem more convincing in this portrayal than they did in the movie.  The story is less focused on major cinematic encounters and more focused on the overall danger associated with the park.While there are fewer big bang moments than in the movie, the overall story is more cohesive, with motivations becoming more fleshed out and characters becoming more understandable.;1
140605;"This is a good ""connect the dots"" book, Wilentz breaks no new investigative ground, but does a good job of showing how the ""Age of Reagan"" carried far beyond the Gipper's end of service.As I alluded in my review title, whether consciously on his part or not, Wilentz has Cheney ""popping up"" on a regular basis, usually connected in some way to his defining, formulating and trying to advance his ""unitary executive"" ideas.And, although Wilentz doesn't postulate an official ""Age of Cheney,"" nonetheless, the looming end of Reaganism that he discusses in his epilogue certainly applies to Cheneyism as well.With his ""connect the dots"" work, Wilentz stimulates some counterfactual history thoughts:1. What if Reagan had been less amateurish in his 1968 attempt to wrestle the GOP nomination from Nixon? (My prediction: Even the war-saddled HHH would have beaten him and Reagan would have been on the ash-heap of history.)2. What if George H.W. and not Rocky had been Ford's (correcting erroneous Nixon's) VP appointment?3. What if Gorbachev hadn't, in essence, bailed out Reagan's second term? Would we even be talking about the ""Age of Reagan""?4. How would the Clinton years have been different if he had tried welfare reform before national healthcare?5. How would they have been different if Jeff Gerth hadn't been ax-grinding at least, mendacious at worst, about his pre-1992 election ""coverage"" of Whitewater?6. Would Gore had been better served with another VP candidate than Lieberman, one who didn't care about Clinton's Lewinsky issue one way or the other, like a governor?Wilentz certainly isn't alone in postulating the crackup of the GOP on the splintering of libertarians, big biz conservatives and social conservatives, but by doing a good overall job of showing how and why they coalesced around Reagan (though this could have stood another 20 pages or so), he shows more of why they're likely to split.";1
548857;"Warning potential spoilers here.I really enjoyed the first three-fourths of this novel. Perhaps this explains why the final portion was such a let-down. The author creates an interesting three-level mystery: a literary puzzle involving a mysterious medieval text, a strange interactive computer game, and an enigmatic British aristocratic couple.There are evidently connections between the three parts, and I was looking forward to finding out what they were. Some links were obliquely revealed, but most were not, so we are left with three chunks of a story that didn't really fit together. Also, perhaps most annoyingly, the final motivations of most of the main characters were left unstated, as if their reasons for doing what they did were irrelevant. This had the effect trivializing everything that happened before.The book ends on a certain note and I was left wondering ""Who? What? Where? Why? Especially, Why? Is this a the first of a new sub-genre in the mystery-thriller category in which nothing really gets resolved and characters act with no apparent motivation?";1

122853;The people who gave this book five stars must be on Ms. Alexander's payroll.  I have dearly loved several of her books, but the plot lines in this one were so extraordinarily contrived that I ceased to care about the characters only half-way through the book.  There is no emotional involvement between the two leads and absolutely no depth to them whatsoever.  The dialogue is way too modern, even for me (I'm not usually a stickler for historical accuracy, but this was too much).  I have to admit I didn't even finish the book.  When the heroine became furious with the hero (enough to say she never wanted to see him again) over something he did that was actually a kind, above the call of duty gesture because it wounded her pride - I'd had enough.  The last sixty pages will remain forever unread.  Please save yourselves the $7.;1
624402;"Charlemagne looms over the history of Europe. Nearly everyone knows that this Latin-derived name belongs to a now ancient Emperor. Fewer may know that ""Charles the Great"" has influenced European, and, along with it, western civilization for the past millennium. For one, the Renaissance revival of the eighth century script known as Carolingian Minuscule (from ""Karolus,"" Latin for ""Charles""), survives in modern lowercase type. Not to mention that his empire, the largest one in Europe following the fall of Western Rome, divided into kingdoms for his descendants provided the geographical and cultural foundations of modern Europe. Though following the path back to Charlemagne from the present would likely challenge many with even general historical knowledge, his name nonetheless rings out through the now murky ages as ""the founder of Europe.""The fall of the Western Roman empire in 476 probably remains the best starting point for situating Charlemagne's eventual rise. Following this fall, Europe became somewhat of a chaotic hodge-podge. Soon, groups of scattered tribes known as the Franks, inhabiting much of modern France, unified under Clovis. This succession, known as the Merovingian line, continued up until Charlemagne's father, Pippin III, overthrew the last Merovingian king, Childeric III, in the 750s. The death of Pippin's other son, Carloman, cleared the way for Charlemagne's rule and the Carolingian Renaissance. Sadly, this Renaissance was relatively short lived following Charlemagne's death. One person who witnessed this peak of Frankish rule was Einhard, one of Charlemagne's closest aids.  Einhard wanted to honor this highly regarded Emperor to keep his greatness from being ""swallowed up in the shadows of oblivion."" He succeeded. The runaway success of ""Vita Karoli"" inspired others, including the intriguingly named Notker the Stammerer, who wrote apparently at the request of Charles III, or Charles The Fat, yet another of Charlemagne's countless descendants. The small volume ""Two Lives Of Charlemagne"" collects these rather distinct biographies, providing a fascinating juxtaposition. Whereas Einhard lived and worked with Charlemagne, Notker, born in 840, never met his famous subject or Einhard. By the time Notker wrote, Charlemagne had already drifted into the realm of legend.By contrast, Einhard's text displays unquestionable intimacy. It begins with a sort of an apology. Einhard wants to convince the reader that, by writing about the famous Emperor, he doesn't seek his own fame by association. He claims that, of all people, he remains the most qualified to preserve Charlemagne's memory. A short preface added later by Walahfrid Strabo, who knew Einhard, emphasizes this and mourns the dimming of the Carolingian Renaissance, where ""studies are growing weak, and the light of wisdom because it is less loved grows rarer amongst most people."" That Walahfrid died around 849 attests to the Carolingian Renaissance's short duration. Nonetheless, the influence of Einhard's book kept the memory alive.Einhard's book is short, comprehensive and very organized. So much so that Walahfrid easily added topical section headers (that seem to go out of synch during the second section, but this may result from skewed pagination). Einhard covers a lot of ground, beginning with the Merovingians, who he largely dismisses as ""kings in name only."" These potentially exaggerated claims may have served as Carolingian justification for the preceding line's overthrow. The rise and glorification of Charlemagne follows. So much so that one could categorize the book as an extended paean, though Einhard's prose remains level headed and dignified throughout. First tales of war appear, including the ending of the Aquitianian war, unfinished by Pippin, then the defeat of the Lombards, the Saxons, the killing of Roland by the Basques (the inspiration for ""The Song of Roland""), the subjugation of the Bretons, the Beneventans, Duke Tassilo of Bavaria, the Slavs or Welatabi, the Avars and the Danes. An entire section praises Charlemagne for the territory he added to the kingdom, one of the most necessary of the traditional kingly duties. More praise follows for Charlemagne's treatment of ""foreign peoples,"" a skill that likely helped keep his empire intact, his building projects, including the chapel at Aachen. Many know that Charlemagne enjoyed the intimate company of women, and Einhard names many concubines and wives who fathered the Emperor's children, though he admits that one concubine's name escapes him. More biography follows with the deaths of two sons and a daughter. Here Einhard admits that Charlemagne, though he possessed ""greatness of spirit,"" nonetheless wept at these losses. The daughters that did live were not allowed to marry, which Einhard, and likely others, found strange. Another son, Pippin the Hunchback, tried to overthrow his father and was exiled. More personal information follows, including details of Charlemagne's physical stature, diet, clothing, hobbies and enjoyments, generosity and his studies. This section includes extensive footnotes showing the influence of Suetonius on Einhard, almost to the point where one could justifiably suspect that Einhard may have ""tweaked the truth"" to depict Charlemagne in the same light as the Roman Emperors. Almost. Despite his ability to speak and understand several languages, Einhard claims that Charlemagne never learned to write. The account of his famous crowning by Pope Leo in 800 also includes that claim that Charlemagne was tricked or surprised into receiving the crown, but that he bore it ""with patience."" Lastly, he declares his son Louis, who became Louis The Pious, as heir, dies on January 28 and is entombed in Aachen the same day. To further prove Charlemagne's legendary status, Einhard relates many portents of his death, some of which Charlemagne apparently chose to ignore. The book ends with a relatively lengthy, supposedly verbatim, note on how Charlemagne wanted his treasures divided up.Notker's book, ""The Deeds Of Charlemagne"" or ""Gesta Karoli,"" differs greatly in tone, organization and narrative from Einhard's more formal text. Notker, a poet and a monk who described himself as ""toothless and stammering,"" sometimes meanders away from Charlemagne into tales of wayward bishops or clerics, then digresses into heroics of Louis the Pious or other digressions. He catches himself and apologizes more than once for these diversions. The work also addresses Charles III ""The Fat"" directly in a few places. Charles III, both a King and an Emperor, ordered Notker to compose this somewhat sporadic but nonetheless entertaining work. Section 18 contains Notker's declaration, directly to the King, that writing this work may incur the wrath of other clergy, but the King's protection justifies any backlash. Notker tells numerous stories of Charlemagne's love of wisdom (including his patronage of Alcuin), mercy for the disadvantaged, and how he deals with immorality, which often come across as morality tale pranks. In section 7, after relating a story about lections and responsories, Notker doubles back, interrupting the flow, because he forgot to mention something in the previous section. Later he relates a story of a ""hated man"" who wins his master's favor by claiming a miracle in his name. He claimed to have caught a fox by merely stating ""In the name of my master Recho, stay still and don't move."" In reality he set two small dogs on the fox and snatched it from their jaws early enough to show no damage. Another story tell of a man who dresses as a leper ""running with pus and in rags stiff with putrid gore"" to show up a Bishop who had claimed to wash everyone in town in penance for eating meat during Lent. Yet another Bishop falls to drunkenness and sleeps with a woman ""with the moves of a harlot"" and pays a penance of weeping before his congregation. Section 29 tells the grisly tale of a man who promises Charlemagne to cast a bell of fine silver, but secretly keeps the silver and gets crushed and disemboweled by the bell's iron clapper when he pulls the cord. Other stories of Charlemagne, covering similar ground to Einhard, weave in and out of the text, then suddenly book one ends announcing the death of Werinbert, who had served as the source for many of the tales. No source, no book, so Notker turns to Adalbert, who served Charlemagne in the war against the Avars, as the source for the second book. The story of the Avar war, and the peculiar concentric hedgerows surrounding the Avar stronghold, opens the next and final book. One of the best stories appears in section six when one of Charlemange's envoys violates a solemn rule in Constantinople that foreigners cannot turn over their food when dining. He turns over his fish unknowingly and the King says he must be put to death, but first the king will grant him one favor.  The envoy says that he wants everyone who saw him turn the fish over to have their eyes put out. At this, everyone conveniently forgets about the entire incident. ""Fish? What fish?"" The rest of the book spins in and out of stories about Charlemagne then turns to Louis the Pious and Louis the German and suddenly ends abruptly and in mid-sentence. A more sudden of an ending remains difficult to imagine. The ride just stops. Some have theorized that Notker had not finished the work when Charles III was deposed in 887 and, upon hearing of this, Notker simply stopped writing.""Two Lives of Charlemagne"" presents basically the same story in two dramatically different ways. Einhard comes across as more encyclopedic and courtly while Notker appears almost anarchic and frenzied. Though many will probably learn more about Charlemagne from Einhard's solid narrative structure, Notker's chaotic and occasionally Rabelaisian ride is overall more fun, though often less comprehensible. The book also includes excellent introductions to Charlemagne, Einhard and Notker. These give context, chronologies, a map and even a helpful lineage from Pippin I to Charles III. Voluminous end notes point out citations from numerous Roman and Biblical sources which both ancient authors drew from extensively. Lastly, the relatively recent translation of both texts flows smoothly throughout and presents an effortless and enjoyable read. These books possess the power to transform the reader back to an age of Kingdoms and Empires when modern Europe just began to show through the haze and mist. They also doubtlessly helped heighten the legend and the myth of Charlemagne to such an extent that many still know his name even today.";1
378475;"This book is right up there with Loretta Chase's ""Lord of Scoundrels,"" it's an instant romance classic.Eloisa James is not one for convention. She plays with romance tropes in all of her novels - her heroes might have a beer belly or be bad lovers, while she makes a heroine out of an unfaithful wife. So I was surprised to see her take on the tried and played-out story of beauty and the beast. I bought the book in the hopes that she would do something interesting and unexpected with it.And she did. Instead of a sweet young thing taming a beast, we get two kindred souls who bring out each other's best and truest selves. He brings out her snark, while she smooths out his manners. They are equally prickly and equally kindhearted. Their chemistry is so smoky it burns up the pages, but they don't get together until they've worked for and earned it. James does a great job moving them from curious strangers to loving partners.I can't rave about this book enough.The only thing I didn't like was that the hero reminded me of House, from the TV show, whom I hate. I was able to push the thought aside until I finished and read the Acknowledgements, where James says flat out that House inspired her. Now I'm worried I can't go back and read without thinking of him. Blech.But I doubt that's going to bother most people. This book is a fun, sexy, sweet, and nearly pitch-perfect romance novel.

402132;"""Dating back to the 1950s, it was not uncommon for Nigerian families to send their children to live with white families in England in a situation best described as private fostering.  Rather than go through agencies similar to those here in America, families would simply advertise their child in the local papers, in hopes that a family would be willing to raise them until they were ready to do so themselves.  Unlike foster care in the U.S., the birth parents paid the families directly for the care of their child.  In most instances, the parents were not poor or seemingly neglectful, as are many parents in America's system.  Rather, these were parents that came to England to pursue education or job opportunities and, hindered by their children, sent them to a full time family to care for them until time and money afforded them the chance to do so themselves."" - excerpt from my review of Colorblind by Precious WilliamsBeing Lara is the story of Lara Reid, Nigerian by birth, English in spirit.  Adopted at three by a former English pop star and her husband, Lara has grown up in a household where she knows she is loved, but still longs for the piece of herself that she intuitively knows is missing.  When the missing piece shows up in the form of her birth mother on her thirtieth birthday, Lara questions if this is a prayer she truly wanted answered.Though the situation in Being Lara is not the same as the situation in Colorblind, I still found myself comparing the two.  While Precious in Colorblind, which is based on the author's true life story, was fostered to a family, Lara, a fictional character, is adopted.  However, both women find themselves questioning their differences from their white playmates as children and again, as adults, their co-workers, friends, etc. In both situations, the characters had problems with introduction to the Nigerian world that was unfamiliar to them.  The assumption from their birth parents seemed to be that they should naturally know and understand all things Nigerian.I appreciated Lola Jaye taking the time to not only tell Lara's story, but telling her mother's as well.  Too often the story is only told from the perspective of the adoptee, so I found Yomi's story fascinating.  It was also interesting to see Yomi's interactions with Lara's adopted parents. Most enjoyable, though, were Lara and her grandmother's conversations.  There was a lot of self-discovery for several of the characters.  This was my first read from Lola Jaye, but I was impressed enough that I'll be checking out more from her.Note: If you're interested in reading more about fostering and the long-term affects, I encourage you to read Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's, best known as Adebisi in HBO's Oz and Mr. Eko in Lost,  recent article in The Guardian.";1

311904;"I liked this book WAY more than I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, it was recommended by someone I trust so I knew I'd like it, I just didn't expect to love it as much as I did. Why? First, because I have never read any Dystopian novels (well, not since the Chrysalids in High School) and the description just didn't appeal to me. That sounds terrible, but I'm being honest. I would have never read this book based on the blurb. I only read it because it was a good friend I trust who recommended it--thank you, T'irla. Second, because of the nature of the story I expected a lot of world building--and sometimes a lot of world building equals boring. I fully expected to have to ""get through"" book one in order to start enjoying the story by book two. Well, that was not the case in Beyond the Night.Joss Ware has a talent, that's for sure. She doesn't just dump a ton of information on the reader in the beginning to introduce her world. She also doesn't leave you hanging for information either. She has found the perfect balance of telling her story and building the picture she wants us to see, without boring the reader to death. Fantastic job Ms. Ware!The characters were all so unique and interesting, different personalities and different backgrounds all coming together in a new world and working together to rebuild. And I absolutely loved that our hero and heroine find love under the circumstances. I literally felt butterflies in my belly in parts--and considering what was going on around them: amazing. There was also a lot of good tension. Romantic tension, suspenseful oh-my-god-are-they-going-to-get-out-of-this-alive-tension, and let's not forget sexual tension.Overall, I really recommend this book to everyone. I don't think you have to like paranormal or dystopian to enjoy this book. It's got a fantastic story line, good characters, a lot of suspense, and romance. What's not to like? I can't wait to get to book two.";1
174855;I have read several of Jodi Picoult's books, and have never been disappointed. This time, with &#34,Keeping Faith,&#34, she has outdone herself. Picault takes on a taboo topic, the evidence, in this secular culture, of Divine mystery. Picault speaks through the experience of a seven-year-old child, named Faith, who sees and converses with G!d, and who performs healings, and even a resurrection. Picoult details how all this affects the little girl, who was raised in a secular Jewish home, and how it changes her, her family and her world. Although from the outside all these phenomena seem unbelievable, the story is told with great sensitivity, and is successful when it asks us to suspend our disbelief.The themes are clear: what do we give up when we let go of the possibility of faith? What do we lose when we neglect things like awe, bliss, wonder, and the possibility that we are sometimes &#34,chosen&#34, to perform miracles? Indeed these miracles seem small, but only because they are common. On the surface it seems as if the one performing these miracles is the child. But actually she isn't the only one. It is her mother's and grandmother's love of her, and her mother's and grandmother's faith in Faith, that is the more profound miracle.;1

Through the years I have felt a sense of both fascination and frustration with Clinton, but always more of the former.  This audio abridgement of &quot,My Life&quot, is one of the best audio books that I have listened to.  It holds your interest and it moves at a lively pace.  The book itself is an important contribution to the political history of the U.S.A.  Sometimes Clinton is a little too preachy, but that is my only criticism.  Thanks to Starr and his other detractors Clinton does not have anything to hide and so he provides us with the most honest political and personal autobiography yet written.  Yes, he keeps his defenses up, but he discusses his flaws in a way that helps the reader gain insight into the human existence.

497693;Poetry (especially religious poetry) is always difficult to translate.  At one extreme a translation may be scholastically acurate but difficult to read and rather unpoetic.  At another extreme the translator may focus on the poetry at the expense of the meaning and force rhymes that sound really stupid in English.This translation avoids those pitfalls.  It is beautiful, easy to read, and full of meaning.  It never sounds like cheesy forced poetry or dry, dull scholasticism.  This translation also never tells you how to interpret it, but allows you to bring Rumi's words in line with your own experiences.But the true jem here is not Rumi's poetry itself but the introduction by philosophy professor Huston Smith.  I have often found Smith's introductions to books more fascinating than the books themselves.;1

405860;Maybe I have read too many of Daniel Silva's books, so the plot and the language are becoming too familiar to me.  It was a good read, but not an unforgettable story.  As a matter of fact, after few weeks I could not recall the ending... but maybe the holiday season had overloaded my mind... I will read his other books, but I do not have a very high expectations that a new writing style or a new plot will be devised.  I liked his earlier books better.  But, maybe it is just me being picky and getting bored with the same style and similar plots.;1
615782;"Hawthorne wrote The House of the Seven Gables during a time of social unrest in Europe and a time of questioning in the US. This was the same decade that Marx wrote ""The Communist Manifesto"" and that Thoreau went into the woods in order to live ""deliberately"" and not be a slave to material things. Everywhere in the western hemisphere, there were those questioning the material conditions of humankind: why were some people wealthy to excess, others starving? Why were some people good, others evil?Marx called for political action. Thoreau called for individual action. In The House of the Seven Gables, Hawthorne sought to show how old, accepted institutions and old accepted ways were crushing the life out of the present: were standing in the way of change. The character Holgrave, himself a harbinger of the future because he makes his living taking what are today called photographs, speaks for social change. The Pyncheon mansion, the house of the title, was built on murder and ill-gotten gains. In 200 years, no Pyncheon would step forth and confess the wrongs of the past and return the property to whom it belonged. And so, in what looks like a supernatural curse but might be only hereditary, each Pyncheon dies a horrible death which makes it seem as if he were ""choking in blood."" In this novel, the wrongs of the past are brought to light and made right.It's true that Hawthorne describes things to excess -- at least it seems like excess to our modern tastes. But this is a relatively short read, and the plot marches forward toward doom for some, liberation for others. And some serious thinking about right, wrong, and social justice for anybody who reads this book.";1
529206;I'm a huge fan of Bill Clinton. He's just not a great writer. I'm assuming his editor was too intimidated to tell him that he shouldn't include every tiny detail of his life.

It's like he was trying to score points with people--&#34,See, you're in the book!&#34, Honestly, I think his editor is far more to blame here than he.

282985;"It starts with a towering rant about everything that's wrong with modern society and how ""Christianity"" functions in that society.  The church is part of the problem, we've missed the central message of Jesus and created a culture-dominating religion that is a hypocritical mockery of everything the Nazarene prophet originally stood for.  ""Personal Salvation"" is a bunch of baloney.  ""Justification by faith"" is the most self-serving and diabolically destructive idea of our era.  Genuine Christianity is not about believing fairy tales, but about doing what's RIGHT in difficult circumstances, even when it is against one's own self-interest.  Meyers' brutal honesty does not let up til the last page.  It is exhilarating to read a ""religious"" writer who can cast off the shackles of orthodoxy and tell the unvarnished (but beautiful) truth.  Over the past few years I've spent a lot of time studying the Bible, delving into textual analysis, exegesis and ecclesiastical history - and the more I learn, the more mythical (and therefore less credible) the Gospel story becomes.  What is left to believe in when you know the Bible is at least 50% false, and all of our ""traditional"" doctrine was invented by a Church hybridized with paganism, centuries after the death of Jesus & everyone who knew him?This is what's left.  The ideas in this book are a defiant slap in the face to traditional, conservative, and fundamentalist churches.  That such ideas can still make it to print gives me hope that Christianity is not doomed to irrelevance.  This should be _mandatory_ reading for anybody professing to be ""Christian.""  This, and the Bible - the WHOLE Bible, not just the carefully selected portions they feed you on Sunday.  Without that knowledge base, we are going to continue missing the point, and getting the message wrong, and the Church as we know it will fade away .. and the demise of Christianity in that case will be well-deserved.";1
109744;I liked this book more than the previous two in the Wallflowers series, probably because the couple both have such dramatic character arcs. Sebastian is truly an ass at the start of this book, but redeems himself in a way that is entertaining if not particularly original. Evie transforms from a timid, stuttering mouse to a strong, stubborn woman. And this book introduces Cam Rohan of the Hathaways series (which I love so much more than the Wallflowers), though it pisses me off that in this book he's always described as 'the boy' though we're told he's twenty-five. That seems racist to me (given his Romany heritage), like calling black people &#34,boy&#34, even when they are fully grown men.;1
327104;"There are multiple reasons I shouldn't have liked this book. The style of the writing is different and strangely the book I had abandoned before this one was done in the same way. It was done where there was technically no dialogue or quotation marks, it was explained by our narrator what was going on and who said what.Joyce Maynard did this beautifully. This was such a joy to read and I enjoyed every moment of it, even the parts that seemed weird and out of place at first - Henry (13-year-old narrator) talking frequently about his mother's sex life. At times, I felt like this was impossible for a boy to talk about, especially in the fashion that he did, but it was done in such a way that it actually made me think of sex in general differently. There is a line in the book about his mother ""being in love with love"" that seemed to sum up his mother Adele in one sentence. Ironically (and something I loved about Adele) she didn't just fall for anyone, just her ex-husband and the convict Frank.How Maynard managed to make me fall in love with Frank given his history and violent past is beyond me. This is a love story like no other I've ever read and the fact that it is told by the son Henry makes it feel like it's not a romance novel (Thank Goodness.)I like stories about life, people, and the changes they go through and this is exactly what I got. It even had a redemptive ending that I was not expecting, a lovely surprise.";1

509368;"While I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to stock market investors, I didn't think it had the same depth and level of insight as Schwager's first two Market Wizards books, which I consider two of the most valuable volumes in my investment library. There were a few interviews that I liked, though, such as the one with Ahmet Okumus, the Turkish immigrant who buys quality stocks he thinks have been punished too much and will eventually turnaround. Furthermore, he sells puts on them when he thinks they're still overvalued for the options income, and if the stock declines to that level, he's actually delighted to have the stock ""put"" back to him since he really wanted to own the stock at that price anyway. This means he does exhaustive fundamental research and must be very accurate and confident in and of his valuation of the company for this to work, and his historical returns show he can make this work, too, as it significantly added to his overall performance. I thought that was an interesting strategy and an example of someone with a niche that they're able to exploit. I still found most of the other interviews worthwhile, though, and I would recommend this book to stock market investors since there is a lot of good advice about the pitfalls of investing there, too.";1

628904;"Set in 1950s South Africa, this short one-act play packs a lot of power. The play starts fairly slowly, building the scene and allowing the reader to get to know its three characters: the teenage Hally, who's white, and Sam and Willie, the two black men who work in Hally's mother's restaurant. Willie is a less developed character than the other two, he is a simple man who is thick-headed and abusive toward his girlfriend. More central to the play is the complex relationship between Hally and Sam, who are in a sense opposites--Hally is well-educated but arrogant, while Sam lacks formal education but is humble and wise. Sam has been a lifelong fixture in Hally's life, essentially raising Hally while his father spent his days drinking. Beneath their dynamic relationship is an undercurrent of racial tension, which builds to a powerful climax at the play's end.Much of the play's effectiveness owes to its portrayal of the subtleties of racism. It is clear that Hally views himself as an enlightened person, he espouses lofty ideals, tutors Sam in geography, and prides himself on the taboo friendship he had with the two black men as a child. When Sam finally gets him to take an interest in his passion of ballroom dancing, Hally seems to congratulate himself for finding some value in what he calls ""the release of primitive emotions through movement"" in a ""primitive black society."" Yet in his smugness, Hally is oblivious to what's really going on. For all his talk of the need for ""progress,"" he is unwilling to take personal responsibility for it, resigning himself instead to waiting for the next great social reformer to come along. He is condescending toward Sam and fails to realize he has anything to learn from the older man. However, the young man's ignorance comes through most poignantly when the two recall an incident during Hally's childhood where Sam took him to fly a homemade kite. We learn later that because of Hally's obliviousness toward Sam--and toward the sting of racism--his recollection of the event is missing a painful, essential truth that changes the story completely.MASTER HAROLD does leave the reader with a glimmer of hope, embodied by the dignity and compassion Sam maintains even when abandoning these virtues would be more than understandable. But the play also shows how formidable are the psychological obstacles standing in the way of change, and the degree to which racism causes suffering on both sides. Once the truly ugly side of Hally's view of Sam comes out, he becomes committed to it. Further, it's not just between Sam and Hally--Hally is burdened by the failings of the previous generation, and beneath his arrogance is a deep shame about his crippled, pitiful alcoholic father. In the end, one cannot help but feel for Hally, because of the damage his racism has done to the most important relationship he has.The dialogue in MASTER HAROLD is very real, yet it's also fraught with layers of meaning. That this play imbues a single sixty-page scene with so much significance, complexity, and wrenching emotion is a real testament to Fugard's masterful writing.";1
55616;"Wow.  I wasn't sure I'd really get into this book when I first started it, but I was hooked almost immediately.  What an incredible and complex individual!The Last Alchemist:  Count Cagliostro, Master of Magic in the Age of Reason by Iain McCalman is a remarkable biography of what amounted to a world class con-artist.  What makes him such an enigmatic individual is the fact that he was not simply a sociopath, but exhibited a compassion for the poor that endeared him to many.  From the point of view of history, as I've often said before, one often learns more from fringe figures and marginal places about periods in history than one does from those on center stage.  The story of Count Cagliostro confirms once again that belief.Although the author, and in fact many of the Count's contemporaries, credit him with ""causing"" the French Revolution and other disastrous events, I would say that he was more a symptom of the times than the cause of their events.  This is in fact the stance of at least one of the author's sources as well.The world of the 18th Century was one of transition (although one could plausibly argue that this is true of every age!).  The highly centralized, aristocratic and tyrannical political systems of the time were gradually being confronted with issues and intellectual concepts with which they were unprepared to deal.  The Catholic church, the other major political player, had been playing a losing game with science,  intellectualism, and protestantism for well over two centuries, and had retreated to the old stand by of incarcerating its enemies when they presented the opportunity.  The arbitrary abuse of individual rights, the desperate poverty of the bulk of the European population, the marginal existence that was reality for even the middle class in times of economic down turn, made it obvious that changes were well overdue.  This was the age of the philosophers of the American and French revolutions, of Paine, Voltaire, Hume, Rousseau and others whose literary support of human rights and of elected self government created a foment of intellectual unrest that ultimately produced much of what we consider to be the ""modern"" way of life.The selfish, greedy and often foolish individuals in positions of power and privilege made ready targets for someone of the Count's talent and predilections.  It is no accident that this was also the period of Casanova and Jeane de Mott, and other major imposters.  Concerned only with personal vanity, accumulation of wealth and power, in short with the status quo at all levels, the wealthy of Europe were easy prey for someone with promises of physical youth and increased sexual prowess, with unlimited wealth and personal power, and with immortality.  If it had not been so tragic in other ways, the tales of some of these people and their encounters with the Count would have made wonderful comedy.  It is no wonder that the Count and his exploits provided creative people with plots for opera and story-both Mozart's Die Zauberflote (the Magic Flute) and Goethe's Fauste were based on the Count's exploits.Born Giuseppe Balsamo in Palermo, Sicily the self-styled Count Alessandro de Cagliostro, aka Colonel Joseph Pellegrini, was no stranger to the abject poverty of some of the poorer people he helped treat as a healer.  He grew tough and morally elastic surviving a childhood in the competitive environment of Italy.  His fortune was made when his mother's family attempted to educate him and prepare him for a life dedicated to the church.  Obviously bright, a quick learner, artistically gifted, and probably the possessor of a photographic memory, Giuseppe turned his hand to preying on the wealthy by appealing to their greed since it provided him with a lifestyle as affluent as that of his ""clients.""What I found most interesting was the man's ability to land on his feet with almost every set back.  The story of his legal fight with Jeane De Mott over the Diamond Necklace affair was amazing.  I also found the rapidity with which his reputation as a mountbank caught up with him surprising.  One would have thought that in an age innocent of telegraphy, the telephone, radio, television, airplanes, computers and the like, that such an individual could disappear by simply changing his name or even by simply moving.  It seemed that this was not the case, and even at this time, those who wanted to know more about the man could ""dig up the dirt"" with a little guesswork and research!  Part of this was no doubt the fact that the man traveled in a rarified society, that of the very wealthy and influential.  This class of people was very small and often known to one another, even occasionally related to one another, which made knowledge of the man's previous activities easier to transmit from one venue to another.An amazing book.For THOSE WRITING PAPERS: in history, sociology, psychology, anthropology, speech/communications, philosophy, political science, church history.  Did this man play a pivotal part in the revolutions that swept through Europe during the latter part of his life?  When he predicted the fall of the French throne, do you think he was politically astute, psychic, just vindictive?  How did this man reflect his society?  What social situations lead to the formation of many such individuals of this type?  What personal characteristics did the man have that made him more successful than many others?  What social situations during the period produced personalities of this type?  Would the Count have been just as sociopathic even had the social environment been different?  Why did so many people, like Seraphina, ultimately go along with his plans?  What changes if any did the treatment of the Count during the last months of his life bring about in the Catholic church?  What types of persuasion techniques did the Count use to influence his targets?  Are some of these same techniques used successfully today on us?  Who uses them?  Why do we still fall for them?";1
286015;I truely enjoyed the whole series. I realy liked the charters and Vlad was my fav. I thought it was a slow start in the first book but the series took off! The only thing i didn't like was the constant, through out the whole series, recap of charters who there were, where she met them, how long she's known them, blah, blah.Besides that, it was a great read. If you like vamps and love stories, try this series. Its a love story on speed! Lots of action and most of the time she is dressed like a tramp, but thats the whole point of what she's doing. She has to dress to do what needs to be done. Very good series.;1
73935;Harper Lee told a great story with this book about the way things were in the 30's.  Racism, poverty, and peer pressure were all expressed very well in the story, and it accurately depicts the struggles of standing up for an unpopular cause.

182576;"While this book may have been shocking upon publication, Reality Television has taken care to tame it into a kinder, gentler look into the hijinks of restaurants from Europe to Tokyo but most notably New York City.  As the writer confines in us ""People confuse me.  Food doesn't.""  That is the recurring theme in this book.  The writer's relationship with food is sometimes reverential, sometimes dismissive but always in the forefront of his mind and his words.The write spends a ridiculous amount of time reinforcing the vernacular we, the reader, already presume to know about the business and introduces us to more.  Much of what is described may be a bit more colorful or offensive than one might believe possible from their favorite restaurant or watering hole.  Many may presume such behaviors are reserved for chain restaurants where a chain smoking executive chef in a food splattered uniform would be de rigor.  Not so, says our writer.  Although smoking is now banned in New York City restaurants, one wonders how much may have changed in the more than a decade since this was first published.If just the mention of some place or thing familiar makes a reader more invested in a book, then that moment came for me, with a smile, when approximately halfway through there is mention of Big Barry's on Long Island.  A small restaurant chain from my childhood memories, immediately brought a involuntary knowing nob.  Just  one line slipped in, and that brought made this story closer to my frame of reference.The ubiquitous ""Big Foot"" here is not some mythical creature who leaves behind massive indentions in the mud but is never actually seen.  Instead he is a not named restauranteur with many lessons to teach an eager learner.  Most significant of these are that loyalty and honesty are rewarded in a business often hostile and uneven.The best bit of advise in this book is to check the cleanliness of the bathroom.  It makes sense.  If the common areas, such as the public bathroom, are not kept clean then imagine what is happening in the areas behind the swinging kitchen door.  You know that door.  It is the one that you cannot help but notice but cannot catch but a sliver or a glimpse behind.Clearly an interesting read.  A love affair with food and the restaurant business without any sappy muzak in the background.  You won't be turned off eating out.  You might look differently at the wait staff wondering what they were fed, or not fed, from the kitchen before their shift began.  You might wonder if the bartender is signaling out specific customers for deferential treatment.  You might speculate whether the chef was pleased or not, which is the more likely of the two, to have been called out of the kitchen to stop by a table of VIPs.  When you taste something sublime, you might just ponder the steps taken to bring you this memorable bite.";1

155557;Into a Dark Realm is the second book in Raymond Feist's, Darkwar Saga. The first book is titledFlight of the Nighthawks (The Darkwar Saga, Book 1)with the third, and final book of this trilogy, titledWrath of a Mad God (The Darkwar Saga, Book 3). What started with the first book in the Riftwar Saga,Magician: Apprentice (Riftwar Saga), and continued on in the Serperntwar Series, with more in the Serpentwar Saga, and the Conclave of Shadows Trilogy, is now in the latest installment of the world and characters. If you are even remotely considering reading this novel, and have not yet read all the previous novels, you really need to go back and start at the beginning. There are so many things that are alluded to, talked about, and consequences of, that if you do not have that previous knowledge base you may be hopelessly lost and confused.With that said, the plot, or more aptly, plots of this book carries over right from the previous novel. There are three basic plots of this book. First, there is Pug and his group seeking to find more information about a dire threat facing the worlds of Midkemia and Kelewan. The second plot revolves around a new character on a new world and the actions he undertakes to come into his own and fit in on his ruthless world. The third plot line, features returning characters Jommy, Tad and Zane and the things the Conclave asks them to do in order to be prepared down the road. Being a fan of Mr. Feist's previous work, I was really looking forward to this book and how it would progress the story. However, after finishing the novel I was rather disappointed by the story and plots. For one, the only plot I was really interested in was the Jommy, Tad, and Zane plot. That held my interest. However, the other two I really could care less about. It seemed to merely be repeated plot lines from past books. An evil threatens Pug's world, he assembles a band of peoples and goes to fight it. With the talent Mr. Feist has shown over the years, this was very disappointing. I had to stop myself several times from merely skimming chapters until I got to a Jommy/Tad/Zane scene. The magic of Mr. Feist's writing, is just not here in this book.The characters are almost exclusively characters we have seen before in past novels. Pug, Miranda, Caleb, Nakor, Bek, Jommy, Tad, Zane, et. al. One benefit of being able to carryover characters is that Mr. Feist does not have to expend copious amounts of words to set them up. The reader knows what to expect and where the character is at in terms of development. With that said, if you are looking for character development for any of the major characters, aside from Jommy, Tad, and Zane, you will be greatly disappointed. Bek does have some development, but nothing that will make the reader say wow. Pug remains the ultra powerful character and Nakor remains enigmatic. As I was reading, I kept waiting for some development and I was continually disappointed. I am just thankful Jommy and gang were in this novel, or I may not have finished it.Some things I did not care for with this novel were:As I said above, the seemingly repetitive plot involving Pg running around to save the world(s) from the next great evil. With as rich and detailed as Mr. Feist's world is, one would think there would be more plot diversity here.Also, there is a `twist' at the end of the novel that literally made me groan and almost throw the book across the room. It is quite clear from this novel that Mr. Feist has fallen in love with some of his characters and as such will not harm them or kill them off when it benefits the story. Sometimes, characters have to die, and stay dead for that matter. There is little surprise anymore when people keep popping up or running rampant through grave situations.Lastly, when all is said and done, the basic story arc, is not really moved ahead that much from where the book started. It seems like this novel was a short story puffed up into that of a three hundred plus page novel.The only real positives I see in this novel are:Mr. Feist's prose is still engaging, interesting, and easy to read. I have always felt comfortable reading his work. Like putting on an old pair of jeans. You know how they will fit.Secondly, as I mentioned above, the three characters of Jommy, Tad, and Zane. They kept parts of this novel interesting and made me want to learn more about them and what they were up to. Sadly, they were the only characters in the novel I felt that way about.I will certainly read Wrath of a Mad God, but if it is anything like this novel, it may very well be my last Feist novel I read involving these characters. For fans of Mr. Feist's work who have stuck it out this long, I am sure you will want to read this book, if for no other reason then to get one book closer to finishing the story. For people who have not read Feist's work, seriously start with Magician: Apprentice and work your way up and see if/when you feel like stopping reading his novels. It seems the last couple of novels penned by Mr. Feist have been hit or miss, and that is disappointing. I believe Mr. Feist needs to get back to the roots of what made his work so special in the first place and not all this multiple planes of existence stuff.;1
46215;Let's say you know nothing about Islam. But you want to learn everything about it that can be learned in one book, and in a readable format. Pick up Denny. He covers the full gamut of psychology, religion, history, sociology, and much more, in a way the layman can easily understand. There are times when he seems to accept a little too much the Muslim version of history without investigating it further, but in general he seems to respect Islamic beliefs and still maintain a historical critical perspective. Especially helpful is the background in Mesopotamian beliefs, Judaism, and Christianity provided before hand. It frames the Islamic movement historically, and also provides an easy etic segue for the typical Western reader. And while Denny goes into great detail on orthodox and folk Islam, he is to be additionally commended for the sections on Sufism, which often get short shrift in scholarly works on Islam.The title is apt. After reading this, one will know Islam thoroughly at the introductory level.;1

573408;"Written by the most talented authorities in change management and systems re-engineering, this book should be required reading for every student and practitioner in health care industry. Champy is the former Chairman of Consulting for Dell Perot Services and the author of Reengineering the Corporation. Greenspun, MD, has served as the Chief Medical Officer at Dell, Northrop Grumman Corporation.The heart of this book has 3 chapters, one for each of the key components of any service: processes, people, and technology. Each of these three chapters ends with a checklist to make sure that the reader has learned the lessons. The book offers 2 chapters that recount personal experiences of health care re-engineering. At the outset and at the end of the book we find the motivational chapter and the chapter broadly outlining the opportunities in health care re-engineering.First, they ask why do we have a health care problem? Their answer is that the physicians, like many managers and engineers in the past, have been trained to accomplish their jobs independently, not in teams. The problem arises because health care delivery today demands teamwork.Next, they define the process of re-engineering health care: The radical improvement of health care delivery process to enhance quality and dramatically lower costs, while greatly expanding patient accessibility to that improved care. Four words in this definition - fundamental, radical, dramatic, and process - are key to re-engineering.If you study the typical office workflow, you discover that highly skilled doctors passionate about the patient care, spend only one third of their time practicing medicine. The two-thirds of their time is spent on administration, billing, documentation, and preparation. Also, people are the key to process. Poor relationships within the clinic staff will result in substandard care and lost revenue for the practice.Smartest Quote (p. 104):""Cognitive change just takes too long. We believe that changing what people do is the best way to change how they think.""Dumbest Quote (p. 81):""Making sure you understand exactly how the EHR technology will work in the physician's room before it's installed is one of the keys to successful implementation of the system.""  It's impossible to foresee exactly all the details. It's also not needed, as we've seen thousands of successful installations using a gradual approach, by improving at every stage through iterative solicitation of physician's feedback.All in all, a highly recommended book for everyone who cares about our health care system and a required reading for every student and executive in health care industry.Yuval Lirov, Medical Billing Networks and Processes - Profitable and Compliant Revenue Cycle Management in the Internet Age";1

594821;The despot, the octopus, in Frank Norris's forceful novel is the Railroad Cy (RR), which monopolizes the transport of agricultural products and sucks the life out of the farmers: `He searched for the true romance and found grain rates and unjust freight tariffs.' More, the RR owns big chunks of the land alongside the railway, which it `optionally' sold at a modest fixed price to the farmers as a counterpart for developing and exploiting the land. But the RR breaches the contracts.The farmers are not as indifferent as the vast majority of the masses and try to get control of the Board of Railroad Commissioners through bribery. A brutal and deadly fight explodes between the organized farmers and the delegates of the RR ...Frank Norris sees two great evils in modern America: the lethargy of the public and the aggression of the trusts. The trusts are exploiting the masses because `they are allowed to do it'.His analysis of the nation is devastating: `They swindle a nation of a hundred million and call it financiering, they levy a blackmail and call it commerce, they corrupt a legislature and call it politics, they bribe a judge and call it law, they prostitute the honor of a state and call it competition.'The overall mentality of the public, the spirit of the West, equals a policy of `after us the deluge': `The miner's instinct of wealth acquired in a simple night prevailed. They had no love for their land. When the land, worn out, would refuse to yield, they would invest their money in something else.'But, astonishingly, for Frank Norris this is all part of nature, `the gigantic engine, the leviathan with a heart of steel, knowing no forgiveness, no tolerance. Men were naught, death was naught, life was naught. Force only existed, force that made the wheat grow. It was the mystery of creation, the stupendous miracle of re-creation.'For him, `falseness dies, injustice and oppression fade. Greed and cruelty, selfishness and inhumanity are short-lived. The individual suffers but the race goes on.' Everything (e.g., the brutal slaughter by the trusts) is for the good! Man perishes, but the wheat remains.Frank Norris forgot that for the wheat to grow human arms are needed. Man is part of nature.`The octopus` is a forceful, naturalistic and brutal novel, with now and then sentimental and melodramatic passages and, in any case, a controversial optimistic and contradictory end.Not to be missed.;1
600480;I like to know the facts of events that come from my viewing of a film.  I don't consider than many films are very factual (they're not usually), but it intrigues me to go find out what really happened.  The story of Khartoum and Gordon was far far far more complicated than I thought!  The movie, again, was more factual than I gave it credit for, but some of the (to me) fascinating events leading to and included in, the British Desert Corp fighting their way to Khartoum to rescue Gordon was something not in the movie, but could probably justify making a movie of all on it's own!  Well written, very informative.  Wonderful read!;1
349647;this book wasn't that bad but i'll admit i wasn't a huge fan of adrian's mostly because of how whiney he is. even at the end of it he seemed like he was waiting for something to go wrong. and he smoked opium. i like dark and mysterious in books and how he had the power and all goes with what i usually like too. but he didnt emprace it he just tried to get rid of it by smoking and drinking or by having sex (which makes no sence since the physical contact makes him see things) but i didnt seem much improvement in his character as the book progressed. i did however like grace a lot. i was also interested in that coldwater guy and lazonby getting together and since nothing happend in this book - hopefully the next. maybe i'll pick it up if i see it but i wont wait around for the rest of the series because i really didnt think this book was a keeper. this was also the only book i have ever noticed so many mistakes in (i'm sure ur reading this and thinking the same of me but i am not a writer and i didnt have this edited lol) i just think this book needed a little more.;1
444795;So this one will take you for a loop.  No not a good one a bad one.  Its full of this boy doesn't like this girl so instead of ending things he decides to cheat on her with another girl. Then first girl finds out via catching them together and decides to get revenge.  Toss in some pill usage, a lot of cheating, and you have this one summed up pretty well.  I tried to read the entire thing but ended sipping to the last few chapters a little past 100 pages.  I just couldn't stand the flat characters anymore.  The main character needed some help like hospital help.  And I can't understand that if everyone INCLUDING her mother knew she had stopped taking her meds. Why not get her the help she needed.  At the start of this book I didnt know what I was getting into. It started out very good but just lost me along the way.  Lilah was very clinging to start and Carter just seems like a pretty boy.So go into this one knowing:Its slowSorta has insta love (Julia had been crushing on Carter for a while but he didnt know she was alive)Third person POV so things are somewhat jumbledPS I can't believe that this is a trilogy;1
30079;This book was wonderful.  I love nothing better than a book that hooks me and reels me in.What a great story - an Olympic level athlete who goes off to serve his country in WW2, survives a plane crash, floats around the Pacific for an unbelievable amount of time, gets captured by the Japanese and is tortured relentlessly from day one.  The prisoner camps were hard to read about, I cannot imagine what the men there went through. Hillenbrand is so thorough, and she doesn't disappoint.  I hope she is almost done with her next book!;1
140981;"Snakes made me read Burma Road. A herpetologist friend urged me to visit Burma but he died of a snakebite, in Burma, before I ever made the journey. Since then I have devoured anything Burma in anticipation of a future trip. Hideyuki Takano's ""The Shore beyond Good and Evil, a report inside Burma's opium kingdom"" and Alan Rabinowitzs' ""Beyond the Last Village: a journey of discovery in Asia's forbidden wilderness"" have proven to be insightful reads. I heard that Donovan Webster had hiked the entire Burma road twice and was writing a book about it, so I pre-ordered it sight unseen.""Burma Road"", as it turned out had nothing to do with Webster's ramblings but was a world war two documentary instead. I am NOT a war buff and nearly returned the book unread. Luckily I started thumbing the pages and became thoroughly engrossed not only with Webster's wonderful ability to turn a phrase but the incredible story that unfolded before me.Inch by inch, foot by miserable foot, Allied forces eek a supply road eastward to free a starving China caught in a Japanese stranglehold. Fighting disease, snakes, snipers and the relentless jungle itself these heroic figures resolutely power onward. Meanwhile, equally valiant warriors wing over ""the hump"" to drop supplies over the Chinese border. During the course of the war over six hundred planes perished in the airlift.""Burma Road"" is a story of tremendous courage, indomitable spirit, and powerful men. At times it is uplifting and at others equally depressing. Humor and good spirits somehow rise to the surface. Webster has given a face to the faceless and a voice to those silenced on the Burma Road. Only someone who actually walked the Burma Road could write in such a convincing style. Tom Clancy buffs will be enthralled by this better than fiction tale.It was such an entirely wonderful read that I just ordered Webster's first book, ""Aftermath"". ""Burma Road"" is a story worth being told and a book worthy of being a movie.";1
4577;"A Dance with Dragons is the fifth novel in the Song of Ice and Fire series and probably the most eagerly-awaited epic fantasy novels in the recent history of the genre. It may be six years since A Feast for Crows was published, but it's eleven since A Storm of Swords came out and the last time we saw new material from Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen or Tyrion Lannister, the arguable central triptych of characters around whom the whole series rotates. The risk is high that Martin would deliver a novel that fails to meet expectations.Fortunately, he succeeds in giving ASoIaF fans a book that is almost everything its predecessor wasn't. Whilst Crows was tightly-focused and constrained in geographic setting, Dragons is huge, epic and sprawling. The novel covers events happening almost five thousand miles apart from one another, with a huge cast of characters, old and new. Where there are new characters, they are there to serve specific plot points and get the storyline really moving along, whilst some major existing characters are simply not featured where they have nothing to contribute to the storyline. Martin employs a fairly strict POV structure this time around: Dany, Jon and Tyrion (and, to a lesser extent, another character) get a significant number of chapters each but everyone else only gets a few. Once their work for the novel is done, they're outta there, and other POVs only show up when needed. This gives the novel a busy, revolving-door feeling at times as characters come in, do what needs to be done, and then get out, and gives some individual storylines and chapters a rather concise, focused feel, despite this being a huge, long book. Certainly with these 'lesser' POVs, there's little to no time for filler, though with some of the bigger POVs there are moments when Martin dwells on a story point a bit too long or delivers bit of background information which, whilst intriguing, doesn't really contribute much to the storyline at hand.It's a busy book with lots happening, possibly more than any other book in the series bar only A Storm of Swords. It's also the most disparate, and the geographic sprawl would make it easy for Martin to lose control of either the timeline or the plot focus. He doesn't do either, and by the end of the novel the timelines have been pretty much re-synched (with plenty of AFFC characters reappearing in the final few chapters to keep everything moving). Thematically, the book is much concerned with the notion of deeds, not words (the term ""Words are wind,"" is oft-repeated, probably a little bit too much) and the notion that you can only know people by what they do, not what they say. Disease and pestilence also play a role, whilst for the military engagements Martin expands his influences to include Napoleon's ill-fated march into Russia. These scenes are vivid enough to make you feel chilly even if you're reading the book on the beach.This series is known for its plot twists, sudden shocks and major character deaths, and Martin doesn't stint here. Some twists are genuinely shocking (though a couple have some carefully-built-in get-out clauses), on the level of the Red Wedding or higher, though others are a bit more predictable, with the author having taken care to lay some groundwork in earlier novels. Other elements come out of nowhere: the resolution of a key, major backstory mystery from the very first novel (probably not the one you're thinking of) is unexpected in both happening with two books still to go, and also in the amount of detail it gives. Another twist is bravely pulled off with almost solely the use of new characters and actually works, throwing almost all of the carefully-constructed fan theories out there for a loop.Characterisation is particularly strong, and Martin seems to relish some descriptive passages. A detailed account of the Doom of Valyria - quite a few books overdue - is spine-crawling and disturbing, whilst another one of Martin's trademark huge feasts may feel over-familiar right up until you realise what's really going on, at which point a belly laugh is the only possible response.A Dance with Dragons is a bleak book. Winter has fallen in all its fury and it really doesn't seem possible for the war-ravaged Seven Kingdoms to survive, with no harvest taken in and little to no supplies put to one side. Some characters are trapped in nightmarish situations whilst others have to be careful with every decision they make lest they trigger chaos and bloodshed. But there are moments of lightness, and the feeling that in the darkness there is still hope for these people and their world.Towards the end, A Dance with Dragons picks up an irresistible momentum which brings us towards what looks like the biggest convergence in the series to date. But, in a misstep that could have been fatal if not handled better, we never quite get to that climax, which seems to have been mostly delayed to the start of The Winds of Winter. Instead Martin breaks off the book on a series of cliffhangers that dwarf anything seen previously, and only a few story threads find any sense of resolution. But we then get a couple of concluding chapters featuring some of the most pivotal and startling moments in the series to date, and the real sense that whatever readers think A Song of Ice and Fire is about, or how it will end, Martin is not necessarily interested in doing the same thing. The ending is impressive, despite the cliffhangers, but brings in a little note of bitter sweetness: waiting a year for The Winds of Winter would be hard enough, but the fact that we know we'll probably have a lot longer is frustrating.A Dance with Dragons (****) solves a lot of the problems experienced in the previous book in the series and brings renewed energy and focus to getting this story towards the endgame. A series of cliffhangers, some over-used terms (though ""Nuncle,"" only gets one airing, thankfully) and a feeling that Martin might be revisiting some plot elements a little too freely dent the book's achievements, but a series of emotionally intense and surprising final chapters restore the faith that Martin has regained control of the story.I am a moderator on the Westeros.org website, the creator and chief admin of the Game of Thrones Wiki and someone who is mentioned in the acknowledgements of the book. Whilst I have tried to have been as honest as possible in my review, you may want to bear those factors in mind.";1
602670;"Eddie O'Kane has a drinking problem and has been know to strike a woman.  His employer, Stanley McCormick, youngest son of Cyrus McCormick, inventor of the reaper, also has a problem with women and hasn't actually seen one in twenty years--not since he attacked a perfect stranger on a train.  This book follows the lives of both men during the course of their association while Stanley is basically incarcerated at a mansion originally built for his sister, who is also mentally ill.  Stanley's behavior runs the gamut from catatonic to unbridled rage.  Over the years, his psychiatric treatment is virtually useless, serving basically as a research instrument for his physicians, until finally a doctor comes along who employs Freud's ""talking cure,"" with mixed results.  Meanwhile, Stanley's long-suffering wife Katherine visits every year but can see Stanley only by clandestinely watching him through binoculars from the mansion grounds.  According to Boyle, she never stops loving Stanley, more for what he could have been than what he actually was, and he was never a husband in the physical sense.  I identified most strongly with Katherine, not only because she's a strong female character, but also because her story is really the most tragic.  However, she doesn't allow her husband's affliction to deter her from finding her own fulfillment through feminist causes such as voting rights and birth control, and fortunately she has the financial resources to pursue these interests.  Boyle never disappoints, and this historical fiction piece is no exception.  At almost 500 pages, though, it requires a bit of a time commitment.";1
299149;Let me just start off by saying that I have the utmost respect for Duff Goldman and his staff at Charm City Cakes. I went to Culinary School and worked in a bakery right after graduation, so I can respect what they do day in and day out. And I only wish I had a fraction of the talent that they do. And after reading this book, everyone can also understand what they go through into making those beautiful, awe inspiring cakes that they produce every day. This is no cookbook. This book goes deep behind the scenes of the show Ace of Cakes. You learn all about Duff, how he got his start and how his crew at Charm City Cakes came to be. The book is filled with excellent photos of the cakes they make and of the staff themselves. And spread out through the book are stories about the staff and how they came to meet Duff. What makes both the book and the television show, Ace of Cakes, so special is that these are not just a group of people working in a bakery every day, doing a job. These are a group of friends that have grown into a close knit family and you can see that they love what they do and it shows in each and every cake that goes out their front door. So if you are a fan of the show or just have an interest in baking I highly recommend this book.;1

He talked of developing characters, his plans to write for a certain number of hours to get the book finished on time, the dramas with pencils he used & sending off his work as he went along.  There were also stories of what was going on at home with visitors, the boys ups & downs & the joy of his family around him.

606824;Lord of the Flies was a well-written book.  I will admit that.  But it was boring for most of the book.  SO you think I contradicted myself?  Okay, it's well written in a sense that it has good language use, and lots of symbols (I seemed to like it more after we talked about it in class for English), but when I was reading it on my own over the summer, I thought it was EXTREMELY boring, and I could not concentrate and would have to read chapters again and again because it was one of those books that your eyes are reading but your brain isn't absorbing.  It only got interesting until (sorry to spoil it), but when people start killing each other, and that was about chapter 10 (out of 12).THIS BOOK was rather DULL but if you like symbols and such then read it for the sake of that, but NOT for ENTERTAINMENT purposes.;1
339505;I enjoy Wally Lamb.  I find he is a wonderful story teller. I always get involved with his characters and his detail and narrative are so great, its almost as is I am watching a movie.

Good job Mr. Lamb.;1

280010;&quot,I guess we're like oil and water.&quot,&quot,I'd say we're more like gasoline and a blowtorch.&quot,This quote from _It Had To Be You_ basically sets the undertone for the whole book.  I love Susan Elizabeth Phillips, and I was thrilled to get my hands on _It Had To Be You_.  I'd heard so many things about her football series that I couldn't wait to read the book that started it all.Pheobe Sommerville just got herself a football team.  After her dog, Pooh, peed on her father's grave, she found out that her father left her his Chicago Stars.  Now, all she has to do is learn what to do with that little ball covered in pig skin called a &quot,football&quot,.  For, even though her father has owned the team for about a decade, Pheobe hasn't come in contact with him for longer then that.  She's been spending her time flouncing around the world and making a name for herself as a sexpot bimbo.  Little does anyone know that behind her curvy body lies an intelligent mind and a wounded soul.Dan Calebow, the Stars coach, has overcome childhood poverty and abuse to become a successful football player and coach.  Needless to say, he is furious that Pheobe inherited the team.  When the two meet, sparks fly, tempers flare, and passions roar as the reader gets ready for the time of her/ his life.  Pheobe learns how to deal with the team as Dan learns how to deal with Pheobe.  And, the two are undeniably attracted to each other.  Can the Stars win the AFC Championship so Pheobe can keep the team?  Will Pheobe and Dan put away their pride so that they can have a love for all time?I really loved _It Had To Be You_ and for many reasons.  When I first met Pheobe, I thought, Oh great, I'll have to read about her for the rest of the book.  But, I quickly saw that she was an amazingly complex character and she goes through a wonderful change through out the book.  Dan is this big chest thumping, beer belching, womanizing chauvanist, and I usually don't like my heroes to be quite this alpha.  But, he is definitely a charmer and as Pheobe fell under his spell, so did I.Susan Elizabeth Phillips is known through out the romance world for her witty, uncanny humor.  It shines in _It Had To Be You_.  Although there are definitely the darker sides to this book, it has such a cornball, smart humor to it that everyone will love it.  Susan Elizabeth Phillips has an amazing talent for romance and humor, a combination that is dynamite.  Not many books can have you laughing in stiches one second and crying your eyes out the next.  _It Had To Be You_ is one of those special few.  So, if you enjoy lovely romance and knock your socks off humor, _It Had To Be You_ is a must read.;1
113377;"I'm a contrary critter. At random moments, never when I can predict their appearance and never when I can guard against them, I will suddenly be beset by a case of the contraries. The very first time I laid eyes on an ad for Alice Walker's, ""There Is a Flower At the Tip of My Nose Smelling Me"", the contraries hit me full-force. Alice Walker's trying her hand at another children's book, eh? I was unimpressed. Oh sure, it looked cool. So do Madonna's books for that matter. It means nothing. So for months and months and months I refused to read the book. There's no explanation for it. I was simply being petulant. Sight unseen I'd made up my mind that I wasn't interested and that, ladies and gentlemen, was that. Such an attitude might suit a hermit living in a cave somewhere, but it is hardly befitting of a children's librarian. It was hard for me to ignore the fact that slowly the roar surrounding Walker's book has grown louder. It's on one best book of the year list.. no, two! No, three! I couldn't stand idly by and let this happen. If I was going to dislike this book, I was at least going to give myself a reason. So I picked it up and read it cover to cover and wouldn't you know it? It's not bad. Not bad at all. Certainly finding the right illustrator was key to the book's success, but nobody can say that Walker hasn't found a topic appealing to child-reader set. It's admittedly not the kind of poem I'd immediately gravitate towards, but I'd be lying to you if I said the book wasn't oddly beautiful. Not a first choice, but certainly a worthy one.A young girl, her face visible only in the lower right-hand corner of the page, sniffs a pale pink bloom. Says the text, ""There is a flower at the tip of my nose smelling me."" Turn the page and now the girl is embedded within a deep black/blue/purple sky. Here eyes are the clouds that float before her face, stars dotted everywhere. ""There is a sky at the end of my eye seeing me."" Working with this inside-out look at the world, the girl goes on to discover rain, dances, oceans, and finally, ""There is a story at the end of my arms telling me!""In her ""Note from the Author"" at the end of the book, Ms. Walker explains how the inspiration for this poem came to her. Basically, she was walking in a forest near her house and ""the wonder of myself as part of all this overcame me. I began to sing: 'I come out of You, my Love. I come out of You!' "". She later remarks that, ""I wrote this book, which was not a book then, but a thank you note."" It wouldn't be too much of a stretch then to interpret this book as a religious meditation on God's wonders. On the other hand, it would be equally easy to see this as an example of personal empowerment. After all, the book is all about me me me. I guess that in addition to creating a book where kids can bend their minds around statements like, ""There is a pen nestled in my hand writing me"", Ms. Walker leaves its spiritual significance wide open. The bookflap of this title describes the poem as a, ""gently provocative text"", which seems like wishful thinking on the publisher's part. Still, there's is definitely an allure here that's hard to pin down.It's a pity that the book doesn't happen to mention how illustrator Stefano Vitale created the art. From what I can tell it may have involved painting directly onto a wooden canvas, but that's just guesswork. Certainly Walker's poem is quite nice. Kid-friendly and simple, but with just the right hint of something deeper involved. Still, it's not hard to imagine what could have happened had her words been paired with a less than stellar artist. Some might have taken her story and filled it with pastel puppy dogs, bubbles, and butterflies. Someone else might have gone the opposite direction and gone all mod on us. Maybe this would have been all adult-centered three-toned shades of brown and the occasional representational object for kicks affair. Vitale's strength with this book is that he's willing to make his work both child-friendly AND easy on the eyes. His images jump close to his subject matter, as with the picture of a sunrise where we can make out a quarter of the girl's face, prominent and striking, on almost half a page. Mr. Vitale is currently a resident of Venice, and perhaps his attachment to that particular city is at work in this book. The girl's masklike (though by no means unemotional) face, the colors, the sinuous use of line, etc. all give the book a distinctly European air. Or maybe I'm just saying that because I know where Mr. Vitale currently makes his home. Dunno. All I can say for sure is that if Mr. Vitale were to turn his image of the girl blending in with the indigo-hued night sky into a poster, he'd be set for life.I'm a sucker for simplified openings. For example, you pick up this book and you open the front cover. The endpapers are just a shaded rainbow spectrum, continuous and unblemished. You turn the page. Here too is the image we saw on the cover on our left. Below it are two small dedications. On the right is the title page. After that the story starts, and all the remaining publication info is squeezed into the back of the book. There's nothing like a little good design to help a title of this type along.It's still not my favorite book of the year, but that can't really be attributed to anything but personal preference. Alice Walker's latest hits all the right notes and is a thoughtful piece as well. Worth your time and consideration.";1

124369;Mary Karr has a charming, light style of writing and a good grasp of the dramatic.  Unfortunately, she never seems to gain any real insight into her issues in this memoir-- I found her descriptions of her substance abuse to be pretty superficial and her conversion to Catholicism even more so.  Clearly, she is desperate for the certainty that the faith provides, but she never seems to see this about herself. Instead, she presents herself as converted by repeated proofs of prayer-That is she asks and god delivers- in the form of cars, cash and success.  Her need to uncritically reduce faith to some sort of pray order delivery service- both demeans Catholicism and makes her come off as infantile.;1
352696;"*****""A historical approach is greatly illuminating. Language comes alive in its context. ... Thus a historical approach makes Christian language relative and not absolute."" Marcus Borg, Speaking ChristianThe early Church Fathers followed primarily one of two methods of interpretation: Allegorical (spiritual) or literal. Going beyond literalism, Origen advanced allegorical Bible exegesis, early in the third century, claiming that it hides the truth from those blinded by sin and pride, while revealing it to the renewed eyes of believers. Up to the Reformation, the Bible was not usually interpreted in a strictly literal way.Marcus Borg, who pursued the search for the real historical Jesus, with the Jesus Seminar for the first decade of its work, now exposits an alternative understanding by restoring authentic biblical meanings. Dr. Borg believes Christian language needs to be set free from its contemporary literalism. He wrote some of the most thought provoking books of which Speaking Christian is the most recent. His vision, as he stated, ""I think we're living in a time of transition within Christianity that's been going on for half a century... where what I call the common Christianity that most Christians ...took for granted is no longer persuasive and compelling.""Some Biblical historians believe that Biblical literalism came about with Sola Scriptura, at the rise of Protestantism. So, Dr. Borg coaches the reader, with the book conclusion, asking if literal interpretation was part of the foundation he would like to shake, in the words of Paul Tillich, one of the century's most influential Christian thinkers. The author now persuades you into a discussion, helping you recover true belief. While the questions are his, some answers are expected from you, in the early Christian Catechetical school tradition. How important has the promise of heaven, or the threat of hell been influential to your Christian experience. How was your interpretation of the Bible, driven by the 'Framework of Heaven / Hell' concept within Christianity. How central were sin and forgiveness to adulthood faith, and how central are they for some forms of Christianity?In a recent interview the Bible scholar revealed that the turning point of his search for God, confessing that was his most formative religious insight, came in a series of mystical experiences. ""They changed my understanding of the meaning of the word 'God'-of what that word points to-and gave me an unshakable conviction that God (or the sacred) is real and can be experienced. These experiences also convinced me that mystical forms of Christianity are true, and that the mystical forms of all the enduring religions of the world are true.""Borg's liberation using a historical approach, which promotes a relative Christian language in understanding the creation, the flood, and the ten plagues goes beyond refuting literalism, to reconsider gender equality, same sex relations, and at its core to review the Christian doctrine of salvation as its only venue.";1
132187;Leonard once told a reviewer with The Strand magazine that he never begins with an outline of his literary creations.  First, Leonard selects a setting,  then he creates a group of colorful characters, colors in those characters with unique traits, memories, and abilities...and finally, he allows those characters to interact and take the story to the conclusion. Never has this process been more evident than with Up In Honey's Room. The setting is unique. The characters are interesting. The plot? It winds inexorably and sometimes painfully to its conclusion.  This book is an opportunity lost: Leonard goes through the motions, but the result is totally unfulfilling.;1

93846;"Clayton M. Christensen is a professor at the Harvard Business School. In the Innovator's Dilemma, he presents his research into business life cycles and how larger companies find it difficult to innovate. He shows how these larger companies eventually are replaced by innovators who make inroads by taking the bottom markets willing ceded to them by the bigger companies. Little by little, the smaller companies eat away until they have market dominance themselves, leaving the once market leader without a place to go.The concept of how small companies can thrive in a world dominated by large companies is an interesting one, especially for the entrepreneurs facing Goliath. Christensen lays out several test cases where the larger company couldn't innovate, allowing smaller companies to enter at the bottom of the market. He even shows how and why it made sense for the management of these dominant companies to allow this to happen - at the time. Innovation is not an easy prospect for large companies because their large existing customer base often will not allow the innovations to move forward because it doesn't fit their needs. Innovations often bring a different customer and large companies are not always able to choose to service both.Christensen provides a few examples of this phenomena in excruciating detail, studying the rapidly changing industries of disk drives and steel production. He rounds out the book with a discussion of the steam shovel and how it lost out to hydraulics. In a final case study, he examines how the principles could be applied to a potential disruptive technology - the electric car. He lays out a complete game plan for a company to take the innovations available and capture a new market. Sadly, in the years since publication in 1997, it doesn't appear anyone has taken up the challenge, although perhaps Tesla Motors has come the closest.The problem I have with Christensen's book is his writing style. He is definitely a Harvard Business School professor. He delves deeply into his research, explaining every nuance of the industry in such detail as to leave no doubt he has done an extensive study. I grew up in IT, living just miles away from one of the great innovators of the disk drive industry, yet I learned many things about  disk drives. I hadn't imagined I could get a technical education from a book on business management.Christensen's writing style was the biggest barrier to the material. His explanations were too deeply steeped with details that didn't move the story forward. While the datum was valid and important, it didn't necessarily have to be presented in long, exhaustive detail. Today's readers do not have a lot of time or desire to spend long stretches of deep explanation. I found it necessary to spend at least 45 minutes reading before getting ""into"" the book. I couldn't help comparing the style to that of Jim Collins inGreat by Choice. Yes, Collins is also a researcher who loves detail. The difference is that Collins moves all his detailed explanations to the appendix where those who desire it can find it. The book itself is organized into fast moving, short chapters laying out the salient points distilled from the exhaustive research. I would really have appreciated this approach in this book by Christensen. Collins is a storyteller where Christensen is a Harvard professor.Christensen's insight is worth the slog through the knee deep data. Just be ready with a canteen for dry stretches of endless detail as far as the eye can see.";1

123255;The first time I read Lost Horizon, was in the summer of my sophomore high school year, for a reading requirement. I didn't think I would enjoy any of the other books on the list: The Red Badge of Courage, The Old Man And The Sea, A Tale Of Two Cities. That was literature, and I learned that literature meant alot of beautiful passages, finely crafted human emotions but all terribly and painfully boring. Lost Horizon was going to be another preachy epic, about the human condition.I was wrong.Turned out I consumed the novel in two afternoons with my 16-year old adolescent mind. I was lost in a world, where a woman stayed beautiful for ninety years, a land protected as secret from society, an eden.Bangkok is attacked and four passangers find themselves on a plane, being evacuated from the burning city. Barnar - a mysterious american with oil fields in north, Miss Brinklow - a dellusioned missionary who thinks she can convert anyone to christianity, Mallinson a british youth and Conway the adored hero of the novel.They find themselves abducted into paradise, where no one grows old, where wars can't find their way over high peaks, where the vanity of the world stops, and art masterpieces and books are hid away from a 'dying world'.The only way back to the rest of the world is to wait for porters that come into Shangri-La and trade goods. The problem is the porters have no regule schedule, they may show up next month or next year. Mallinson the youth, misses his girlfriend left back in london and his family. He's anxious to get back and watches the other comrades daze into a fatefull sleep, earning to stay in Sri-Lanking, the perfect paradise.Conway is 38. He's tired after the war, with no real purpose in life. He thinks about settling down and Sri-Lanka is the perfect place.Barnar has other reasons to stay. A bit sinister, but who can blame him to leave paradise? It's his perfect escape from his crimes and the punishment that awaits him on the outside.Miss Brinklow views the settlement as a perfect mission ground where she can convert the 'non-believers' to christianity.The day of escape comes and Mallinson finds he's the only one trying to leave.I've read the Lost Horizon this week. Four years later and I've never grown out of it. It's still just as good, literature mixed with thriller, page turner, and rivaling modern bestsellers.Enjoy your summer. Pick up this read.;1

614974;The Neverending Story is a book that anyone can enjoy, regardless of age and gender. It was better than I expected it to be and it's packed full of important themes. How Michael Ende came up with a great story like this  truly boggles the mind. I've seen the movie and liked it, but the book  explained what the real meaning of its' title. The only gripe that I had  with it were some of the character descriptions, some of them seemed rather  corny, either the product of Ende's intent or Manheim's translations. Other  than that, I consider this novel a first rate fantasy. Anyone, I think, who  reads it, will definetly think about Ende's thoughts that he expressed in  his book. It is clear that Michael wrote an entertaining fantasy, but he  also wanted the reader to think. The Neverending Story is about Bastion, a  depressed boy who dosen't seem to like himself too much. When he discoveres  that the land of imaginations' existence depends on his actions, he is  afraid and wonders what the Childlike Empress could want out of a anti-hero  such as himself. When he does save Fantasia, he becomes not only it's  savior, but also a supreme being. But his new-found powers make him very  vunerable to HIMSELF?  Read the book to see what I mean. The Neverending  Story is a book that its' readers won't forget for a long time, if ever.;1

215387;Funny. There seems to be a Law of Nature that fantasy and science fiction series descend rapidly in quality after the first few books. Terry Pratchett is a notable exception to this rule. The first few Discworld books are a pleasant enough way to spend an afternoon. The later books are considerably more than that. In them Pratchett's characters have deepened and the engrossing storyline is only the top layer of the book. This is one of the best of the Discworld books I've read (my favorite so far is Monstrous Regiment). I'm sure both that I'll be rereading it and that I'll be pick up subtleties I missed this time around.;1
532900;In the American Southwest, an elderly man lies dying beside a deserted road when two tourists pick him up and take him to a small town hospital. Once there, the emergency room physician does an MRI. She finds something even stranger than the way the old man's clothing appears cut apart and mismatched back together: his insides look that way, too. Soon he's dead, but not before babbling words and phrases that make local law enforcement mightily curious. &quot,Quantum foam. Makes me roam.&quot,Meanwhile, far away in France, scholars dig in the ruins of a &quot,Dark Ages&quot, fortress and town discreetly bought up by the U.S. corporation for which the dead old man (a noted physicist) worked. The professor supervising both dig and graduate assistant staff disappears. As they puzzle over his absence, his students discover a note in his handwriting. &quot,Help me,&quot, it says. A note on parchment, and in ink, from the time whose artifacts they're uncovering.Meticulous in both its historical detail and its scientific speculation, this pulse-pounding, plot-twisting thriller held my interest from first word to last. My only criticism (as always seems to be the case for me with this author) is that for all the time I spent with his characters, I didn't get to know them very well.Which won't stop me from buying another Crichton novel soon.

465669;I am a sucker for anything that has Clan in the title, I love those highlanders as they lord over the Scottish lands.  This is an enjoyable story about betrayal, loss and renewed love.Macrath Sinclair and Virginia were in love and as soon as she could convince her father, they were going to marry.  Unfortunately her father was not going to let her marry a man from the highlands who is without a title.  Instead her father marries her to an older man with health problems that took his anger out on those around him.  He dies less than a year later and leaves his wife, mother and sister, penniless.In order to survive, Virginia needs an heir and she knows just the man who could help her.  She travels to Scotland and is welcome with some reservations by Macrath but he forgives her and they spend some wonderful nights together.  Yet she still leaves him.  He goes off to Australia with his invention, an ice machine that preserves food and returns a year later to find London in turmoil because of Small Pox.When he hears Virginia is sick he goes to visit only to find out he has a son, without hesitation he whisks his son back to Scotland, and that is when the battle begins.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and as this is the first in the series, look forward to reading more.  I had such feelings for Macrath, as he is first hurt when she marries without telling him why, then when she comes for help she does not tell him her problems and of course the worst one is when she withholds his son from him.  He just pulls at your heartstrings.I know Virginia had her issues, she did not want to be forced to marry and when she is free she does not go to Macrath with her heart, instead she deceives him.  I know she did not have many choices but I wish she could have confided in him.  I did like the chemistry between them and thought they fit well together.  Both of them were stubborn and strong willed which is probably why it took them so long to forgive and find the happiness they deserve.I will definitely be continuing the series and look forward to more.Copy from publisher through Edelweiss for an honest review;1
535435;I read the first 75% of the novel with disdain, and most of it was directed at the two protagonists of the novel, Lin and Manna.  I've never read any main characters as passive, stupid, and pathetic.  I don't know if Ha Jin was trying to generate sympathy for the characters, but it didn't work for me.  Like I said before, I looked down on the characters--most of their misfortunes were self-inflicted, whether from Lin's arranged marriage to his dumb wife or their pointless &quot,waiting&quot, itself.  And I didn't buy for a New York minute that Lin would keep on going back to his wife for a divorce once a year for 18 years without thinking of trying something else, I mean, how dumb can a guy be?So . . . going into the final quarter of the novel, I expected a total cliched tragic ending.  A lot of these Chinese books and movies always go for this, like Joan Chen's witless movie Xiu Xiu.  However, Ha Jin does something interesting, and the ending surprised me.  Far from being cliched, it was quite original and utterly believable and realistic.  Ha Jin shows what reality is:  that no matter how sad the people and their situation, life goes on.  Sad people generally do not commit suicide or die of cancer when it's convenient for the plot.  As such, I applaud this novel.;1

Now a silent partner for &#8220,Hard Ink Tattoo&#8221, with is brother, Jeremy, Nick has had a rough year living with the guilt and pain. To make matters worse, now he continues to see the beautiful blue eyes in his mind of the woman he turned away and refused to help.The only family she has left, her brother Charlie, has gone missing. With only a few short words that he left in a message, Becca feels she is grasping at straws to find someone or something that will lead her to find him. Desperate, she turns to the only name she has for help, Rixey. Unknowingly stepping into the world of one of the very men that her father ruined and destroyed, Becca soon learns that she could also hold the key to help find the clues needed to clear his name and his team brothers.It is so exciting for me to share my thoughts about this book.

She is such a talented author and never falls short of achieving another excellent read for her fans. I am so in love with this story and characters, there is no doubt in my mind that there will be several  (much anticipated) installments to come.

248073;"By the time the killer was revealed in ""A Test of Wills,"" Charles Todd's debut mystery with shell-shocked Inspector Ian Rutledge in charge, I had pretty much stopped caring ""whodunit.""  The identity is indeed a suprise, and a good one at that, but I found getting there an extremely hard slog.  Perhaps it's the polite Edwardian sensibility of the characters, perhaps Todd just isn't that skilled a writer, but the pace is glacial, and the presence of Hamish MacLeod, the ghost in Rutledge's head, while initially a unique plot device, for me quickly became a tiresome intrusion.  And Todd doesn't quite, psychologically speaking, blow the lid off of British repression as much as he and his publicity machine would have us believe.  More people than not have flipped over this mystery series, however, so you might give it a shot.  But it's far from the taut, crackling good yarns of a Ruth Rendell or a P.D. James.  I'd even reread an old Agatha Christie before continuing with the Rutledge mysteries.";1
176962;That is just one of the great lines from this work which is poetic in the sense that it strives toward essences rather than fullness. I thought it was one of the the best take on post-9/11 America that I have read and captures perfectly the dilemma faced by today's professional army....they are in it for various reasons ranging from genuine patriotism to simple employment prospects but the folks back home (having learned from Vietnam) treat them with a thoughtless respect which paradoxically turns into a kind of contempt because it is not based on anything real understanding of the war or the oft spoken of 'shared sacrifice.' The author may never be invited back to Texas but the journey he takes us on is unforgettable.BLLHW lacks the philosophical depth of Catch-22 but as a satire on Americana circa 2013 it can't be beat.;1

319606;"No, I'm not planning on taking up a new activity that would likely land me in the hospital within a week (if not sooner).  But I *do* find the videos of parkour fascinating.  When I saw the book The Parkour and Freerunning Handbook by Dan Edwardes show up at my local library, I figured it was worth a quick read just to find out more about the sport.  This is the perfect book for someone curious about parkour and how practitioners are able to leap and dive over obstacles with ease.  And if you were actually interested in getting started, there's enough information here to learn the basics while getting a solid grounding in how to keep from killing yourself in the process.I think what surprised me most is that its really more of a philosophy and life attitude, akin to something you might find within the martial arts.  It combines play, lifestyle, discipline, and methodology.  Those who are serious about parkour start to view it as the foundation of all movement, the ability to flow with the environment and use the body to overcome barriers that normally block our paths.  I can easily see how it could become the basis of an entire fitness regimen, as it combines strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular activities into a single sport.  That's probably why the videos you see of parkour always seem to have people who look incredibly fit and ripped.The Parkour and Freerunning Handbook was a quick read for what I was looking to get out of it, and it will change the way I view parkour videos from here on out.  The ""wow"" factor will remain, but it will also be joined by a solid appreciation of what it takes to get to that level.Disclosure:Obtained From: LibraryPayment: Borrowed";1

457113;"Erastus Carthage leads the Carthage Institute of Cellular Seeking (see a problem?) and his institute has developed techniques for resurrecting krill deep frozen in ""hard ice"".  There has been success, but the krill only live for the briefest of time, then their metabolisms accelerate and they die. An expedition into Arctic waters is collecting more krill when they find a frozen body. The frozen body is taken back to the lab, and an effort to resurrect the man begins. What follows is well-written and well-presented and the characters start out being well-drawn. The question then is, what is this book about? Carthage is a bully-type leader but brilliant, and he has a brilliant team under him. Is it about character decay and hubris? Is it about back-stabbing? Jeremiah Rice, the frozen man is resurrected, and we have a man from 100 years ago viewing the modern world. Is it a comedy of manners? Then, almost three quarters the way through, we ask, is it a romance? It is a bit of each of them, but that gives a real problem with bringing the story to a proper ending, and I was dissatisfied.If all you want is a soft and doomed romance that ends with heart-strings pulled, then this book might be worth five stars, but if you want the characters to act in character, it is disappointing, instead they act more as soggy cardboard. It is difficult to explain without spoiling the ending, but here are some examples that hopefully show the problem but do not serously affect the story. Before trying the resurrection, shouldn't someone make the point that they should sort out the issue of why the krill die before proceeding? Rice has been in ice for a century, so some more time in the freezer is hardly detrimental. When things start going wrong, Carthage has to give a press conference to defend himself. He finds the ink has run on his lecture notes and he cannot read them. (Lecture-note laundering!) He then goes into a funk. Come off it. The man is described as Nobel-prize quality, so surely he would be able to speak without notes. The behaviour of the scientists does not relate to who they are supposed to be or how they start out, wimps do not reach the top of their field. Even the romance does not make sense, you love someone, you expect them to die soon, so wouldn't you (a PhD) make some effort to see if they could be treated? There are a number of stories here, and most of them are wrapped up in a final chapter, sometimes with less than a paragraph devoted to it. Now it is fair that some have to be put to one side, but I felt that with such powerful themes, the last half should have had more bangs, far fewer whimpers and much less self-pity.Ian J Miller - author of ""A Face on Cydonia""";1

85837;"The tale of Avery James' search for her mother begins beautifully with: ""The first time I saw my mother was the night she died. The second time was at a party in Santa Fe."" From that moment on you are captivated. Indeed the first part of the book, in which Avery accidentally discovers a portrait of a woman who is her spitting image, is very appealing. However, before Avery can discover the truth about her mother, Hendricks whisks us away into Avery's past. She spends the next third of the book describing Avery's abandonment in the furnace room of a home for foundlings, her unhappy childhood, her even unhappier youth. It is not until the last third of the book that Avery returns to the ""present"" and solves the mystery of her mother's life - and untimely death.The main problem with this book is that it doesn't live up to the promise of its first lines. Isabel's Daughter is supposed to be the story of the emotional transformation of a young woman. However, Avery simply remains angry throughout the book. At first she's an angry child who doesn't fit in, then she's an angry teenager who gets into fights, then she's an angry young woman whose fear of abandonment leads her to reject the ones she most loves. Frankly, the theme is overplayed. Avery doesn't show enough variety of emotion to make her a believable or sympathetic character. She simply comes across as irritating, in the manner of a temperamental teen. At the end of the book when Avery supposedly has her emotional epiphany, there is no basis for it. Consequently, the sudden transformation falls flat.The other theme which Hendricks doesn't pull off is Avery's obsession with her mother. In the last few pages Avery states that she has wondered about her mother every day of her life. Yet, throughout the book, Avery gives her mother scarcely a thought. We can assume she was angry over being abandoned, but it is too much of a stretch to imagine Avery has actually spent her life searching for her mother when there is no evidence for it. In fact, quite the opposite. When she finally discovers who her mother was (the beautiful artist Isabel) she does not show the slightest bit of curiosity. She does not call the man who was her fiance, even though he gives her his number,in fact she does not ask a single question about her mother until page 263.At that point in the book, the story fizzles completely. The old lady with whom Avery's enigmatic mother once lived says that Isabel was killed by the man who loved her. That intriguing revelation should have led to something - anything. But, like much of the rest of the story, it went nowhere. The ""mystery"" is never resolved in a satisfactory manner. Nor was the relationship between Isabel's former lover, the handsome Paul DeGraf, and Avery, Isabel's look-alike daughter. That plot line simply screamed ""Rebecca"" or some such twisted, strange, moody affair, but it remained as uneventful and monochromatic as the rest of the story. Like all of the other relationships Avery gets into, it is resolved by her throwing an almost stereotypical adolescent temper tantrum.There are numerous logical inconsistencies in the book which also serve to muddy the waters. Avery's mother is stunning and Avery's resemblance to her is said to be ""amazing."" Yet, Avery is not stunning, at least there is no mention of it, and whereas some people are shocked at the ""amazing"" resemblance, others don't seem to notice it at all. Avery understands Spanish, at times. But needs it explained to her at other times. She has been taught to cook Southwestern style, but pulls off a French dinner for twelve on the basis of reading a Julia Child cookbook. (Anyone who has attempted same, can attest to the fact that Julia will not turn you into a French chef overnight.) Avery is supposed to have the ""gift of sight"" (inherited through three generations of curanderas), but very little is made of it, certainly not enough to be convincing.The logical inconsistencies, the flatness of the characters, and the general muddiness of the plot make for a very choppy storyline. Worst of all, Hendricks completely misses moments which are supposed to be dramatic high points - Avery's discovery of her mother's identity, Avery's ""grand entrance"" (wearing her mother's dress) during a party held by Paul DeGraf, Avery's confrontation with the only man she has truly loved (or was supposed to have loved). Although the flow of the writing is very smooth, the events feel completely contrived. The end, in which everything works out in a thoroughly predictable fashion, is simply dull.";1

Was there only so much alcohol and drugs that Mimi, the international slut, could do without killing herself? And what about Dana, the so prudish she must belong to a cult, virgin, sleeping with Adam? Were they really just sleeping? Did you make too much of Alexis and her revenge motive with Vanessa against Callie? Wasn't Clint really just too perfect?

On the other hand, the  The Martian Chronicles sounds like a post-modern mythology. And that is what make the stories eternal: ""myth, seen in mirrors, incapable of being touched, stays on"" to quote the author.I have not much to say but praise the literary value of the book.Yet the 5 star rating is only for the literary merit of the book and not the censored reprint --- a crucial drawback indeed as the new editions of the book lacks one of the episodes  (namely ""Way in the Middle of the Air"", as one can read in the older versions., e.g. in The Martian Chronicles, the Bentham paperback, 1975, p 89 f). The episode has been removed by the new publishers altogether!However, a summary of each episode can be found in Wikipedia including that of the eliminated episode which specifically deals with racial prejudices (and ironically that is the very reason that it has been kicked out by the brilliant new publishers not to offend certain readers in the commercial market!). The summary of the missing episode is as follows:____________________________Way in the Middle of the Air-----------------------------""In an unnamed Southern town, a group of white men learn that all African Americans are planning to emigrate to Mars. Samuel Teece, a racist white man, decries their departure as a flood of African Americans passes his hardware store. He tries to stop one man, Belter, from leaving due to an old debt, but others quickly take up a collection on his behalf to pay it off. Next he tries to detain Silly, a younger man who works for him, saying that he signed a contract and must honor it. As Silly protests, claiming that he never signed it, Teece's grandfather volunteers to take his place. Several of Teece's friends stand up to him and intimidate him into letting Silly depart.As Silly drives off, he yells to Teece, ""What you goin' to do nights?"" - referring to Teece's nightly activities with a gang that had terrorized and lynched blacks in the area. The enraged Teece and his grandfather give chase in their car, but soon find the road cluttered with the discarded belongings of the rocket passengers. After they return to the hardware store, Teece refuses to watch as the rockets lift off. Wondering how he and his friends will spend their nights from now on, he takes a small triumph in the fact that Silly always addressed him as ""Mister"" even as he was leaving.This episode is a depiction of racial prejudice in America. However, it was eliminated from the [1997 Avon Books/ reprinted in] 2006 William Morrow/Harper Collins [= Harper Perennial Modern Classics], and the 2001 DoubleDay Science Fiction reprinting of The Martian Chronicles.""(Wikipedia)";1

281306;"I can only dream about experiencing the kind of adventures Bradford Washburn has had. The excitement, the discoveries, the surprises, the dangers.While my outdoor adventures are limited to hiking already discovered trails I do adore true stories of those who have foraged new trails, scaled peaks of the highest mountains, explored untouched territory, and risked life and limb to do so. David Roberts has allowed me to experience wilderness and mountain adventures along with Bradford Washburn, at least in my mind, as he took me to the edge where the earth meets the sky.I could feel the cold, the fear, the pain, the hunger, the joy, sensing the danger, and the exhilaration that come with such daring adventures. Roberts has the uncanny ability to describe things so well I could swear he was running a video feed through my brain.""The Last of His Kind"" is something an armchair wilderness and mountain explorer, like me, must read. I am left wishing I could scale Everest, K2, and all those other impressive towering peaks. When my good friend and I scale those much smaller mountains, via already forged and well worn trails, we always ask each other, ""Where are OUR Sherpas?""As I finished the book I was left saying, ""Wow!""";1
547875;I found this book to be totally relevant to life (whether lived today or in ancient time).

177106;Seventeen years ago, Chlo&eacute, was adopted by a happily married young couple.Nine years ago, when she was in third grade, Chlo&eacute, befriended a quiet, sad boy named Rock. She comforted him, he challenged her to a race across the playground. They've been racing (and challenging each other) ever since.Seven years ago, Chlo&eacute, spent the summer helping her uncle Seth fix up a motorcycle. They poured their blood, sweat, and oil into it. They named her Lolita.Five months and nineteen days ago, Uncle Seth died.Now it's the day after winter break, and Chlo&eacute,'s counting down the five months left in the school year. Before summer break arrives, she will ride, scream, cry, fall in love, find freedom on the road, seek solace at the dock, and try to bring up her chemistry grade.Gaby Triana's latest novel, Riding the Universe, is her best yet. Chlo&eacute, Rodriguez is a strong, stubborn girl who confronts her struggles - be they with science, boys, or machines - head-on. Though she rarely says them out loud, she often combines words in her mind to describe a feeling she's having, like awkwardity and stellacular. (Woo hoo for portmanteaus!)Chlo&eacute, surprises herself when she falls for her tutor, Gordon Spudinka. At the same time, she feels like there's something going on with her best friend Rock, something that's making them drift apart. Meanwhile, she becomes closer to Gordon, and her priorities shift.The topics of grief, adoption, and identity are handled subtly, and they are handled well. The fact that she was adopted doesn't really matter to Chlo&eacute,, she loves her twin brothers, whom her mother gave birth to the previous year, and she never thinks of Mama and Papi as anything less than her parents. Only recently has she begun thinking about her birth parents and blood relatives. She gets worried when considering medical scenarios: what she would do if she someday needed a blood transfusion like Seth did? Who could help her then?Each character in Chlo&eacute,'s world has a distinct voice and presence. Her kind, careful mom is obsessed with astrology while her daughter prefers astronomy. Affectionate Rock often teases his closest friend, but when he's serious, he means every word he says. Gentle Papi, a fisherman for the local seafood market, is described so well on the first page of the book that one can see him instantly. Chlo&eacute,'s parents got married when they were twenty-one years old, and they are still very much in love. Meanwhile, Rock's mom moved away to be with her boyfriend right before he met Chlo&eacute,. In his teen years, Rock shed his shyness and became a serial dater. Chlo&eacute, often disapproves of the girls he dates, and she's reluctant to admit that could be because she's jealous, or that she knows that Rock likes her as more than a friend.There are plenty of bumps in the road of life, along with twists and turns one may not see coming. Riding the Universe handles the curves very well, making for a memorable journey through Florida City.;1
249323;"This book was a recommend for those who love the works of Patricia Briggs, Kim Harrison, Carrie Vaughn, Ilona Andrews, etc...so, since I had just discovered Andrews - I had high hopes for this series. My first thought was that the characters are unlikeable. I believed they would grow on me, but I was sadly mistaken. The author sets up her ""world"" and explains all of the main character's ""hangups"" and ""handicaps"" in an elementary style in the first chapter...then repeats it over and over in an annoying whiney tone of ""oh woe is me"". The story is never believable, the plot is non existant, the characters feel like actors in a bad pilot where no one knows how to interact with each other. The dialogue is stilted and it feels like the author picked up a pen and started just writing about a dream she had - no rhyme or reason. The sudden addition of ghosts and ghouls is ridiculous and never fully explored. I've never read a book where I hate all the characters. Here is my first. I find it supreme sacriledge that this mess is favorably compared to the wonderful delights of the authors I mentioned in my first sentence. If you want to be gripped within the first words - read any of those authors. Ilona Andrews, in particular, is outstanding. Stay far away from this author.";1

590500;Decades ago, the main drag of Monterey, CA was lined with canneries which would pack sardines brought in by fishing boats. In the mid 1940s, the yearly yield began to dramatically decline and in 1973, the last cannery went out of business. The street was renamed &quot,Cannery Row&quot, after the title of this novel. Now, Monterey is a trendy tourist spot but, after reading this novel, I can picture the Monterey of years ago. In fact, I grew up in such a village on the east coast called &quot,Greenport&quot, on the eastern end of Long Island. Greenport evolved from a fishing town to a resort area too.In my mind's eye, I can see the colorful characters Steinbeck created frequenting the streets of Monterey. Indeed, many of the characters were based upon real people. The colorful madam of the town's house of prostitution, Dora Flood, was based on an actual person named Flora Woods. The biologist &quot,Doc,&quot, who ran a biological supply shop which supplied animals to labs, was based upon Steinbeck's actual close friend. Steinbeck treats these characters with affection. For the most part, they are oddballs and misfits but, on Cannery Row, they manage to fit in perfectly. They belong there and the personalities of these colorful individuals mesh perfectly. Oh sure, there are conflicts and trouble but, all in all, everything works out.The book is lighthearted. After being a WWII war correspondant, Steinbeck gave the soldiers something funny to read. At times the book is poignant and at other times, it is almost slapstick as some of the characters find themselves in situations which would do justice to the Three Stooges. Where else but in this community can a prisoner in the local jail get furloughed for a day since the prisoner has influence to deliver votes to the sheriff in the next election? Where else can a married couple live happily in a large, abandoned boiler located in a vacant lot on Cannery Row?Interestingly, none of the action takes place in a cannery. The only references to the canneries are when one of the characters needs a job for a couple of months and takes one at a cannery. Somehow, with little money and sporadic work, everyone seems to survive in flophouses, boilers, pipes or wherever else they can mooch their way through life and they are happy with their lots in life. Yes, it's a fantasy but it's a beautifully written, descriptive one. It is a fine work of literature that I heartily recommend.;1

580950;"I re-read this every few years and each time I get something new out of it.  I've read many of Coetzee's other books, and while I've liked them all, none of them have resonated with me the way this one does.  This book is particularly relevant to post-911 America. The political and security paranoia reflected in the character of Colonel Joll and his vague mission to protect a frontier town from the perceived threat of the ""Barbarians"" -- a threat that never manifests itself -- is obviously reminiscent of our own country's experience over the past decade.  It's not so much that some level of paranoia isn't justified.  I don't think that's Coetzee's point.  The novel instead explores how the unbridled entertainment of such paranoia can undermine the very society people seek to protect.  Coetzee's language is poetic and powerful.  The themes are obviously relvent to and reflective of his own South Africa in the 1970s when the novel was written, but they truly are universal.  I find the book mesmerizing, lyrical, and disturbing.";1

248549;"I often get rambunctious boys who dominate the classroom. This book can be used by a teacher to chill the homes.American readers will be offput by its British Empire Fun Fair tone but I teach in a former colony.We need not trash ""the politically correct"" to like this book. It adds and does not detract from the feminist conversation because, ""oppression of girls"" should not create a new oppression of the high spirits, the rambunctiousness, the courage, and the instinctive sense of honour of boys.Use this book to get the lads on parade. If they are tossing chip butties about the classroom, enter roaring right you lot, slam this book upon the desk, open it up and in a loud voice read to them right, today we shall learn to hunt, and kill, and eat a rabbit with a gun.This may be done with gun in hand in many American towns, but it is best to leave the gun at home elsewhere.The girls need not feel left out for there is a fundamental asymmetry between the reactions of girls to a book marked for boys, and of boys to a book marked for girls: for girls, as a section of the book tells us in appropriate language, are mysterious and full of fancy lights on the inside, and it is well for the lad to enter what the Freud chap called the latency phase. Whereas girls have a necessary interest in the outside world of moors, and rabbits and the sea.As it is, in the US and the UK, altogether too many boys are being railroaded towards Prison Planet by an overgentrified educational system, that reflects no true ""political correctness"", if we understand ""political correctness"" to be the code of the person who, like the Victorian ideal gentleman, would not harm others unnecessarily and only seeks to generalize this for the modern world, but instead a disgustingly middle class silence on the realities of life.";1
20719;"I just read Teacher Man, four years after it was published because my mother e-mailed and said it was a ""must read."" She and I met Frank McCourt years back when he was signing books (Angela's Ashes) at a BJs in Waltham, Mass. He sat there, seemingly unflapped by a long queue of admirers, completely focused on the person with him at the moment, unbothered by requests for photos. When it was our turn, I thought he was simply gracious. I liked Teacher Man immensely, and found it to be entertaining, honest and at times both funny and quite meaningful. I also enjoyed getting suggestions for reading books and authors I've missed along the way (Santayana for one). McCourt doesn't explicitly state this, but it comes across: ultimately, the teacher decides what happens in h/her classroom. And McCourt's classrooms provided rich experiences for his students because of what I would call his ""inspired creativeness."" (He also had the ability to take the ball -- no matter what ball he was passed -- and run with it.) He managed to tie English structure and grammar, (which can be deadly) vocabulary and writing into what interested his students, creating student-centered lessons long before it was the pedagogical rage. I loved his account of student's enthusiasm for recipes and how they added music and turned them into songs and raps. I loved how the students all brought an ethnic dish and shared them with each other and anyone passing by on the streets of New York. McCourt was a conductor who brought out the best in his players by getting them to relate to each other and to him. But, all is not always well in Teacher Land (and here's where McCourt's honesty was especially appreciated): the low pay, fatigue, and sometimes impossible task of pleasing parents and administrators are not omitted. Another book well written, Mr. McCourt. Kudos!";1
463271;For 100 pages The Kept had me turning page after page.  The story taking shape was dark and mysterious.  There were new bits of information that were dribbled in, pulling me along.  When the main characters set out on their quest, the story entered a seemingly endless loop of backstory and context setting, a second novel, really.  The author is not terribly successful using flashbacks to tie the two story lines together.Such promise in the first third was simply thrown away with the change in setting.  Time is spent reading about characters who end up doing almost nothing advance the main story.  By the end it looked like the book would get interesting again.Unfortunately, bringing the cast together didn't save this work.  The ending was a rush job, and perhaps was satisfying only to the author.;1
9868;The Other Boleyn Girl is a compelling story and it is easy to see why it is so successful. I felt caught up in the court life during Henry VIII's reign. My biggest problem is the heavy-handed treatment of the characters - Anne Boleyn is too ruthless and ambitious, Mary is just too good, Henry is one-dimensional.  The history license taken is considerable but not surprising given the premium placed on writing a juicy tale.In spite of books shortcomings, I enjoyed this as a guilty pleasure. I will probably check out other works by Gregory from my local library. I would rather spend my money on books by writers like Roberta Gellis or Sharon Kay Penman because they write higher quality historical romances.;1

270708;This is an interesting story of the global conspiracy at the highest level kind. Of course this sort of tale can never be that convincing due to the near impossibility of keeping things secret with so many people involved. However, it is worth suspending disbelief since the main tenets of the plot are quite clever and it is well told.The main protagonist, Bobby Hart, is a little too good and a little too lucky to completely ring true, but he is an interesting and clearly multi talented character. The extent and objectives of the conspiracy gradually emerge, and there are close parallels with Caesar and the Roman Empire and the effects of his crossing of the Rubicon, which is the code name for this plan.I thought the first half of the book was better than the second as, once the conspiracy was out in the open the conclusion was fairly predictable at least in broad terms. However it was a story which was well thought out and which I enjoyed.;1

74064;The voice of the perky, inquisitive, acutely observant Scout Finch from age 6 to 9 captures the reader so strongly as to hold together a whole string of disparate episodes &#8212, originally conceived by the author as separate short stories. Mainly, we get to know various characters of a poor little Alabama town during the Depression, their peculiar rituals and class and racial prejudices, and their sometimes redeeming acts of generosity. In this, it is more like Mark Twain's Adventures of Tom Sawyer, another child's-eye view of a southern small town told as a series of anecdotes, than like Twain's later and more tightly structured Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.Scout's most piquant observations of hypocrisy, neurosis, arrogance, or cowardice are of the white folks she knows best. But she also reports with fascination the courage and kindness of a few individuals, including especially her father Atticus Finch, a neighbor woman, Maudie, and the Finches' black maid Calpurnia. A particularly beautiful moment is Scout's visit with Calpurnia to her First Purchase AME Church, a revelation to this protected white girl of black devotion and dignity and a whole community close by but separate from the little white hamlet.The book is best remembered for one episode that is expanded to extend over several chapters and which is a pleasing, though historically misleading fable: the trial of a black laborer accused of rape of a poor white woman, and his defense by Scout's father Atticus. Sadly, nothing like the judicial fairness of the Maycomb judge, the opportunity of the defendant to legal defense and serious cross-examination of the plaintiff ever happened or could happen in Alabama in the 1930s in a black-on-white rape case. What Harper Lee evidently had in mind when she wrote it was the famous Scottsboro Boys trial in 1933, where no such judicial niceties occurred. But there were defense attorneys &#8212, mostly northerners &#8212, who, a bit like Atticus Finch in the novel, made the effort, often at the risk of their own lives.But it is the voice that saves this and all the stories in the book. You have to love this tomboy when she tells you in a hurt voice that, when she tried to hold her big brother back from some dangerous adventure, &#34,Jem told me I was being a girl&#8230,&#34, Or when she observes, back in her white church, &#34,the Impurity of Women doctrine that seemed to preoccupy all clergymen.&#34,;1

424915;"What is it that generally seals the deal for you when you're reading a post-apocalyptic or dystopian read? Do you strive to find that eerie feeling of inevitability that comes with the concept that the post-apocalyptic world you're experiencing through pages is one that you could possibly experience in real life? Or do you not care about the authenticity of the world and whether or not it is reasonable for our world today to reach the havoc to the point of the world in the novel? Where all you're really looking for is a quick and chilling read to pass some time, perhaps with a little, ""What if?"" lingering in the back of your mind?I am the former type of post-apocalyptic/dystopian reader. As odd as it may sound, I love feeling so horrified that the complete and utter cataclysm presented to me in a fiction post-apocalyptic could possibly be a reality at some point in the future. That thrill of, ""What if this actually happens?"" adds such an inexpressible and thrilling ambience that immerses me into the novel more than anything else could be able to, and from then on I imagine that it's not only the characters in the novel fighting for their life in the post-apocalyptic, dystopian barren wasteland, but also me.And that is why In the After is such a remarkable read for me. Although I may not have found the particular alien scenario to be one I see happening, Lunetta crafted her world in such a way that I couldn't help but picture myself in the world and have myself experiencing the apocalypse along with the characters. The novel itself does undeniably have some issues concerning pacing and the dystopian world represented in the latter half of the novel, which left me feeling rather detached at select times, but for the vast majority of the novel, In the After was nothing short of a thrill-ride for me, wherein I was experiencing every single occurrence in the novel along with the characters themselves.The first quarter of In the After firmly establishes the of electrifying and wild world that is the After. Throughout some of the beginning of In the After we follow Amy as she finds herself one day dealing with the trivial things of everyday life in the Before, whether those actions are looked upon by Amy in flashbacks or dealt by her in the present, to her scavenging for food and struggling to survive in the harsh world overrun by the monsters--Florae--that have ravaged practically everything she once knew and loved from the Before. The juxtaposition of these two vastly different perspectives from the Before and the After made a huge impact on me and my reading experience as I started the novel, and I soon found myself thrust into the dangerous world of In the After along with Amy.As well as that, character and relationship development takes center stage in In the After alongside the horror and suspense that accompanies the Florae. Similarly to T. Michael Martin's The End Games, In the After features a strong central, family relationship between Amy and Baby. However, I have to say I like the relationship between Amy and Baby in In the After more than the one between Michael and Patrick in The End Games for a few reasons, one being that Amy and Baby aren't directly related, but look to each other as sisters, and another reason being that I feel the relationship between Amy and Baby is met with much more depth and poignancy than Michael and Patrick's.Lunetta's use of silence and its key role throughout most of the former half of the novel, as well as how Lunetta used silence to depict her world is both effective and downright chilling, and the placement of a touching relationship in a crude world brought out a brilliant and breathtaking contrast throughout the novel. Although there were quite a few parts that dragged as the somewhat dystopian society of the novel was introduced, In the After redeemed itself with surprising twists and thus I am able to say that, shocking, thrilling, suspenseful, and smart, In the After is an exceptionally impressive debut from Demitria Lunetta, and I have trouble thinking of a better and more exciting read to start off the summer.";1
364598;This was my first venture w/this series by the author and I might have benefitted from reading the four previous novels involving Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro as some of the interplay between them alluded to previous matters. My first Lehane experience was Mystic River which, in my opinion, is a stand alone classic. This is a different breed of cat, but an interesting one, nonetheless.Kenzie has helped a young woman who claimed that a man from her gym was stalking her and that he had in fact trashed her car. This matter is easily set right by Kenzie and his side-kick and protector, Bubba Rogowski. A few months later the young lady jumps naked from the 24th story of the Custom House Tower in Boston. Kenzie feels some moral responsibility to look in to the matter as he had neglected to return a call from the woman before heading of to Bermuda with a tempoary romantic interest and when he got back he had forgotten to call.His looking into the matter sets him on a chilling course of events which are better read than described here. Kenzie/Gennaro/Rodowski make a formidable and somewhat entertaining team, although some of the diologue and situations strain credulity a bit. All in all, a read that you will enjoy and be reluctant to put down until the rather twisted ending is revealed.;1
527564;"This book is really boring. Unfortunately, I must read it. Since it is not an enjoyable read, it could at least be a little shorter. The information is not presented in as efficient or condensed of a form as it could be.On a personal level, I don't like this book because it has a bias in favor of abstract and nonobjective art. Barnett Newman, Covenant, 1949 is pictured in the book. It is a red background with one vertical black stripe and one vertical yellow stripe. The book calls this type of art, ""extremely large scale, unified color fields of personally conceived shapes or signs concerned primarily with provoking sensations of ritual, human tragedy, mythology and the like."" Really? Cuz I call it a waste of paint. I mean come on...the ""painting"" is a canvas painted one color with two vertical stripes. It doesn't ""provoke"" anything in me except disgust that anyone would call that art. I have a shirt with vertical stripes on it. You know what that shirt represents? Wait for it: Yeah, it is a shirt with damned vertical stripes, that is it. No more, no less--not a deep reference to human tragedy and the like. Sometimes these poser artistes really need to get over themselves.Have you ever watched a movie where some pompous, overly coiffed ivory tower types walk through an art gallery eating finger food and looking at complete garbage called ""art"" while discussing the deep meaning and artistic qualities of the garbage they are looking at? And you look at the art and think, the five year old next door could have produced that. Well, those hoity-toity, artsy-fartsy types are the authors of this book.If you are like them, the book may be more to your liking. I personally do not like most abstract and nonobjective art. The book is full of snide snips to the effect that if you fail to appreciate abstract art, then you aren't apparently a deep thinker or your sense of art is shallow. Here's a few examples.""When an observer's expectation is of literal work, the intended  content of the artist is often misinterpreted."" In other words, if you fail to appreciate some garbage that could have been painted by an eight year old, then it is necessarily your fault because you just were incapable of understanding the ""art.""""Artists who are more concerned with responses than with commonplace perceptions are legitimately called conceptual because they are idea-oriented and thus more creative."" Oh, so if you paint something real, then you didn't have an idea in your head but if you paint nothing recognizable, then you had some amazing idea in your head. Uh, who says? In other words, if someone throws paint at a canvas with an idea in their head, then they are more creative than somebody who attempts to paint something recognizable. Uh, yeah. Whatever.";1

42086;"This is not a difficult read at all.  The book is simple and straight forward.  Tom Macauley gives us a tenderhearted look at what it was like to be 12 years old in Belfast and looking for any type of work that might give you spending money.Being a paperboy was the best thing available for a young man.  His brother had done it as well as many others in the area they lived.  The problems were not so much the delivery of the paper as it was with collected the Friday night pay from your clients and then making it back to your ""boss"" with the money without being robbed by other young boys in the neighborhood.But along with that simple story comes all the background material that makes this an interesting read and a nostalgic look back on life in the 1970's.  For an American reading this story it is amazing to me that life in Belfast in 1975 was really not much different from life in the United States in 1975.  The same TV shows, the same foul language, the same bullying issues and all a kid wants to do is have a paper route and make a little money.This is a fun read with nothing shocking, it just reminds you of the past.  If your a younger reader you will enjoy this ""historical"" look at the world that I grew up in as well as the young Mr. Macauley.Enjoy!";1
24993;"""Fragment"" is the perfect novel, it is destined to be the #1 best-seller of the Summer.  I can not praise it enough.  The prologue sets the stage for impending doom, it describes true life species, such as the Chinese Northern snakehead fish, that have been removed from their natural habitats and are destroying the wildlife of the ecosystems into which they are introduced.The actual novel begins with the discovery of Henders Island in 1791.  Located 1,400 miles from the nearest land mass, it has remained isolated for centuries.  Captain Henders sends a boat to the island to retrieve water, a crew member is attacked and killed by a creature described as a ""red devil.""  In the present, the cast and crew of a reality show lands on the island and are slaughtered within minutes by strange, biological creatures.  Soon the United States Navy surrounds the island, scientists are sent in to investigate this new ecosystem.""Fragment"" is a great blend of science fiction, action and suspense with strong elements of horror, romance and fantasy.  So excited was I after reading the first one-hundred pages that I began telling all my co-workers and friends about it.  ""This is going to be the best-selling novel of the Summer,"" I told them.  Then I briefly described the plot.  ""Do you think they'll make a movie?"" they always asked.  ""I hope so!"" would be my response.Perhaps the author, Warren Fahy, will be filling the void that was created by Michael Crichton's death.  ""Fragment"" has been compared to ""Jurassic Park.""  However, there are no dinosaurs on Henders Island.  Instead, these creatures have evolved differently from anything in our world.  They are perfect killing, feeding, breeding machines.  Their reproductive rate is extremely high because their mortality rate is high.  Nothing from our world can survive more than a few minutes on Henders island.  All creatures are a bizarre combination of mammal and crustacean.  They have numerous legs like insects, numerous eyes, multiple stomachs, and air tubes that go directly to their legs to keep them moving.  They are born pregnant.  Babies mate within the womb.This novel is an easy read despite the tremendous amount of biological jargon that is used.  (Biology was one of my favorite subjects in high school.)  It reads like non-fiction and is extremely interesting.  The characters are well drawn.  There are some, like Dr. Nell Duckworth and Dr. Geoffrey Binswanger, who are very likeable, you will cheer for them as they race against time to flee the island.  Dr. Thatcher Redmond, on the other hand, is one of the most evil, vile characters I've ever read about in a novel.If you read only one novel this Summer, ""Fragment"" should be the one.  It is highly recommended for all fans of science fiction, adventure and horror.  If you like Michael Crichton's ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World,"" you will want to read ""Fragment.""  It is destined for the big screen.  It is destined to become a classic.  And I pray that someone, perhaps Steven Spielberg, makes a film based upon it.";1

133119;This is the second work in 'Outcast' series, and we see Torak out to sea and on the small island just off the mainland. How can book two be so driven and vivid? this is just another great piece children's fiction - that said, I dare any adult to try and stop reading or listening to this work, the audio CDs are very well read by Ian McKellen with his added gravitas, his voice lends real magic to the saga.;1
32652;This novel is essentially the story of three college students graduating from Brown in 1982, Madeleine, Leonard, and Mitchell - all of them brainy and passionate, who, instead of devising realistic plans for the future, essentially stumble their way through life in the next year. Madeleine, daughter of a small college president, attractive, and fit, is enamored of Victorian romantic novelists but attends classes that deconstruct many of the truisms to which she subscribes. It is in such a class that she meets Leonard, a charismatic, rather unkempt, renegade. She is hooked, much to the dismay of Mitchell.To say that Madeleine's next year with Leonard is troubled is an understatement. He has a brilliant future in biology, but that is assuming that he is well - he is not. He is a manic-depressive. Contending with Leonard's manias is difficult, but nothing compared to dealing with his depression. No doubt, some of these scenarios will hit home with some readers.Neither the characters nor the story are particularly compelling. The supporting characters are weak. Madeleine and Leonard seem interesting at first, but become ever more awkward, headed nowhere. Mitchell is a lost soul.;1

The illustrations show a jungle growing around him in his silly white costume and his adventure begins as he tames the Wild Things.

349197;It can be intimidating to swim against the current or to voice a contrarian view, but I'll follow the advice of Kevin Hall and step out of my comfort zone.With such an overwhelming number of five star ratings for ASPIRE my expectations were especially lofty. As I read this book I experienced moments of motivation, inspiration, and retrospection. And yet when I finished the final pages, there was no resounding WOW echoing in my mind or sounding from my lips.I enjoyed reading ASPIRE and especially enjoyed reading about the experiences of so many interesting people who have crossed the path of the author. The lives of these remarkable and courageous people give one pause and cause one to examine one's own life and contemplate how he or she can imitate the methods and successes of the impressive role models presented.However, there's not much here that I haven't read or thought about before. What's nice about this book is that it causes long recessed or latent thoughts and concepts to rise to the surface and seem fresh and new. Having studied Latin and Greek myself for more years that most people I wasn't as impressed by the etymological examinations of words as many others would be. In fact I found some of the verbal disections a bit far-fetched and drawn out.Aspire is a good book and a pleasant read. It's thought-provoking, motivational, and inspirational. Yet for me the experience of reading it was not life altering. Instead of turning on lights for me, ASPIRE made them brighter so I can see a little more clearly the path I have already chosen.;1
388515;Eveby Anna CareyEver since Eve was a little girl, she has lived in the School.  A place where she is taught, fed, and promised that one day she will become something.  Something grand.  All the girls before her, had gone on to be something better.  Doctors, artists, teachers, things that she too dreams of.  She can't wait to decorate the world with her paintings.  She can't wait to make an impact.But, on the night before her graduation from School as the Valedvictorian.. things change.A girl named Arden tells her the truth.  What [i]really[/i] happens to the graduates of the School.  There are no better jobs that await.  There is no further learning.  They leave.. go into the building across the lake, and never come back out.  Stubborn, Eve goes to find out if Arden is correct and to her horror finds things..she never expected.Now, she has to get out.But the outside world is harsh.  The plague wiped out over half the population and the 'vaccine' didn't help.  Now there is no electricity, no gas, no stores and restaurants.  They are rebuilding the world under the rule of the King.  A man that took power in the chaos and has yet to let it go.  The problem is, he has a plan for everyone.  Even girls like Eve.She meets Caleb, and she knows that boys and men are bad.  They want one thing and one thing only.  To ruin a woman's life.  But despite her best efforts she finds herself warming and traveling with  him.  Hoping to find a safe haven.  On the run from the government, can she survive?I've been wanting to read this book for a while.  I'm a massive dystopian fantasy fan and this is another one that I will add to my bookshelf of Awesome.  At first, I thought that the character was a little flat.  Wide-eyed and innocent, and a bit too goody goody for my taste.  But what I loved about the book, the author, and the character, was .. she didn't stay that way very long.Outside the school, Eve finds herself in ways that she never thought possible.  Learning new ways to survive, to be, to exist.  She finds ways to become stronger, to change, and to be a woman in her own right.Caleb, the male protangist, is the kind of guy that is rough around the edges.  He too is an escapee from a government function that uses and abuses Orphans.  He and a group of boys are doing their best to carve out a place in the world for them.The only thing I thought.. was a little off about the book was the romance.  I loved the romance actually, it just seemed that the only reason they were together was because he was the male lead and she was the female lead.  I just.. didn't feel like there was a build up to the connection they later had.  Rather it just slammed home instantly, and kept right on going.Not to say it doesn't happen.  It's just .. it felt odd when Eve was told growing up that she should never trust, touch, or ever be around a boy.  That they do nothing but ruin your life.  Get you pregnant, lead you on, ruin your life.  So I just thought it was odd how fast she jumped on board.Overall though, I thought it was a fantastic book and I can't wait to get my hands on the sequel.4 stars;1

360151;"I reviewed this book for Romance Reader At Heart.RRAH's THOUGHTS AND PONDERINGS:The first anthology from these amazing ladies, IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT was so good that I was eagerly awaiting their second endeavor with IT HAPPENED ONE SEASON. With the exception of Ms. D'Alessandro, all the other authors are on my keeper shelf, and I had very high expectations, which, I have to be honest, were met.As the blurb states, this book offers four different stories with the same plot line. All four of the heroes are military men, while our heroines are wallflowers and have been firmly `on the shelf'. Since this is an anthology, I've decided to read `Fate Strikes a Bargain' first, then from there on I went to `Only Love', followed by `The Seduction of Sebastian Trantor', leaving `Hope Springs Eternal' for last, as I'm not familiar with the author. As of right now, I intend to correct that fact and familiarize myself with said author because I truly loved her contribution to this book.In `Fate Strikes a Bargain', Candice Hern gives us Nathaniel Beckwith and Phillippa Reynolds.  They meet while both are in hiding from the throng at a ball. It doesn't take Nat long to realize that this charming, if not dazzling, woman is all that he needs in a wife, so he proposes to her on the spot, even after she tells him of her disability, a pronounced limp. And while they strike a bargain, it's a bit more difficult convincing their respective families to go along with them, so they agree to court for the remainder of the Season, just to appease their family.I loved these two, and I wished the story was longer so that we'd learn more of Nat and his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Philippa's coping with her disability. However, for a short story, Ms. Hern has yet outdone herself. I thoroughly enjoyed this well told, warm and compelling love story.Mary Balogh's `Only Love' was so good, it made me cry. Our hero in this tale is Major Jack Gilchrist, and our heroine Cleo Pritchard, a war widow of unremarkable looks. Both are surprised and delighted to encounter each other at a ball as they've had a previous encounter long ago. Cleo's husband was his commanding officer, and Jack was the one to break the sad news of her husband's passing. During that brief moment of despair, they shared a kiss, which neither ever forgot.Jack, aware that he has to wed as soon as possible, decides to propose to her the day after the ball.Our heroine, being a practical person, has some doubts, so she proposes a counter offer of her own to our hero. She'll accept his proposal on one condition only: if, by the end of the Season, it's proven that she can conceive and give him an heir.What's a man to do when given such a proposal? Read this sweet love story in which Ms. Balogh's superb writing held me spellbound from the beginning to the end.`The Seduction of Sebastian Trantor' was Stephanie Laurens' turn in introducing us to her own war hero, Sebastian Trantor, code breaker during the wars.  As with the other hero's, Sebastian must marry posthaste to prevent his cousin ""Mad Freddie"" from inheriting.Tabitha Makepeace has a mystery to solve in order to capture a blackmailer. Nothing will deter this young lady, not even a locked door of a library at a ball she's attending. And that's how she comes face-to-face with our hero, who is himself hiding in the same library. Since the evidence she uncovers is in code, Sebastian offers her his services, but they get discovered, and in order to save her reputation, Sebastian proposes to her on the spot and in front of witnesses. Both are in accord and are planning to use their sham of `betrothal' as cover while in hot pursuit of the bad guys.As usual, Ms. Laurens' heroine is sharp and witty, and we get drawn into a story of mystery and intrigue while rooting for our hero as he tries to convince his lady love that she's the perfect wife material for him.And now we come to the last story, `Hope Springs Eternal' by Jacquie D'Alessandro.Captain Alec Trentwell is a man on a mission to tell the truth of the death of Edward Markham, our heroine's brother. He was her brother's commander, and eaten with guilt, feels that in voicing the truth and his part in it, he will be set free. What our hero's not counting on is the lust that he begins to feel towards our unassuming heroine.Penelope Markham is on a verge of destitution as she finds herself fired from her governess position.  She's also an aspiring artist, with no prospects in sight because of a scandal that happened in Italy as she attempted to sculpt a nude of a man. This is where our hero Alec comes in and attempts to come clean, but instead, guilt and attraction kicks in, so he offers her a commission to paint his portrait instead. That same night, however, while attending a ball in his honor, our hero feels compelled to offer for her hand, and she accepts.I loved the way this story developed, and I fell in love with Ms. D'Alessandro's writing. Every page was filled with feeling, and you just couldn't help but be drawn to Alec and Penelope's tale of conflict and true love.While we found all four couples share the same fate, we're given four unique stories of happily-ever-after that were well-written and compelling. All four couples were very likeable, and I would be hard-pressed to choose a favorite one. I liked them all equally.Each tale was well-written with three-dimensional characters, steady pacing, and I found them each unique in their own way. All of them could well stand on their own, and I would have gladly read them if they each had a book of their own.Melanie";1
576227;We hate yuppy scum, we hate phonies and fakers, we hate school, infact we don't really care too much for anything if we're at all synonymous with the wonderful, original teenage slacker that is Holden Caulfield. In one of the  shortest novels I have ever read, JD Salinger manages to grip me in a  constant state of shared anguish, shared adolescent humour, and the kind of  hobo longing suggestive of the Kerouac style. To say this is one of the  greatest books ever is simply not good enough. There aren't enough stars in  the universe to give Salinger for this work. Such honesty, such gallant  disenchantment, such ponderous misanthropy, such a tongue in his cheek and  such a wonderful story.;1
10002;A different take on the story of Anne Boleyn, this novel is told by her overlooked sister, Mary, who was Henry VIII's mistress before he became besotted with Anne. Gregory uses modern language and expressions in her writing, so this novel does not drag a modern reader through a field of Thees and Thous, which IS more historically accurate, but frankly I am not interested in reading a novel that I have to translate. Lots of sexy court plotting and intrigue make this a page-turner perfect for beach reading or a rainy weekend, but I'm afraid serious history buffs will not appreciate the modern take on the story.;1

145504;"It seems like all we hear in the news lately is about outsourcing, the stripping away of defined benefit and retirement plans, and that there are no further opportunities to be found in business unless you are one of the lucky few at the top of a multinational corporation. In the face of such constant bad news, this book is a breath of fresh air.Alpha Dogs is a result of a quest to find small businesses who have survived at least 10 years and have developed a strong reputation in their communities. This book is a series of case studies on some small businesses whose special qualities helped differentiate them from their competitors, whether it was a new Wal-Mart or a similar small business across town.For example, you'll read about Dorothy Lane, a Dayton, Ohio grocer that became an upscale grocer modeled after Whole Foods that fought off an assault by Walmart when that chain began to operate grocery stores there in the early 1990's. The owner has succeeded by being committed to service - he once personally went to bone  a leg of lamb at 11:30 at night for a panicked customer who thought she had bought a boneless leg and needed to put it in the oven that night - and also committing to his employees by having 90% of the managers home-grown and having full-time jobs filled by part-timers.You'll also read about Auction Systems, which uses databases to ferret out relevant customer information. For example, if customers participated in a coin auction, then the staff will call those customers to remind them of upcoming events involving coins. The owner added an audio feed to her website and found that the average time on the site doubled and that site registration grew 416%. For many customers the audio feed made the auction entertainment, so that the business grew into an online community which is what the founder had always envisioned.Zane's Cycles is an example of ""seducing the customer"". Also in competition with Walmart, they offer 90 day price protection, and a 30 day return policy regardless of bike's condition. In 2004 ten returned their bikes and upgraded to more expensive models. Some used bikes were sold at discount, but the owner figures they pay for themselves in good will. Once, a customer wanted to rent a couple of mountain bikes for the weekend. Instead, Zane's let them borrow them for free. The customer, an organizational consultant, was so impressed with Zane's generosity that he donated a team training session for Zane's employees. Chasing the quick buck would have gotten the owner $200. Instead he got $1500 to $2000 in free training.Amy's Ice Creams is an example of staking a hometown claim, deciding to concentrate in Austin and resist expansion into other cities despite the inroads of national chains into their ""turf"". Amy's distinguishes itself by its sense of fun and theatre and also by being a good local citizen. For example, one store locks in lingering patrons at closing time and makes them all dance ""The Time Warp"" from the Rocky Horror Picture Show before letting them out. As a result, people will come in at closing just to be part of this. The owner also sponsors one community event a week - whether it be a blood drive, donating ice-cream to an elementary school fundraiser, or sponsoring a charity race. This generates positive buzz and good-will toward the company.I really found this book very inspirational by showing that the creativity and innovation in America's businesses still start small even now in the 21st century, and that if you are creative, smart, and persistent, with an eye out for customer service you can succeed. Highly recommended.";1
162934;Lisa Scottoline never disappoints.  I enjoy reading her Bennie Rosato novels, but a stand alone is good for a change of pace.  I really enjoy the characters that Lisa creates.  Nat Greco comes across as a real person as does her family.  Being born and raised in Philadelphia, Nat's family really resonates with me.

426103;You need to be in a good place in your own life before you begin this book.  It is an unrelenting downer of a story, filled with loss, abuse, separation and degradation.I have given it 3 stars because the writing is professional.  Tan develops characters and plot and keeps the story moving.  It's where the story goes that is the problem.The book opens when its protagonist, Violet, is an 8-year-old in her mother's first class courtesan house in Shanghai in the early 1900s. A series of events and some mysteries end with Violet's being abandoned in Shanghai when her mother sails to San Francisco without her.  Violet is kidnapped and sold to another courtesan house.There follows one of the most unpleasant chapters of the entire book - an account of how to please a man and retain his affections so that he will continue to pay for you.  Lest you think this is titillating, let me assure you it errs rather on the side of clinicalism - and fairly disgusting clinicalism at that.  I was willing to accept for purposes of the story that an older practicioner would instruct a younger.  But this goes on for pages and pages and pages.  Why did Tan include this?  Perhaps she ran into some Chinese instruction book for courtesans and wanted to add to the realism and sense of doom in the novel?Violet falls in love with a customer, is disappointed and betrayed, becomes hardened, lives several years as a courtesan and then descends further down the slope of unpleasantness when she marries a deceiver and is transported to rural China.There she is beaten and abused, and finally escapes via murder.The book then abruptly shifts to the voice of her mother, Lucia when she was a young girl in San Francisco in the. It recounts how she fell in love with Violet's father, followed him to China, bore him 2 children, lost her son to kidnapping by the father's family, and then decided to open the courtesan house we have encountered in the first part of the book.  Once again a young woman is used, betrayed and succumbs to a life of degradation and exploitation - both as exploiter and exploited.I am not going to finish this  It is entirely too upsetting and depressing.  I've flipped through the final pages and will not reveal the ending here, but knowing what happens is not enough to cause me to be willing to spend any more time at all in this utterly depressing place.I have enjoyed all of Tan's other books, and many of them recounted sad and deplorable circumstances, loss and human weakness.  This one had a different tone to it - one I very much disliked.;1

292096;"""Inventing George Washington"" by Edward G. Lengel is a thoroughly engaging account of America's perplexing and ever-changing relationship with its iconic Founding Father. Mr. Lengel brings new understanding to American politics, art and culture by sharing how Washington's life story has been widely interpreted by various individuals, interest groups and causes. Intended to be read by a wide audience, Mr. Lengel's fascinating book accomplishes the goal of bringing a measure of fun into the sometimes stuffy genre of Washington studies.Mr. Lengel explains that mythmaking has served to reconcile the tension between Washington's closely-guarded private life and his meticulously cultivated public image. Mr. Lengel recounts how successful writers such as Parson Weems, George Lippard, Caroline Matilda Kirkland, James Thomas Flexner, William Woodward and Caroline Ellis catered to public expectations by producing both praiseworthy and debunking stories about Washington's many perceived or invented personas, from the astute statesman to the fearless warrior, romantic lady's man, pious servant of God, and so on. Within the discussion, Mr. Lengel samples short snippets from some of these texts to reveal fascinating and frequently humorous insights into the authors and their audiences from the 1700s to the present day, if not about Washington himself.To his credit, Mr. Lengel takes aim at some of the most persistent Washington myths that continue to haunt us in the present day. Unfortunately, a number of televangelists and politicians have used the media to spread bogus Christian-propagandist Washington legends and quotes far and wide. Mr. Lengel, who is editor in chief of the Washington Papers project, sets the record straight: the reality is that the authentic writings that survive portray a Washington who had at best an ambiguous relationship with the Christian faith, nor did Washington do many of the things that modern-day evangelicals might have wished him to do (for more on this topic, seeMoral Minority: Our Skeptical Founding Fathers).Mr. Lengel goes on to discuss many other intriguing aspects of the Washington legacy in Americana, including the crassness of the 'Washington slept here' tourist trade, P.T. Barnum's unscrupulous Washington nanny traveling show, the historic preservation movement, the Venus slave child story, the politics of gun ownership, and more. Not to be outdone, Mr. Lengel shares his own story about working as a consultant on the Mt. Vernon welcome center project where he frantically tried to mediate the relationship between the film's spectacle-minded producers and the earnest historic interpreters. Reflecting on the experience, Mr. Lengel finds inspiration in the work performed by the practically unpaid extras on the set who are dedicated to an authentic historic recreation of pivotal events in Washington's life. But while Mr. Lengel might modestly credit these actors with performing a higher service than historians like himself, he need not worry: Mr. Lengel's exceptionally well-written book succeeds brilliantly inasmuch as it rekindles our interest in Washington and America.I highly recommend this book to everyone.";1
278841;"Dick Morris is one of a kind and I enjoyed this book. That said, it probably started out as a culmination of many great columns written by him bundled together to make a book. In the process, some substandard filler material was added. I don't doubt what he says about the left wing/PC agenda, but parts of it are so over the top even for me.In particular, when detailing the corrosive effect of liberal influences on the American culture, Dick mentioned movies made which he categorized as pandering smoking to kids. If a movie geared towards kids showed people smoking, he surmises that smoking is deliberately promoted to children. Problem is, his list of films includes PG-13 and even R rated movies.By no stretch of the imagination should an R rated movie be seen as meant for children. For example, he lists ""Walk The Line"" as one of the movies of 2005 which shows people smoking therefore panders smoking to kids. ""Walk The Line"" is a movie about the true life of country legend Johnny Cash. Since much of the storyline was set in the 1960s, a time where many people smoked (egad, even indoors!), it of course shows people smoking (duh). How else should the story of real people living their lives as they really did - as smokers - be told? How do we tell a war story without soldiers smoking? Or a cops and robbers flick without scenes of drug use? And as with all R-rated films, children were not the intended audience.Though I'm with him on the overall premise of the book, Dick went further than he really had to here. There is so much evidence of the left wing influence and its corrosive effect on American culture that stretches of credibility like his movie hit-list are completely unnecessary. Other than that, good book and a worthwhile read from a unique conservative commentator.";1

317995;"Paul Rudnick is the celebrated writer of novels, plays (Jeffrey), and screenplays (In & Out, Sister Act, Addams Family Values), I Shudder is his first collection.  If you enjoy David Sedaris and Dan Savage, you're going to love this, one of the funniest damn books I've ever read.This isn't just one of those collections of ""funny stories"" about my wacky family.  Rudnick has had a fabulous career, he knows everyone who's anyone, and has the supreme talent to report his observations honestly and without cynicism, which doesn't mean he can't deliver a sharp barb or bitter jab.  Included here are tales of working (whoring) in Hollywood as a screenwriter and script-doctor.  He writes lovingly about tyrannical out producer Scott Rudin, Bette Midler and Debbie Reynolds.  There is a truly unflattering portrait of egomaniacal actor Nicol Williamson's crazy antics on stage and off during the run of Rudnick's I Hate Hamlet.  There are fictional (?) diary entries interspersed by the deliciously droll (and homicidal) Elyot Vionnet (which are quite cynical and depraved).  Throughout the volume Rudnick harkens back to his New Jersey family.  Oh, yes, he is adept at highlighting their many foibles and eccentricities.  However, what comes through in generous amounts is the genuine sense of love, and tolerance (if not out right acceptance) they all have for one another.Rudnick is funny, very funny, and is every bit the raconteur that Sedaris and Savage are.  I've had a pretty dreadful month (the death of both my father and a close friend), and I Shutter came right at the right moment for me, uplifting my spirits, inducing broad smiles and much, much laughter, just what the doctor prescribed.";1

376556;Jaxon Montgomery kept herself isolated from all others, being careful not to make friends or spend too much time with anyone else.  She was trained as a Navy SEAL and is now a police officer, confident in her abilities and well able to protect herself - except from her stepfather.  When Jaxx told others that her stepfather had murdered her Navy SEAL father to marry her mother, she was laughed at and no one believed her.  But then they found the brutally slaughtered bodies of Jaxx's younger brother and fragile mother and a few started to believe.  When her stepfather returned to kill the family who adopted her, the family of another Navy SEAL, Jaxx refused to endanger anyone else and kept to herself.  She feared that anyone else that she showed affection to would be murdered, but she didn't want to be alone...Lucian was the most powerful of the Carpathians - and the most ancient.  For thousands of years he has walked the earth, hunting vampires and protecting the innocent.  He even pretended to be a vampire for hundreds of years so that his twin, Gabriel (Dark Legend), would hunt him and not turn vampire.  The only thing that kept him from meeting the dawn was the thought that his life mate was out there somewhere, waiting for him...Jaxx was not at all what Lucian had envisioned in his life mate.  Carpathian women are tall, slender with raven hair and jewel bright eyes, Jaxx is short with short blonde hair and a spunky attitude.  Sparks definitely fly when Lucian carries Jaxx off to the safety of his mansion, telling all of her acquaintances that he is her fiance.  Jaxx fears Lucian, but, deep in her heart, she knows that she can trust him.  However, she also knows that her stepfather will start hunting Lucian if he doesn't let her go soon and she cannot bear to have another person killed on her account.  She tries her best to protect Lucian, but he doesn't seem to understand the danger.  Lucian is not sure what to make of Jaxx.  He is the most powerful of his kind and it is almost laughable that this little human thinks she can protect him from anything.  Both sides will have to adjust their thinking as they fall deeper and deeper in love and Jaxx comes to terms with being a Carpathian life mate!I loved Lucian as a character.  We last saw him in Dark Legend where he tried to end his life rather than face an eternity alone, but he was persuaded to live because his life mate was out there and needed him.  And if anyone needed a dark hero more, it is Jaxx Montgomery.  I thought Jaxx was a great heroine and very different from all of Ms. Feehan's other heroines.  When Jaxx said that she wanted to help Lucian hunt the bad guys, she meant it - and she had the skills to back it up, unlike most of the other females.  Jaxx was tough, but she wasn't bitter and she was still very feminine.  This is just a beautiful love story - you are all in for a treat!;1
495849;Oh my God, this book is hilarious!  I'm loving these parenting books now that I have a son.  They make me feel less alone in this big, baby-obsessed world.  The author, Karen, is refreshingly honest and funny.  I love all the swearing that goes on in the book because I too have quite the potty mouth.  Totally worth the buy.;1

510576;It's been a couple years since I read &quot,Virgin&quot,, and I was pleased to learn that it was being republished as &quot,Cradle And All&quot,. Patterson did a great job of remodelling this story. It was just  as suspenseful as the first time I read it. I was fortunate to receive an  Advance Proof and I can tell you that this story still is chilling. For  those who never read &quot,Virgin&quot,, the story is about two virgins,  one a 16 year old girl from Newport, RI. The other girl, 14 years old, from  an Irish Village, and they're both pregnant. One is to give birth to the  Messiah, the other to Satan. No one knows which is the true virgin. This  story is as chilling as any other Patterson novel, if not more. You won't  finish the book disappointed.;1
327635;I started this book a month or more ago. Read to somewhere in the 50's page-wise... And it didn't really capture my interest. It could've been a mood I was in, or maybe the three pages dedicated to a rehashing and romanticizing of The Odyssey. Which felt like filler. Not sure, but it didn't work for me then.I decided to pick it up again the other day and skimmed through the parts I'd already read, then began in earnest. And what I read was fantastic!The tasks Callie sets up for herself, the way in which she goes about completing them, how Ralston gets himself tangled in it as well... It was highly entertaining. An excellent plot for the characters to work within.Who would have thought a fencing match could make your blood boil? Or a game of vingt-et-un could be so scandalous?It was delightful watching Callie and Ralston complete each task on her list, and the romance that bloomed as a result. MacLean took taverns, gentleman's clubs, and gambling dens and turned them into the most romantic places.Loved it!;1

306424;"What if you knew you died? Dead, cold as stone, not a beat left to your heart but you were still living? Still living that same day, your last day, over and over and over just hoping to finally get it right? That is life for Samantha Kingston, well that is non-life for Samantha Kingston.Sam doesn't go to heaven, or hell, or purgatory, or reincarnated, or even just cease to exist. She's not haunting people, living life as a ghost. No, she is stuck in the last day of her life forever.  Sam thought she had the perfect life but maybe what she thought of as perfect wasn't quite true. Now, she is on a quest to find a way out.""Before I fall"" is a beautiful poignant read... a must read novel. It's strange because this novel about dying really isn't about death at all. It's about living, and not living in the sense that you have to check everything off of your bucket list but trying to be the best part of you that there is. Sam's struggle isn't to be better than she is, it's simply to allow the best of her to come through, something she hans't done in a long time.This book deals with so many teen issues and I definitely think if you have a teenager in your life that you should pick this book up for them because they need to be reading it. Sex, alcohol, drinking, dating, friendship, bullying, family, love, jealousy, death...LIFE. I really don't know how Lauren Oliver packed all this into a book so seamlessly but she did. She truly did capture the essence of teenage life in such a well illustrated way.Surprisingly, I found nothing inappropriate for the age group. Sometimes, reading Young Adult genre I feel a little inappropriateness in the content. But not in this book, Oliver did a wonderful job of responsibly and realistically depicting Sam's life. Death. Dying. Life. Death is a difficult subject and this book drew me into contemplating the value of my own life.I could not put this book down. I seriously wanted to hunt Lauren Oliver down at 3 a.m. so I could slap her because I could not tear myself away from these pages (don't worry that's the good kind of slapping, haha) I am just so mesmerized and blown away by this novel it's hard to find words that do it justice.Not only is the content amazing, the characters are just blow-your mind great from Sam to all of her friends. And that is sort of a shocking thing because it must have been really difficult to Oliver to have such believable character development when the people are only existing in the same day repeatedly. Oh, the writing style! Wow, the voice in this novel was insane I loved it so much.Everything, was written with such eloquence and the voice was so believable. Not once was I drawn out of the world Oliver created to think, ""well now I didn't like that."" or ""hmmm, that's awkward."" Surprising too, because Sam is talking directly to the reader the whole time and I think that is a difficult narration to accomplish well. But Bravo Lauren Oliver, because she did it.The writing was just too crazy delicious to put this book down. There were definitely some notable quotes in this book. And there was FUNNY parts too, genuinely funny, laugh-out-loud moments. I laughed and I cried and I read until I was exhausted and my eyes were red and glossy because this book was one to be devoured.If you liked Delirium, if you like the Young Adult genre then you have to pick this book up today because you won't like it ...you'll LOVE it. It's that simple, because it will blow your mind in comparison to some of the other books that are out there. I think this book is PERFECT for teenagers, something that they must read.";1
386322;"I have been a fan of Ms. Albright since she became Secretary of State. I was very impressed with her book ""Madam Secretary"" and I feel the same with her recent book PRAGUE WINTER. Ms. Albright is my junior by ten years. Most of the events in Europe depicted in her book are etched in my memory. I can relate well to the recollection of her memories of those difficult and horrific years of the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia. Itsliberation from the Nazi yoke, regaining independence and then subjected to Communists denomination are all accurately narrated. The historical events are interwoven with Ms. Albright's life story. Her family's travails, in light of the general economic and social difficulties in Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and England, are accurately recorded. To escape Hitler her parents emigrated to England and eventually to the Unites State where Albright eventually served as Secretary of State under the Clinton administration.In 1997 Ms. Albright and her sister Kathy and brother John visited the Czech Republic to research their family history in light of the revelation concerning their Jewish ancestry that has appeared in the Washington Post. She was determined to discover as much as possible about her family, her upbringing and to try to grasp and embrace a new reality. She had been raised a Roman Catholic and upon marriage converted to the Episcopalian faith.  Her parents have never mentioned to her the family's Jewish background. Ms. Albright describes and grieves over the Germans' atrocities committed during the Holocaust against the Jewish population in her native land. She found out that at least twenty-five members of her family who were sent to Trezin, none survived. Her grandfather Arno't K&ouml,rbel died in Terezin, a prison disguised as a town, where most prisoners died from deprivation, diseases or had been deported to Auschwitz to be murdered there. Her description of the Nazis' inhumanity are striking and gripping. It is indeed a very painful and disturbing account of Nazi Germany. Ms. Albright is quoting Reinhard Heydrich, deputy of Hitler's security chief said: ""All Jews, whether religious or secular, bankers or bricklayers, were part of multigenerational conspiracy to dominate the world and annihilate Aryan values. The Jew, is the mortal enemy of Nordic-led and racially healthy folks."" There is not one iota of truth in that statement.Ms. Albright is also very objective regarding the events when the war ended. She reproaches the expulsions of three million Sudeten Germans and Slovakia Hungarians at the end of the war from 1945 to 1948.PRAGUE WINTER is a well written blend of history and autobiography. It is a book that we can all learn about the origins and history of Czechoslovakia that became the Czech Republic and Slovakia as known today. Albright is quoting her grandmother during the Holocaust saying ""The soul is purified by misfortune and sorrow, as gold by fire. Without sorrow there can be no joy.""  I could put it in other words. The Nazis deprived me of freedom for the entire duration of WWII,  I know how to appreciate the freedom granted me in this blessed country of the United States of America.";1
280521;This is wonderful. A good, old-fashioned, creepy book about things that go bump in the night. It reminds me a lot of early Stephen King - Christine, The Shining, or Tommyknockers especially - where a normal setting just isn't quite what it seems. The story is filled with sympathetic characters, bad guys, and a REALLY big monster. I know this is the beginning of a trilogy and was afraid that this book would end with no real resolution. Have no fears. The ending is finished enough that the reader won't be gnashing teeth wondering what happens, but anticipation for the next book is there. Anyone know when that next book is due? Highly recommended.;1
597859;When reading this story about the immigrant issue, the reader needs to remember it is a satire.  All the characters are stereotypical, but they do give voice to all the different opinions and feelings of living with or being illegal immigrants.

144947;"Once Korda reached 1945 in IKE, it feels like he filed all his research away and said, ""Let's wrap this up!""  Unfortunately, Ike still had 25 years left in him.  Consequently, Korda's biography feels incomplete.  Furthermore, for all the space Korda accords to Ike's WWII years, he pays scant attention to the Holocaust.  What did Ike know about the Holocaust, about the Final Solution?  What was his reaction to the liberation of the concentration camps (Korda mentions Ike's presence at just one, a sub-camp).  In light of the preeminence of Holocaust studies in the past 15 years, Korda really could have shed new light with a discussion of Ike and the plight of the Jewish people.  Similarly, the creation of Israel receives no mention in this book, even though Ike, as Supreme Commander of the AEF and, later, commander of NATO, would have seen, heard, and possibly opined on ""The Palestine Question.""  In short, if well done, a 900-page offering from Korda would have been more edifying than a 700-page tome.";1
548204;I prefer light reads as opposed to John Grisham's usual legal/mystery novels, so Skipping Christmas is his only book I have ever bothered to read. It's been a few years now since I read it and the only reason I'm bothering to review it now is because I just learned that it's being made into a movie! When I finished reading this book I told everyone what an excellent holiday movie it would make. I'm so glad that is finally happening! Although, I'm not going to jump the gun on that... I know that I often hope that books I've read will be adapted to the screen and I end up hating the movie because they never seem to do the book justice. Hopefully it will be different this time.At any rate, this book is highly recommended if you're looking for a light Christmas read that will give you many laugh-out-loud moments!;1

387813;Raymond Moody's best book yet! It is nice for a change to read an author who is willing to share his own poignant truth. For the person who questions any possibility of an Afterlife, he should read this book. Raymond Moody was down to earth and shares his vunerabillity and goes out on a limb giving the reader a broader understanding of his journey, getting closer to the truth in finding what is the Afterlife. Often people aren't ready to reveal so much of themselves but I applaud him in allowing the reader to see the side we often don't care to admit even to ourselves. He shows us what he dealt with personally and privately, and what comes with the type of illness he has had for his life time. Thank you, Raymond Moody for giving a better inside understanding into something even Albert Einstein believed in!;1
509392;Few people have more credentials to speak about progress and challenges in human-computer interaction than M. Dertouzos - the head of the Laboratory of Computer Sciences at MIT, which has a distinguished record of cutting-edge research in this and other fields. And yet many arguments and predictions in the book remain somewhat unconvincing.&quot,Why computers aren't as easy to use as cars?&quot, - asks the author, like many other people before him, frustrated by their perpetual complexity and cumbersomeness. But comparison with cars is misleading. Cars are not designed to allow motorists to put under the hood any additional gadgets they fancy, or to perform arbitrary maneuvers, pushing every button and handle simultaneously. Yet the development of PC industry was based on accommodating ever more and newer gadgets under its cover, and on allowing almost any user's action, short of whacking a motherboard with a sledgehammer.  Of course, many flaws of computer systems are due to the industry's geeky origins and traditions, or specific biases of programmers and early users. But the roadmap described by the author is not the first serious attempt at radical improvement, and the goal it is hardly closer today than a few years ago. Why?This probably has a lot to do with the economics of the computer industry, rather than other, more subjective, factors. As much as both hardware and software companies try to convince us how hard are they working to improve usability of their products, to eliminate bugs and crashes, the dirty secret of the industry is that it is not a top priority. Quality simply does not pay. In the &quot,physical&quot, world we often buy new things just to replace broken, or worn-out ones, not necessarily because the older items are hopelessly obsolete. Manufacturers have time and resources to gradually work out the kinks and improve design almost to perfection. With computers, on the other hand, &quot,physical&quot, amortization is low, so the only way to sell new systems is to cram them with more new features, no matter how poorly designed at first, and to make existing ones (no matter how proven and reliable) obsolete and incompatible. Simply reducing the number of bugs will not generate many sales. As a new feature appears, buggy and frustrating to use at first, the economic machine of the computer industry kicks into high gear. Magazines write raving reviews to increase their own sales, add-on manufacturers rush to incorporate it and propagate it down the sales channels, application developers write new drivers and other utilities which make new feature indispensable and previous versions obsolete.As a result, today complex software is not unlike a human genome - a product of often messy and chaotic evolution, rather than a compact and elegant design. Pieces of active, useful code (&quot,genes&quot,) are surrounded by &quot,junk&quot,, leftover from previous generations of development, often redundant and useless. Why it is there? Because it is easier and cheaper to throw more hardware to crunch ever-bloating volumes of code and not to touch old rusting scrap, than to design and debug fast, efficient code. And it is not getting any better.On the other hand, despite all these intrinsic problems and flaws, many complaints against computers are quite unreasonable. For example, the story often goes, it is difficult to find that text file created two months ago, or where are those digital pictures from the last trip. But this supposedly unfavorable comparison with the &quot,real world&quot, does not hold. Consider, for example, the tree-like directory/subdirectory/file hierarchy, used in most operating systems. In fact it closely resembles a real-world storage system - file cabinet/shelf/file/document, only better. Why are we complaining? Because we have much higher expectations of computerized data storage, than of a traditional file cabinet. A file cabinet requires careful maintenance, if we treat it the same casual way we do computer files, it would be totally unusable in two weeks. Complaints against computers notwithstanding, it is far easier to find past notes and other files on a computer than in a &quot,physical&quot, world.The same with the gripes against Internet search engines, repeated in the book - a familiar story about a list of 10.000 irrelevant links in response to a search query. I think it is just a trite clich&eacute,. Frankly, it never failed for me to quickly find stuff even without following &quot,exact&quot, grammar rules recommended by engines. Besides, there is a good chance to discover surprises, interesting and useful information among those &quot,10.000 links&quot,. Of course, one could have a negative experience with web searches. In the &quot,real world&quot, a stupid or badly posed question is unlikely to produce a useful answer. Why do we expect a different result from a search engine? Moreover, search engines in the last few years was among the most competitive and dynamic technologies, where leaders changed almost every year - Yahoo, Altavista, HotBot, Northern Light, Google, each progressively offering better, faster, more complete results.The author touts XML and &quot,semantic web&quot, technologies as one of the &quot,saviors&quot, to untangle the computer industry mess. Again, I have serious doubts about this proposed magic bullet. The beauty of the first versions of HTML, when it appeared in early 90's, was its simplicity and universality. Any intelligent person could master it in half a day, and publish a decent-looking web page, which could be seen on PC, Mac or UNIX workstations anywhere in the world. This was truly revolutionary. The XML and &quot,semantic web&quot, at the first glance is just a natural extension along this road. But instead introduces another big layer of complexity, reduces the pool of programmers who can quickly master it, opens the door to innumerable new bugs and inefficiencies. If HTML opened a new chapter in computer history, XML and its companion technologies do not. It is filling the same chapter with comments and footnotes until the text becomes illegible.;1
121512;This book is laugh out loud funny! Charlie Asher is a average guy who owns a second hand shop in San Fransisco. His life is forever changed when his wife dies after giving birth to their daughter Sophie, and Charlie is unexpectedly tapped to become a Death Merchant. Moore's hilarious dialogue and cast of lovable weirdos made this book hard to stop thinking about. I listened to it on CD and was excited for my commute every day, anxious to find out what would happen next. Moore's characters and plots are always completely out-there, but he makes the craziness believable and enjoyable.;1
40047;After waiting a year and a half Allegiant has finally came out!! I really did like this book for many different reasons while some scenes I did not like. Veronica Roth has amazed me with her writing since the beginning with Divergent (one of my favorite books). I am sad to  see this series grow because I got so connected with the characters and the action. Tris and Four are characters that I will forever re-read over and over again. Veronica's writing was intense and full of suspense as we got to see the operations of the fractions. I never read any of the spoilers so I went into Allegiant head first and discovered why I did love this series.It picks up right after Insurgent, after discovering who is Edith Prior is in the video. Allegaint really opens up more about the history of the fractions as well as the Allegiant's. While I was about to cry through some parts of the book it did start off slow to me. Allegiant showed us the people beyond the wall. Like the other books there are many sacrifices the characters go through to get to the end. Veronica Roth did a great job representing who Tris really is and her discovering who she really is. After reading on Veronica's site about the ending I felt it does fit the book perfectly. While others can be mad about the book remember that it remains true to the characters and what they did in every book.Tobia's character point of view really changes throughout the book. I felt that Roth made Tobia's more of a depressing character the entire novel. I did like his views because we got to see a different part of him and his fears through his eyes. He was more distant with Tris at times but it was more understandable once you read  Allegiant. The plot about the outside world beyond Chicago was really interesting because we learned more about Tris' mom and how she came to Dauntless etc.Overall the book was a good read, and it still has me thinking about the book to this day. There is so many questions that I would love to get answered but Veronica successfully did that with this book. It had a good ending that made me feel like crying and satisfied with what happened. I look forward to many other peoples reactions and thoughts after reading this final book in the Divergent series, but the first book will always be my favorite. Thank you Veronica Roth for creating this series and making the series one of my favorites. I will definitely be reading future books by this author!;1

107555;In this book as in other Gaiman novels, the characters are the star.  The story is good and the settings are OK, but it really is his imagination with the characters that set him apart.  The two main characters, Shadow and Wednesday, both are complex and enjoyable.  The supporting cast is also really varied.  In turns spiteful, ethereal, crass, innocent, folksy, and crumudgeonly, the supporting characters are really rich and is the X factor in making this a really enjoyable read.What I liked:Outstanding characters, varied and imaginativeThough parts were predictable, I thought that the story in general lent itself to lots of surprises.Really fun take on American culture, history, and folkloreMeh:In this as in Neverwhere, the journey was better than the destination.

71593;I use this book almost every week, to check how to buy, store, or prepare particular vegetables, especially those that are so seasonal that I don't cook them that often: okra, for example. I like this book a lot for the advice it gives on Availability, Selection, Storage, Basic Preparation, and Best Cooking Methods for each vegetable. That section, at the beginning of each vegetable (the veggies are in alphabetical order, starting with Artichoke, ending with Zucchini), is two pages long. Following this basic information are 4-6 pages of recipes for that vegetable. These recipes are almost always, as another reviewer pointed out, for veggies as side dishes, not entrees. These recipes are okay, but not that exciting. Still, I do recommend this book.;1

Stop waiting for that special time to use the good china and use it NOW.  Stop waiting until you lose the weight in order to get pampered at the spa---DO IT NOW!!!

243677;FOREVER PRINCESSMEG CABOTContemporary Young AdultHarperTeenRating: 4.5 EnchantmentsIn the tenth and final book in the Princess Diaries series, FOREVER PRINCESS fast forwards two years from the end of the last book. To catch you up, Mia and J.P. are a (seemingly) happy couple, Michael's been busy in Japan, but he and Mia have been emailing occasionally and she still isn't friends with Lily. But everything is about to change as the end of Mia's senior year quickly approaches, as well as her eighteenth birthday and the fact she suddenly has to make a choice about which college she'll end up going to. And in the biggest surprise event of all--Michael returns unexpectedly. Yep, her ex who she really isn't a hundred percent over despite being happy with boyfriend J.P. is back in good old NYC and is happy to see her. Mia just isn't so sure she's as happy to see him.In the midst of all this chaos, good old Dr. Knutz thinks Mia can make her life so much more simpler by just telling the truth, which honestly, is so much easier said than done. For example, she got in to every college she applied to, but she told everyone she didn't. Why would she want to upset her friends who didn't get into their first choice when she did?FOREVER PRINCESS has quickly become one of my favorite books in the series. Mia's struggling with a lot and even more when she finds out Michael's back in town. I loved the scene where Mia finds herself pulled back to the press room by none other than Lily to say hello to him and then when she lies and tells him she was there to cover the event for the school paper, he offers to go out for coffee with her to do an interview, which leads to probably my favorite scene in the entire book. I have to say I was surprised by some of the revelations that pop up in the book about a certain person in Mia's life, although its probably easy to see coming the deeper you get in FOREVER PRINCESS. But I loved the way things turn out for our favorite Princess of Genovia. Fans of the series will love the way Ms. Cabot wraps things up in this highly entertaining and pure fun read.To celebrate the release of FOREVER PRINCESS, tiaras designed by Meg Cabot, fellow YA authors Sarah Dessen and Judy Blume and celebrities and designers such as Lauren Conrad, Vera Wang, Tommy Hilfiger, Bobbi Brown and Austin Scarlett from Project Runway, are being auctioned off to benefit the New York Public Library, Tiara Proceeds to Help Fund Tutoring & Book Groups for New York City's Teens.

263365;"100% recommended! This romp through the Hebrew Bible is much more than just fascinating and funny. It's also engrossing, mildly irreverent, thought-provoking, disturbing--you'll love the Good Book whether you're a believer or not. This is the Bible unveiled in all its grime and greatness. The characters in Genesis are especially unforgettable, from the story of Abimalech lusting after a 90-year-old woman (Sarah, Abraham's wife) to a diabolical mother-and-son plot to rob the simple-minded Esau of his blessing from an over-trusting father.Book by book, Plotz takes us through the scripture. If Genesis is the best part, then the appendix runs a close second. There you'll learn the Bible's twelve best pick-up lines, the thirteen most spectacular murders, the nine best parties, the best prostitutes, the most hellacious divine punishment, the trippiest dreams, and more.This is for all you skeptics who think reading the Bible is a waste of time. Plotz apparently thought the same thing before taking on this project. After thirty-nine books, 929 chapters, more than 600,000 words, and just over a year, Plotz admits he's become ""a full-on Bible thumper. Everyone should read it--all of it! In fact, the less you believe, the more you should read.""Start with this book as an introduction to get the juices flowing. Plotz is more than a good researcher, he's a great writer. I'm in awe. I could enthusiastically read anything he writes, I'm sure of it. So, when he tackles a topic already fascinating to me (the Bible) it's pure delight. He's also unfortunately a Jew, which means we only get the Old Testament in his Good Book. Please, David, can't you give Billy Graham a listen?";1
136488;This is a quirky, funny romantic comedy about Tommy and Jody in which Jody just happens to be a vampire. I laughed out loud at some of the scenes in this book. There's plenty of wacky plot twists to keep you reading untill the end. I especially liked Tommy's co-workers at the supermarket where he works at night stocking the shelves. This book is not your usual dark and scary vampire story. It is light and funny and has a lot to say about relationships.;1
597220;D. M. Thomas writes lyrically about horrific events. White Hotel pulls no punches in describing the viciousness of the holocaust. Many will complain that they don't need to read depressing stories but as long as the horrors of genocide remain abstract, we are at risk of repeating those horrors. White Hotel exposes the banality of evil that Hannah Arendt described, the casual ordinariness of unbelievable cruelty. For me, the hotel itself is merely life where we go on in the face of unspeakable events and in the knowledge that we all die. I denied the book the final star because I felt the final chapter was an effort to &#34,balance&#34, the picture and subtract some of the heaviness. I found that chapter tedious and not nesely as beautifully written as the rest of the book. Others will, no doubt, disagree.;1

631901;Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus, first published in 1818, is well-deserved classic of science fiction and horror. Mary Shelley's work, much like the similarly influential Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson (see my review of that here on Amazon for more on that tale), has almost been forgotten in its original form, as so many adaptations - most quite different from the original - have been produced in the nearly two centuries since it first appeared.The story begins with an introductory framing narrative by Robert Walton, an arctic explorer who catches a glimpse of a giant person traveling through the ice shortly before rescuing a stranded traveler who turns out to be Victor Frankenstein.Frankentein, a young Swiss student of chemistry and natural philosophy, relates his tale to Walton, who then records it in letters to his sister in England. Frankenstein describes how he created artificial life, only to be repulsed by the hideousness of the new being. Frankenstein abandons the creature, which then disappears.However, some time later, the creature begins taking revenge for his abandonment and misery upon Frankenstein's loved ones. Eventually tracking his creation down, the being tells Frankenstein his own tale of how he has attempted to befriend humans, only to be hated and driven away each time. The creature extracts a promise from Frankenstein to create a mate for him, after which the pair will disappear.Frankenstein begins to work on another creature, but eventually decides that he cannot create another monster and destroys his work. This prompts the creature to continue his campaign of revenge upon Frankenstein, eventually leading to the chase into the arctic. At this point, Walton resumes the narration and describes the final climax of the relationship between Frankenstein and his creation.The central theme of the story is the creation of life and the responsibility of the creator to his creation, as framed by the now-classic science fiction device of the artificial creation of life. Frankenstein, though the main character, could hardly be described as a hero in this narrative with his abandonment of the creature and self-centered actions, and the creature manages to illicit both sympathy from his lonely misery and horror with the lengths to which he will go to enact his revenge. Shelley does a fine job of taking the reader between these contradictions.I listened to the audio version read by Ralph Cosham, a favorite narrator of mine, and can certainly recommend Cosham's reading of the tale. Cosham's readings of the classics are always well done.Shelley's language will sound archaic to modern readers. However, if you can manage to get past that or you actually enjoy that style, Frankenstein is well worth reading. It has earned its place in popular culture and as a foundational tale in both the science fiction and horror genres. Do yourself a favor, and read the original Frankenstein. You'll find a lot more than the grunting, shambling monster of the movies. Shelley's creation is as alive, powerful, and intelligent as Frankenstein's.;1
142416;"I am really curious about all the high ratings for this book.  The premise was actually quite interesting and the H was likable.  What brought my entire entertainment to a screeching halt was how unbelievably irritating the h was.  About a third of the way in, I found myself rolling my eyes and saying, 'shut up you, annoying twit!'  She's supposed to be a dentist which, I'm assuming involves brains and intelligence, yet she seemed void of both.  The man saves her and how does she show her gratitude? Gets bossy, huffy, etc.  Ugh.  I wanted to scream at her asking ""who ARE you?!  You just met him about 2 hours ago and you're telling him how to run his security!""  She has the Russian mob after her and she's behind of fortress of armed guards yet she wants to leave.  Childish temper tantrum.  Sorry.  I'm about suspension of belief but I find it hard to believe someone would put her anguished feelings for a guy she met less than 24 hours prior over her own life.And all the ""God's blood"" comments were just too much.  I found that incredibly irritating.Not a fan.  I may give another book in the series a chance, but this one just didn't do it for me.";1
552603;I just finished Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee.  I'm astonished and disgusted.  I can't believe this topic is not covered better in school.  We spend all this time on the Civil War and then gloss over the native american wars.  I'm fairly disgusted with the federal government right now.The native americans were astonishing people.  Think what they could have taught us.  It is very sad to know the fate of their great leaders, either assassination or death by mental defeat.  They were incredibly smart men.  You would have thought that some of our religious leaders would have been more brave and active in quelling the genocide.  This is very recent history for us, it occurred in my backyard here in Colorado, and yet it does not seem to be on our conscience.This is a great book.  I would recommend it to anyone.;1

513027;I really enjoyed the first half of this book, but it ran out of steam and/or I lost interest in it toward the end. Al Bernstein writes well and is quite humorous in his presentations of the different kinds of emotional vampires out there, just waiting to get their fangs into you. However, this book got to me after a while. It seems that Bernstein has dealt with all of these types of vampires personally, and that comes out more in the second half of the book. Just a hunch on my part. This is more of a subjective non-scientific self-help book. It left me with the impression that the majority of people around us (and ourselves too) have some vampiric traits, so that it becomes hard to know how to deal with emotional vampires if the majority of people are vampires. You would be constantly protecting yourself and trying not to get hurt in relationships. Quite exhausting--being abused by vampires and trying to protect yourself all the time, as well as trying to deal with your own vampiric tendencies if they exist.;1
240336;"The debate of what makes human beings unique has been around for as long as the humanity itself. In fact, somewhat self-reflexively, it could be the definition of the human uniqueness: we are the only species that is capable of exploring its own uniqueness. Nonetheless, one of the ways that is intuitively obvious that we are if not unique than at least very special is our ability to form abstract ideas and transmit those ideas to others in ways that will make them act on them.  The extent to which ideas are transmittable depends on the persuasiveness of the transmitter. However, there are also such ideas that can become highly ""transmittable"" and influential based on the content of idea itself. And if a highly transmittable idea has potential to cause harm to an individual or the society at large, then it becomes dangerous. That, in a nutshell, is the raison d'etre of this short book. In it we find 108 prominent scientists, philosophers and public intellectuals expound on what they consider to be the most dangerous idea today. The result is an interesting and very entertaining book that is a lot of fun to read and ponder.The ideas in this book are as varied as are those who present them. Some are truly fascinating and novel, but I fund many of them to be quite unremarkable. There are a few that are just exercises in sophistry that may sound profound, but are rather mundane. Many of these ideas have been around for quite a while, and are even considered parts of well-established schools of thought that nonetheless have very little impact on either the safety of those who propound them or at the society at large. This is particularly true of the ideas coming from the academic circles - professors like to have this daring image of themselves where they are constantly ""speaking truth to power,"" while they are in fact just reflecting the conventional worldview that they and their colleagues have been a part of for generations. Nonetheless, it was interesting to see how those ideas have been presented in a somewhat novel and more modern garb.";1

16537;"Lewis's writing these days is widely regarded as of exclusive interest to the God Squad and that is a pity.  Certainly this is a work of pretty straightforward religious propaganda, a supernatural thriller written by someone who takes the supernatural stuff with the utmost seriousness but, hey, so is ""The Exorcist"" and that needn't disqualify it from entertaining the unconverted.This novel is the last and the only earthbound instalment of Lewis's Space trilogy. It's a theological, thriller in which the forces of darkness are seeking to destroy humanity through the agency of the sinister National Institute for Co-ordinated Experiments or NICE.The plot had two distinct threads. One involves Mark Studdock, a young don at the rather All-Souls-like Bracton College in the fictitious English town of Edgestow (which Lewis in a preface insists is not based on Durham). Mark is a weak man with a desperate desire for recognition and inclusion and is all to easily sucked into the unpleasant world of NICE. He fondly imagines they are headhunting him in recognition of his many talents but in fact they are mainly interested in him as a way to get at his wife, Jane, whose visionary dreams they perceive, rightly, as a threat. And Jane is the subject of the second plot line. While Mark is being sucked in to the world of the baddies at their headquarters at Belbury, a former blood transfusion centre, Jane is falling in with the goodies, a disparate band of desperately nice people at the manor at St Anne's, under the leadership of the charismatic Director, the Ransom of ""Out of the Silent Planet"" and ""Perelandra"".The St Anne's parts of the story are the less impressive. Ransom has been turned by his experiences on Mars and Venus into an outrageously charismatic, ageless and near-superhuman religious leader who is really a lot less interesting than the very human Ransom of the earlier stories and who spends most of his time delivering rather dull and condescending anti-feminist lectures to Jane. (We are constantly told she would ordinarily have found such lectures insufferable but he is just so charismatic, you see...) Recently fashionable stuff about the wisdom of being a ""surrendered wife"" really just recapitulates Ransom's line here though Lewis surely writes far better than more recent advocates of such doubtful ideas and perhaps succeeds making them as attractive and compelling as it is humanly possible to make them.The Belbury-Mark story is a lot more fun and comprises a splendid and acute essay in political satire. The picture it paints of a grimly rotten beaurocratic institution guided by what pass for ""progressive"" social ideals is one of the nicest things Lewis ever wrote. (Lewis's intellectual agenda here echoes in a fictional context thoughts he develops in ""The Abolition of Man"", one of his most interesting non-fiction essays.) Particularly well done is Belbury's ""Deputy Director"" Wither, whose talks a wonderful and hilarious form of verbal anti-matter that is all too recognisable as only a slight exaggeration of the worst sort of British public sector Managementspeak. The news management techniques espoused by the NICE are again satirically telling and in a strikingly contemporary way: New Labour, one fears, would have loved the NICE with their fascination with spin and ""modernization"".Perhaps the best and most insightful thing about the book is the characterization of Mark Studdock, an extremely telling, frighteningly plausible portrait of a man drawn into collaboration with evil not by wickedness but by weakness, a desperation to belong, to feel himself accepted in the world of those who wield the power and pull the strings. It's enormously unlikely that Hitler's Germany or Mao's China contained enough simply wicked people to sustain such poisonous regimes. But it is also enormously likely that they contained many many people who were foolish and weak in just the ways Mark Studdock was, people whose collaboporation makes them appropriate objects more for pity than for hatred.The climax is inevitably rather over the top, involving as it does the resurrection of the Arthurian druid Merlin whose ancient powers are crucial to determining the outcome of the conflict. Obviously things get a bit bonkers at this point but Lewis is rare among thriller writers for his scholarship and has the erudition in matters Arthurian to carry it off as well as anyone ever could. A real curiosity then, strange and sometimes a bit nuts but also very well-written, satirically telling, often psychologically and politically insightful and very readable.";1
375435;Night Betrayed is the first book I've read in what is apparently an ongoing series. I didn't really feel like I needed the other books to understand the storyline - 50 years after 90% of the population is killed by a unnatural disaster the remaining humans are doing the best they can. While I don't generally care for paranormal romance, when it's done well it's one of my favorite things. Night Betrayed is done well. It was a three and a half star read for me because of some logical issues that may have been explained in earlier books. (Electricity? Leftover fuel for limited vehicles?)Serena is a woman who can see the dead leave their bodies, Theo is a man who has failed to age. Meeting her, he realizes that trying to have a relationship with a woman his physical age is never going to give him what he really craves - an equal partner. Settling in to Serena's home, Theo fights to understand her need to save the soul of the 'zombies', dead predators that roam the night. The strongest things going for Night Betrayed is the recognition that a guy who's been around for a hundred or so years and a girl who is in her twenties aren't going to have much to talk about. Even with the age difference they do have, Theo and Serena were more believable as a couple than many paranormal romances offer.While obviously a chapter in a larger story arc, Night Betrayed ultimately told a sweet story of a second chance at love between two people who think their beliefs are at odds. If you ever enjoyed Mad Max or Escape From New York, you'll probably find a lot to enjoy here.  (I received an advance copy of this book);1

331193;Like most of Kundera's books of essays there is a mixture of humility and chattiness that are both a strength and weakness of the book. The tone welcomes the reader and does not put him/her off with Kundera's sense of expertise but invites the reader to share in his experience, but the result is often not particularly insightful. However, there are little bits of insight buried in the book if you do the work of reading some of the quick and superficial looks at paintings, music and novels. The last long piece is particularly interesting, providing a review of the writer Malaparte (whom I'd never heard of) and his two books written immediately following WWII, particularly the Skin. Kundera appreciates the art of this novel and Malaparte's attempts to utilize many different forms to create his work.Kundera's wide ranging reading in Eastern Europe also introduce many not very well known writers in this part of the world. Unfortunately, some of the authors I couldn't find in English when I wanted to go read them as well.As always Kundera highlights the importance of laughter and humor in art, of focusing on the art's portrayal of humanity and beauty and not on politics and horror.;1
8885;I love these books.I even occasionally re-read them.  Who wouldn't love a spiritual adviser like Jon in there lives?Each book stands alone, and yet, when you are done?  There is the added treat of being able to read 'the other side of the story' or to continue on to the lives of other characters.When I first read them, I thought some of the theological debates were tedious, because the author really has the ability to write a page turner as well.  However, in re-reading, since I already know what will happen, I relax and completely enjoy the entire book.She writes compelling characters, and their justifications, extremely well.  I have loaned this, and others from the series, to skeptical friends, and every single one wanted one thing.  MORE.  How happy were they when I showed them the other books!Anyway, it doesn't really matter which one you start with.  Glamorous Powers is the first one I read, and it completely hooked me.Curl up in your favorite chair with this book, you are in for a treat.;1

367715;The reviews and synopsis for Die for Me really undersell the book. Had it not been for the setting in Paris, I would have skipped right over it as 'same old, same old'. Plum's setting and choice to create a new lore in 'zombies' was a very refreshing read. And while 'zombie' and 'monster' appear frequently, the one comparison to 'guardian angel' is more apt since the Revenants are not undead and the good deeds they do are hardly monstrous.Vincent and Katie are likeable characters. Although there is a section of the book that Katie's low self esteem and Vincent's tendency toward emo get a little stereotypical, the section passes quickly and the plot continues smoothly. As another reviewer stated, there are Twilight aspects. I even experienced a small Vincent withdrawal at the end like I did with Edward after Twilight. But Plum creates enough of a different world that the reader can get over those instances to get back to the universe she created. Some of the reviews are a little too analytically critical instead of just enjoying the story Plum is trying to tell.Overall, the setting, folk lore, and characters are a refreshing change from the same old teen supernatural plots that have come about since Twilight. I personally cannot wait for Plum to continue the series.;1
18418;If you enjoy historical fiction with elements of the paranormal, you will probably enjoy this novel.Starting in the present, Edinburgh based historian, Viv Lloyd Rees, has immersed herself in the legends surrounding the Celtic queen Cartimandua. She has written a book about Cartimandua and is a working on a dramatisation of her life. Viv 'borrows' a brooch which is considered to have ties to Cartimandua and increasingly becomes caught up in what appears to be the life and times of Cartimandua.This experience is not confined to Viv: others associated with her also become caught up in what appears to be a reliving of key events from the life and times of Cartimandua.The switches between the present and the past, and the points of view of different characters, are both intensely irritating and an important part of the plot.I enjoyed those parts of the novel set in the past far more than those set in the present.Jennifer Cameron-Smith;1
185198;This is the sequel to the wonderful novel, The Bean Trees. For some strange reason, the books do not label each other as sequels, but the so very much are.Basic Summary: This picks up 3 years after the conclusion of The Bean Trees, when Turtle (who was thrust upon Taylor at a bar on the side of the road in Oklahoma) has fully settled into life with her Non-Indian mother in Arizona. Everything changes for them after Turtle is the only witness to a man falling down a spillway at Hoover Dam, an event that makes her a primetime hero. She's featured on Oprah, with other children who have saved lives, and is spotted by Annawake Fourkiller - a lawyer for the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. Annawake instantly knows that Turtle is Cherokee and begins finding a way to have her returned to the tribe where, Annawake feels, she best belongs. Shenanigans and hijinx ensue in this moving tale of family, Cherokee culture and the gentle way of the South.This book was delicately written, soft-spoken with such unexpected power. I had tears in my eyes by the end of the book, eagerly devouring each page -- anxious to find out what would happen to Turtle. Barbara Kingsolver does an unmatched job of creating depth in her surroundings. It is evident that she cares very much about the seemingly innocuous details of the Cherokee tribe culture, the southern dialects, the NW weather.. everything she put to words, she put with her heart.I loved this book.;1
473370;I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little scared to read this book. I've never read Molly McAdams other book Taking Chances but I read a lot about it. I honestly wasn't sure what to expect when I started this book. But man am I glad I gave this book a chance!Cassidy is finally free. After almost twelve years of being abused and feeling like she'll never have a future, Tyler takes her with him to Texas. But just because she's finally away from California doesn't mean that her past doesn't haunt her. I really liked Cassidy. I can't even begin to understand how she could have dealt with the life she was handed and it's insane how she came out of that normal. Well beyond normal honestly. She's the sweetest girl and despite always being surrounded by violence, couldn't even hurt a fly. I found it slightly annoying how every guy that came in contact with her found her insanely attractive and wanted to be with her. But honestly, it stopped bothering me really quickly.The only problem with her for me was the fact that I had love/hate relationship with some of her personality traits. Mainly her need to depend on someone. But considering her past it makes sense. Still I wish she would've learned to depends on herself more. It also pissed me off that her first instinct is to run away when things get bad. But this book is a journey for Cassidy and we really get to see her grow, make mistakes a lot granted, but she definitely changes a lot since the beginning.Tyler, the best friend. Hmm I'm still not sure how I feel about him. Throughout most of the book I really wished he would disappear. He purposely ruined everything and I couldn't even understand how someone who swears loves Cassidy could do those things to her. He thinks he has this claim over her and frankly it's kind of unhealthy. As the book progresses it gets worse to the point where he was manipulating her. A lot happens in this book and Tyler does a change eventually but honestly I still don't really like him.Gage is hands down one of my favorite fictional men ever!! From the moment he meets Cassidy, she is it for him. He's sweet, funny, handsome as hell and even a bit possessive (but not to any crazy extents). I feel really bad for him a lot throughout the book because it seems he's always getting his heart broken. He does make some mistakes though too but it's just blown out of proportions as these things do when outside people get in your business. I also really loved Gage's family as well as their circle of friends. Everyone is really nice.The book wraps up wonderfully and even though I feel like Gage and Cassidy's story is over I was left wondering about some other people. Mainly Amanda (Gage's sister) and Jesse (Cassidy's friend). Nothing was said about them so I'm hoping and wishing that Amanda and Jesse get their own story.To everyone who isn't sure if they should read this: Read. It. I don't know how Taking Chances was but this book will blow your minds in the best possible way and leave you feeling giddy and content all at the same time. I can't wait to see what this author thinks of next!*Received from Edelweiss and William Morrow Paperbacks in exchange for an honest review.;1
532505;Michael Crichton in his book Timeline reminds us that reading is for fun and entertainment.  Many readers appear to be very serious about their preoccupation.Timeline is a quick easy read combining two of my very favorite subjects time travel and the medieval life.  While Crichton does go into some scientific explanations about quantum physics it doesn't bog down the book or detract from the pace of the story.Crichton presents an interesting cast of characters who could easily be exchanged with a variety of Hollywood actors and actresses.These characters are involved in a form of medieval beat the clock as they race to find their way back to the present.  Even with their knowledge of the time and place they find the middle ages to be a dangerous threatening time.When the adventure ends, one could easily imagine their continuing adventures in their travels through time.If you enjoy reading about the middle ages and like action and adventure this is a book for you.  If you are a serious reader looking for meaning, character and plot development and enjoy dissecting a book it might be a good idea to skip it.;1

218974;The main mystery in this book is often dull and convoluted, which takes away from the overall flow of the book.  However, that's not the reason why this one should be read.

45572;"I love Ernest Hemingway's writing, and have read a number of his books.  This is probably one of the books that he is most well-known for.  The story is set on the Italian front of World War I, and it tells the story of two star-crossed lovers.  Hemingway's themes for each of his books are so realistic because he experienced a lot of the things he wrote about himself.  That's what makes his books so wonderful.  Hemingway did not have a good opinion of war, and these thoughts come through loud and clear in this book.  The story is about Lieutenant Frederic Henry, an American who has volunteered to serve with an Italian ambulance unit during World War I.  Catherine Barkley is the nurse whom Frederic nicknames ""Cat"", and who he falls in love with.  Hemingway's other characters are all equally well-drawn.  His plot and his description of scenes is also wonderful  Hemingway uses his descriptions of place as allegories to human well-being and luck.  Hemingway associates the plains and rains with death, disease and sorrow, and the mountains and the snow with life, health and happiness.  His two lovers experience happiness and safety in the mountains, but they cannot stay there indefinitely, so when they go back to the plains, bad things happen to them.  A Farewell to Arms appears to be a bleak tale, but it delineates probably more than any other of Hemingway's works his fatalistic attitude to life and death.  Hemingway is a wonderful author, and his works are well worth reading.";1
66956;This is empowering and enlightening!  I have been married for 14 years and I wish I would have read this as a newlywed.  I would have learned so much quicker how to effectively communicate with my husband without so much trial and error.  I could have benefited from setting limits on how much I give and asking and expecting more support from my husband.  I thought it was amusing to recognize myself in some of the true-to-life scenarios like waiting out my husband for him to do the dishes&#8230,and he never noticed.  We are wired differently and I was in denial thinking he just didn&#8217,t care like an insensitive jerk.  I learned way too late in marriage to be direct with him and ask for what I want otherwise he will never know.  I built up resentment and he had no idea what hit him when I finally told him how I felt.It has practical insights that will give me more confidence in my relationship with my husband and others.  I can even understand so-called irrational women a little bit better because I am not as typical as they are.  I offer solutions to my husband while he needs me to just listen to feel better.  I found myself in a few role reversals in this book particularly how I go into my cave and need to think things through to figure out how to respond before I blow up while my husband wants to talk right away.  I grew up watching my parents pretend everything was okay while feelings were severely suppressed.I think a helpful companion book to this is &#8220,The Five Love Languages&#8221, which I read a couple of years ago.  Used together they can make relationships more meaningful.  I think this is kind of like the &#8220,Idiot&#8217,s Guide to Understanding the Opposite Sex.&#8221,  Some explanations I thought were silly and men and women overreact, and maybe they do but that is the way we are made.  For instance, I thought who cares if I ask my husband &#8220,Can you help me&#8221, instead of &#8220,Will you help me?&#8221,  Apparently it makes a big difference and I have vaguely noticed it sometimes but I thought &#8220,I am asking you, my husband of 14 years to help, just help me already dangit!  Don&#8217,t be such a baby full of pride!&#8221,  It is interesting that even though we say some of the same phrases we mean something different or understand it another way.  This book has changed my perspective in a positive way and will make my life simpler.;1
374168;"Even though this is the 14th Ian Rutledge mystery I found that it stood quite adequately on its own, and was deeply satisfying.  I did puzzle over what seemed to be a just-ended romance.  Rutledge and his peculiar form of ""shell shock"" intrigued me a great deal, so that I ordered the first book of the series, ""A Test of Wills"", before I was half through this one.  The settings in this book were very effective, especially the isolated Essex village where much of the action occurs.  The mystery was complicated and I couldn't guess  who the murderer was or even what the motive was until just pages before the end.  Keeping the many characters straight was easy, and the many plot twists added to the excitement.  There were lots of very dramatic scenes, and quite a bit of violence.  The main woman character Cynthia Farraday, didn't come to life too well for me, I never felt that I understood her.  It's a quick read and quite well-written, although never self-consciously so.  The climax was so exciting it was hard not to rush through it.I'm so pleased to have found a new series to enjoy.  The time, just after WWI, is very interesting, and this series seems to fit well with Anne Perry's short WWI series, dealing with some of the same moral issues of war and loss.";1

203662;"In ""A Thief of Time"", Tony Hillerman describes the Desert Southwest, especially the landscapes of the Colorado Plateau, marvelously. His two Navajo detectives are defined very well, Hillerman makes sure that the two men are not stereotypes of each other, but have separate ambitions, challenges, beliefs, and experience. They are not drawn to each other because they happen to be Navajo, but because the cases they are each working on just happen to coincide. And just because they are Navajo, they don't automatically take up each other's cause, but are drawn into the mystery for different reasons. I found this to be very authentic and very refreshing, as I also found the way Hillerman describes their processes for solving crimes, with a lot of shoe leather and inductive reasoning.But these two strong characters could not compensate for the weakness in the rest of the characters, for a crime that is underdeveloped, and for an ending that is anticlimactic. Hillerman explores many issues that are pertinent to the Desert Southwest and to Native culture, but he doesn't set these issues into context well enough to fully educate the reader or provide an emotional conclusion.";1
511772;"Just finished ""24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success"" by Bill O'Neil, who happens to be the publisher of Investor's Business Daily. Consequently, the book is more or less an extended commercial for the paper -it is an investor's guide, but an investor's guide as applied to using Investor's Business Daily.However, there's a good balance of information here. If you can steer past the obvious bias, he has some good tips I'd like to try out some day. He presents a formulaic approach for success in the market - not too conservative nor too risky. It certainly makes good sense. And it's obviously worked well for him.";1

165629;"First off, I want to say that I adored this audiobook -- I also read the paperback version.  It is a most unusual story, and so very compelling. I felt I truly got to know every character in the story, and am eager now to read Patchett's other works. As for the ending, I thought it made perfect sense, and it was rather satisfying in my opinion.However, my complaint... is with the reviewers who have come before me. What on earth makes you think that it is okay to reveal endings in the reviews? I am SO thankful I hadn't read any of your reviews! It is outrageous that a reviewer would spoil a ""surprise"" ending in the manner some have done here. Very selfish indeed.

81127;"First of all, I love it when you have to use your imagination in a story and E.B. White is a wonderful story-teller. Whenever I read this book, I think of lazy summer nights by the campfire and someone telling this story to sleepy-eyed children, while the lightening bugs flicker and owls hooting in the distance. It's a great story for all ages.Louis is born without a voice. He is a Trumpeter Swan and he must have a voice otherwise he won't be able to mate someday. He went to school with his friend, Sam Beaver, and learned to read and write. But that didn't help because none of the other swans knew how to read and write. So his father decided to steal a trumpet for Louis so Louis can ""talk."" And the adventures for Louis begin as he works all across the USA to pay for the stolen trumpet and the damages to the store. Along the way, Louis finds his true love again and they get married.It's a wonderful story about courage, honesty and bravery. Louis braved strange places and made himself a living to earn money to pay back his father's debts. It's a deeply imaginative story as well ~~ you can almost see the mist rising off the small pond in Canada in the early sunrise.No matter how old you are, you are never too old to read this rich story. It's written for everyone who has an imagination. It's a must-read for serious readers ~~ it stays with you for a life-time!1-12-04";1

613646;This book, now approaching its hundredth birthday, was one of the great discoveries of my childhood.  It's a little more demanding, perhaps, than most contemporary &quot,intermediate&quot, fiction, although it's possible that Harry Potter has opened some minds to the possibilities of this sort of fantasy.  I would recommend the sand-fairy series to any child who loves Harry Potter, the Chronicles of Narnia, or the wry works of John Bellairs.;1
611621;I was excited to read this book with my 7-year-old because of the artwork and the blurb on the back that made it seem like an exciting read.  By judging this book by its cover (and illustrations, which are lovely), I thought it might turn out that the bears are metaphorical representations of the child's fear or something, I guess.  But, no.  He sees shadowy maybe-bears, he hides under the pot, he hears crunching footprints and sniffing, then his dad comes to rescue him.  And it turns out now the adults accept that there are bears.  Fairly docile bears traveling together when they probably should still be hibernating.  Sure.To be fair, my 7-year-old son enjoyed reading this.  He enjoyed the style, illustrations, and initial sense of freedom, but when we tried to talk about the author's theme or purpose in writing this, he figured it was either that adults are sometimes totally wrong or that you should assume that your worst fears are true--or a combination of both, really.  Adults surely are sometimes wrong, but I don't think this is a helpful message. Hey, ignore the adults in your life, kids!  You know nature is scary, so stay out of it!I know the boy in this story has other good experiences in nature, and there is also a somewhat weak theme about staying on task (if he had stayed on task, he wouldn't be out at night), but those messages are not nearly as strongly conveyed as the message that the adults were totally wrong and he should be very afraid of crunching sounds in the night.;1

388274;"Eve takes place in 2032, a post-apocalyptic earth where a deadly virus has wiped out most of the world's population. The main character, Eve, is preparing to graduate from her all-girls' boarding school when she makes a terrible discovery about what fate really awaits her in the adult world. Reeling, she embarks on a daring and perilous journey to find a home where she will have freedom and shelter - a place she isn't even sure exists.I must have been sucked in by this, because I read it in one sitting. But on reflection, I'm feeling pretty dissatisfied with the book as a whole. The problems that stand out to me the most are ones that I've found with a lot of YA lit lately.The main protagonist, Eve, errs terribly many times on her journey, and even leads to the violent death of certain people she meets along the way. However, she is never held accountable for her blunders - not by the other characters or by the author. I don't think there is anyone who would (or should) lay down their life or liberty for this self-interested girl, and I don't think she should be absolved for her aberrant disregard for others. She never stops to think whether her bid for freedom is worth the lives of the people around her.I don't care for this character, and she is not infuriating in such a way as to build a kind of begrudging regard, so what am I left with? A few secondary characters that I am concerned with and a world which is thought-provoking but gallingly under-developed.What I Loved:I was drawn to this plot mostly because I love journey books and, despite all my qualms, I still think many people will like this book. It's certainly better than a lot that's out there. The reason I'm putting this book under such scrutiny is because the writing was surprisingly acceptable, and I get the feeling that Carey is better than this. Some elements were particularly strong, like Eve's relationship with the young wild-boys, and these should have been more central to the plot.What Was Lacking:The romance seems rushed. I think many authors bow to the pressure for couples to `get together' or recognise their feelings in a short amount of time in order to fit in with the time-frame of the first book. This particular story would have worked better if the romance was slower burning, and the bourgeoning trust carried over into the sequels. When characters unite too soon other things then need to be put in their path to keep the drama alive. I can see the absurdity escalating - far-fetched love-triangles and contrived reasons why they just can't be together.This book could have been great if only the author had managed to break away from the problems that plague the genre. Give me a protagonist I can rally for. When it comes to the romantic aspect, don't lay it on so thick. And don't let your characters' ignorance get in the way of showing the logic behind the world you have created.Quote:""I learned the strange art of loneliness, the weathered yearning that swells and passes, and swells and passes, when you walk a trail alone.""While this book did get it's hooks into me, I'll be hesitant to continue with the series if I get the sense that it will just be more of the same. The writing was good, and the over-arching storyline is almost there, but this book ultimately doesn't distinguish itself from the bunch.If you found that you liked the themes and relationship dynamic, but were dissapointed in the same ways that I was, try Under The Never Sky. It has basic similarilies, but delivers what Eve fails to with more humour and better characterization.";1

214203;The strength of this novel lies in the possibility of life after death.  In the last few books that I've read, not by choice but by happenstance I keep running into this theme of immortality.  Of the fear of death.  What makes this novel different is that we get the fear from the perspective of Dawit/David who is immortal and is not afraid of dying but off his family doing so.  After he kills a child who now lies in a nursing home and then must kill his wife's friend a reporter who uncovers a clue about him and then Khladun, creator of the Immortals from the blood of Christ, we see how complicated immortality is.The concept of changing identities every twenty or thrity years is posisble to imagine.  But there are things that must be sacrificed.  Children, love, even to a degree notoriety because this is what ultimately starts unraveling David's cover, his notoriety in one life is flickering like a flame at the edges of his new one.Here's what I wonder, do the ties that bind African-American communities, the inter-relationships, ultimately put David at a greater risk?  Being not the majority percentage in America given enough connectability, isn't there the possibility that if not related in blood, most African-American are by story, by some touchstone?Is immortality particularly dangerous to David because he's passing for Black in a country where someone of his intellect and ability to pick up talents would stand out, much along the lines of &quot,the Talented 10th&quot,?  The book then brings us to another question, what are you willing to die and kill for?  And Ms. Due suggests that the easiest kills are the ties that bind us because there will come a point if we live long enough that they strangle.  It is only David's refusal to be alone anymore that brings this whole novel to the point of being worth a story.  What I really liked was that David is both hero and villain to his own family and ultimately to himself.  To love so deeply that he's willing to keep killing, even eventually his family to resurrect them, makes me wonder about the long terms effects of immortality and the wisdom of Khaldun keeping the Life Brothers to a limited number and hidden away.  Our emotions are irrational, our desires foolish and the lengths we are willign to go to for the silliest things our undoing.  Now on some level we all get and observe this in our daily lives but Ms. Due's book forces us to realize that without discipline we couldn't handle immortality, the burden of it the responsibility, the temptation to play God.  Because one of the abilities that God holds is over life and death and this beautiful book turns everything upside down when it asks what happens when we assume one fo God's powers.  It's a nice touch that the &quot,Living Blood&quot, comes from Christ himself, it both humanizes Jesus in a way that makes us think of him as pure down to his last cell and at the same time real.I also liked how these religious questions were raised, how Jessica's faith was challenged by the fact that suddenly the God she prays to is made real and a miracle is before her.  This could've simply been a horror story or a fantasy tale but by making her hav to confront her thoughts about God and the temptation to immortality, it really rang true as the kinds of thoughts a normal person in extraordinary circumstances would have,;1
145379;This book did a good job developing characters, but left me wanting for more plot.  The whole book and the main character is still in the academy.

436477;"I have loved everything written by Kingsolver until this book. It is surprisingly bad. First, I found the story was greatly bogged down by descriptive minutiae that did nothing to advance the story or enhance the characters. For example, in an uneventful and unending visit to the second-hand store everything is described to death. Next, the characters were not very likeable or believable- they felt highly contrived and their thoughts were annoying. The main character, Dellarobia, is constantly brooding over her own uneducated ""have not"" circumstances, daydreaming about cheating on her husband, constantly comparing items to what would be found at ""The Dollar Store,"" and in one ridiculous scene was in awe of talking to an out-of-stater who flew on an airplane (as people in her town never talk to those out of state, let alone fly in airplanes). The stereotypes were all there: truth-seeking scientists vs. ignorant country sheep- oh and of course the dirty, tattered hippie-types and know-it-all college grads. Lastly, the theme of the story is global warming. I feel Kingsolver really just missed the boat on this issue. This story would have been much more timely 10+ years ago.";1
375524;I really liked this second offering from Lecia Cornwall. The Price of Temptation starts off with a bang (literally!) and the action doesn't stop until the last word on the last page. Lady Evelyn Renshaw's notorious husband has been missing for some time, and it seems all the world is looking for the traitor. Of course, this means that they are also keeping a close eye on Evelyn herself. Living under constant surveillance, the disapproving clucking of her three sisters and the speculation of the Ton would be a bit much for anyone.Enter one Captain Sinjon Rutherford, disgraced military man trying his best to prove his innocence. He is planted by the Crown as a spy in Evelyn's household in the form of a footman. He is there to root out all of Evelyn's secrets, not fall for her strength and charm.This story was unusual in that a Lady of good breeding finds herself attracted to her servant. We all know that Captain Rutherford is no mere footman, but Evelyn does not at the time. I will say that I would love to read a historical romance where the Lady truly does fall in love with a man of lower class. If Dukes can marry their governesses, why can't the under butler get a little love? What's good for the goose and all that. But, I digress.Even though the villains' identities are laid out early on in the book, there is plenty of action and even a few twists in store. Though there were many obstacles that had to be overcome on both their parts, true love did win in the end.A very well written story with likable characters (discounting Evelyn's horrid sisters!) that had a happy ending for all.~Review by: Book Addict from When Pen Met Paper [...];1
449075;I really liked this book, although it has its dead spots.  The book plodded along for a while especially in the beginning.

But it really kicks into high gear in the second half, and from then on I couldn't put it down.Joe Hill consistently delivers quality stuff.;1
6875;When Scott says they abhorred and avoided the crime of unnecessary homicide, one can only comment that they seem to have found homicide necessary with appalling frequency.-The Steel Bonnets by George Macdonald FraserThis delightfully cynical line is one of my favorites of the book. It shows Fraser's sardonic personality as well as giving a healthy contempt for the romanticism of brigandage.In The Steel Bonnets, the author describes a world in which law was half broken, the sword was the ruler, and woe betide the weak. It is the old Anglo-scottish border. Long a frontier of war, people could not count on  normal guarentees of their survival. With civilization stolen from them, they became barbarians. And remained so for centuries. And the tales of their life still remain.The Steel Bonnets gives a picture of life on the border. It describes local customs, the techniques of raiding, as well as some of the most important clans. It is pleasingly unsentimental and does not regard border chieftains as heros simply because they were successful raiders. But it does give a fascinating portrait of their life. And it does not hide that, if border raiders were vicious, the English and Scottish governments, were not pillers of virtue either. It also gives a history of border politics and ends finnally with the brutal pacification of the region by King James, who as the author wryly acknowledges, was acting in a manner not dissimilar to his victims.The most attractive figure in the book was the Elizabethan lawman Robert Carey, who deserves to be better known, for he handled the difficult job of policing the border honestly, valiantly, and not without mercy.The Steel Bonnets is a book that is very much worth reading.;1
120988;Quite simply, this book changed my life.  After reading it many years ago, I went to college and grad. school, something I'd never even considered before.  That was 15 years ago, and I still read it yearly.  I've also wound up with an odd collection of motorycles over the years and many, many miles around the country.  I credit many successes and insights to this book.Despite my obvious bias, the book is well written and damn interesting.  It does get tiresome at points, and it does linger too long on some philosophies, but that's part of the ride.  Every trip has times when you just want out of the car, but it's always most rewarding when it's actually taken you somewhere.  I belive this book can.  There is a lot of hype and subculture surrounding this book, some merited and some not, but don't bother reading this or any other book for those reasons.  If you are looking for one man's way to discover self-actualization and his tragic burnout, this is a great read.  If you're looking for scripture, you should find it somewhere else.;1

240278;Finally! I've been waiting to get this book to continue the story of Seth and Aislinn and how they end up happily ever after! Not quite. Melissa Marr does it again with keeping you on your toes until the very end and keeps you wanting more than when you started. In this novel, we get a deeper look into Seth's mind and how he feels about Aislinn and her role as Summer Queen. We see his jealousy and insecurities that were absent in Wicked Lovely.We are also faced with how the relationship between Aislinn and Keenan changes as the Summer season approaches. This love triangle was stepped up a whole knotch which made me read this book at lightning speed. The character shifts were superb to witness and it really did keep you guessing until the last chapter. The way Aislinn tried to balance her mortality to be with Seth and her faery nature as Summer Queen was heartbreaking. She wanted so much happiness for everyone it was almost impossible to succeed. When Seth decided to take it in his own hands, the balance was thrown out of whack and worlds were affected. The character of the Summer King, Keenan, was greatly changed with figuring out how to keep his Summer Queen happy for his faeries and keeping his one true love at the same time. And the natural lust that between the Summer Queen and King tested boundaries only understood by the faery world, which created such confusion for all three main characters.I really enjoyed the story that Marr created for these characters. It was true to life in the fact that not everything is easy or free and you must be willing to trade anything for the one you love!;1
582580;This collection of writings chronicling Kesey's life in the decades following his dual notoriety as leader of the Merry Pranksters and one of the brightest literary lights of his generation is full of surprises.  Kesey pulls no punches in outlining how the golden dream of the '60s turned to ashes over time, with many of its symbolic leaders falling away.  He spares no one, least of all himself, in these pages.And yet, this is not a grim or depressing read.  Detailing with tremendous humor and gusto his journeys to China and Egypt, as well as offering poignant observations on the passing of personal heroes like John Lennon and Neal Casssdy, Kesey emerges as a fully realized person whose flaws only make him more fascinating.While Demon Box can hardly compare to a towering masterwork like Sometime a Great Notion, it is a deeply rewarding book.  One that can be revisited on numerous occasions with enhanced, not diminished, enjoyment.;1
597423;I am pleased to see that the reviews of this book are not uniformly rapturous. Given the awards that &#34,The Stone Diaries&#34, won when it was published, I expected more from the novel and, apparently, so did many other readers.  This is not to say it's a bad book, but just to say it's far from the best book I've read.The plot line, such as it is, follows an extended family building around a girl-woman named Daisy. The timeline is from the late 1800s until about 1980. The people live mostly in or near Manitoba, Canada, but also Bloomington, Indiana.  Several people have notable, small-scale accomplishments, such as developing valuable hybrid seeds, building a curiosity of a stone tower, or becoming a beloved local columnist.  These are great accomplishments, frankly, beyond what most of us will be destined to achieve.The story is told from inside the minds of numerous people in the family, as they overcome early obstacles and make their mark in the world. Several of them struggle in their early lives without love, and then in some cases, they find it with deep intensity in mid-life.  Others find mostly frustration and ultimately run from their disappointments (in one case, a wife leaving her husband in order to raise a dead neighbor's infant, and in another case a father returning to the Orkney isles at retirement age when he felt his sons had ignored him for decades).All these things are told with care and compassion.  My disappointment, however, is that there isn't much that's compelling. The epiphanies of people in the story are very bland: things like that you have to keep trying, or that you are alone when you die.  Some of the literary metaphors don't make any sense to me at all, they're just weird groupings of words.The best parts of the book are the letters that are exchanged by various people at various times of crisis or change. Sometimes, it's distant relatives or lovers. Sometimes it's avid readers of horticulture columns.  Sometimes it's children to parents.  All of the letters are interesting, insightful and often funny.  I think because they're more succinct than the descriptive parts of the book, they pack much more of a punch.There's a lot of weird sex discussions that seem out-of-place with the rest of the book, though i guess the author's point is that people always had sex, and it's always important.  But I find it hard to believe that there were these two couples in the late 1800s in which the husbands mounted their wives every night (the book says every night) for sex. And I find it hard to believe that Daisy's best friend Fraidy catalogued her 50-plus lovers and believed that sex was the closest you could come to experiencing the divine (remember this is in the 1930s and 40s). Just not believable.Similarly, the number of strange and early deaths stretched credulity a little bit. Daisy, the heroine of the book, is born to a mother who dies in childbirth. Daisy is taken to another city by Clarentine, when Clarentine abandons her husband because she's basically bored. She then dies when run over by a bike when Daisy is 11, so Daisy is reunited with her father, who literally never saw her from the time Clarentine left until Clarentine died.  Then Daisy marries in her 20s, but her husband falls out a window on their honeymoon, and he dies.  Sorry, that's too much.  Too much.;1

197534;If you're going to read only one book on Whitey Bulger's and Stevie Flemmi's strangle hold on the Boston rackets, this is the one.  The authors' investigative reporting goes deep, uncovering the gang's criminal activities as well as their unholy pact with the FBI.  This book lacks the personal notes found in others written by various gang members, but it more than makes up for it with solid reporting that shows the scope and outrageousness of the gang's operations.  My only criticism is that it could use an update covering what's happened to the major players since its publication.;1

24994;This is a great first novel by Fahy. Rarely do I read a new author and feel like I won the jackpot. This book was full of adventure and excitement. The creature sketches are a great addition to the novel also. The comparison to Jurassic Park is definitely appropriate. If you love adventure thrillers by such writers as James Rollins, Michael Crichton, and Lincoln Child, then you will love this novel. It has the right blend of adventure, suspense, and science, and it is my hope that it will be a huge success with the publisher rushing to print the next novel by Fahy.;1
577496;This short book is one of the founding classics of science fiction literature.  It details the story of a German scientist who comes across a map to a place that leads inside the Earth.  He puts together a crew, and of they go to Iceland to find the volcano that serves as the entrance.  From there, he and his crew journey into the Earth and encounter environments with their own plants, animals, geography and weather.  They collect samples, evade dangers, and have hair-raising adventures.  The group travels back to the Earth's surface, but lose much of the samples to prove their trip.The book moves along quite quickly, and has fewer dinosaurs and other animals than seen in the various movie versions.  Instead, the book focuses more on the internal dynamics of the group, and how they react to their discoveries, and to each other.  All in all, a book that is easily read in a couple of hours, and more worth the time than watching any of the movies.;1

413412;"One of the things I liked about this book was it gave examples of people's ""real life"" experiences.  Similar to religious experiences, while you can argue doctrine all day long, you can't argue with someone's personal testimony.  Ms Nickson's personal experiences can't be dismissed as simply a different opinion than so-called Progressives might have on this issue.  I also liked reading about the successes of other groups throughout the country.  As I read the book, there were times when a sense of despair at the inevitability of the collapse of America and the rest of the free world gripped me.  That despair is gone.  It has been replaced by a call to action. A call to me and to all who are not ready for the reintroduction of serfdom.";1
413960;I'm still trying to understand the culture that would treat people so horribly all in the name of saving face and looking good. It is hard to understand a society who holds such great store in family, will take in distant relatives, lives for the reputation of the family/clan name and yet will enslave their female children, give them away, drown them and treat them worse than animals, all in the name of building a strong future for the generations to come. Authors like Amy Tan and my favorite, Lisa See, have written about this same story many times and I still don't get it.Feng, the second daughter and first wife gives her first born away without ever even looking at the child. It is said that she does it as an act of revenge. I don't follow the logic. It would seem to me that living well is the greatest act of revenge for poor treatment. But my thinking comes from an American middle-class background, not a Chinese peasant married into a wealthy upper class family in place of her older sister.This story is a little bit limited in that most of it takes place in the family compound and there is not a great deal of historical explanation of the world events that caused some of the thinking of the main characters. One little thing that nagged at the back of my mind was a thread running through the story of how the grandfather taught Feng and ancient language. It was Latin and he taught his granddaughter and she her son, all the names of the flowers and shrubs in his garden. I have a degree in horticulture and would love to know how this man who was secluded in a small compound, where most people did not read and write, came to know Horticultural Latin.The conclusion of the story also leaves some loose ends. I did enjoy reading this book because I like the subject matter, however, it is not on my list of book to read again. Perhaps Mr. Jepson's next novel will be more complete. One feature I did like is the list of Further Reading both fiction and non-fiction, at the back of the book.;1

451482;"Boundaries for LeadersBoundaries for Leaders is the second book on boundaries that I have read from Dr. Henry Cloud. Rather than focusing on our own individual boundaries, this book looks at leaders and the boundaries needed within leadership. Dr. Cloud examines seven leadership boundaries throughout the book, ranging from helping others focus on what is most important, to creating thought patterns that limit negativity and helplessness. Basically, Dr. Cloud asks leaders to understand that boundaries are structures that determine what is allowed to exist and what will not. Each leader needs to be aware of what they will accept within their organization and/or team of people, and what cannot be tolerated. These limits need to be addressed up front and need to be clear to all involved. The leader has to set the stage for everyone. A team needs clear limits to demonstrate where the boundaries are, so that there can be no question of what is acceptable. Leaders need to be willing to establish these structures and stand behind them. The leader sets these boundaries and they determine whether the vision and the people involved will thrive or fail. The leader needs to be willing to take this responsibility. Leaders have to be willing to assume the role of motivator. They determine whether their people are motivated or not. It is essential for leaders to understand that as a leader, they will always get what they create and what they allow. If something is not going the way a leader wants it to, then he needs to be willing to take responsibility for changing it. This book talks about ways the leader can move from vision to reality. A leader needs to establish the vision for the people, and then help provide support for them to make that vision a reality. Leaders need to invest in people, as they are the ones in charge of building an emotional climate. They are responsible for the overall context of their place of work. The book continues by explaining how to set boundaries and take responsibility for them. It gives details on things like nonverbal clues, a shared purpose, and ways to keep everyone aware of the boundaries and the vision of the team. The book is insightful and straight-forward. Dr. Cloud includes personal examples and stories that keep the reader's attention, while building on the role of the leader. The book includes personal questions to mull over about leadership styles and methods. It also gives practical step-by-step advice to help leaders build up the climate and vision of their company. Overall, I found the book easy to read and follow, and it motivated me to take responsibility for the leadership roles in my life. I would recommend this book to anyone who has any leadership role, whether big or small, in their workplace.

178545;"When the front cover leads with ""The explosive follow-up to Freakonomics"" and when the authors claim in the introduction that ""this is easily better than the first"", you know you're looking at a Hollywood sequel.  Not that there is anything wrong with that.  The Godfather sequel outdid the original.  But you know to expect the same formula.  And that's what this book gets you.  I gave their first book an excellent review.  I protested that it lacked any unifying theme, even if it was an interesting hodgepodge of creative situational assessments.  In the introduction of this second book, the authors tell us that their publisher had taken similar issue with their first.  They now explain the common theme of their first book thus: people respond to incentives.  Forgive me! But that's like a book on science laboriously deducing that energy will always be conserved.This second book by the authors will certainly engage you.  They continue to dazzle with enlightening examples of unorthodox explanations for behavioral observations.  Other reviewers here have outlined the topics they undertake. I enjoyed reading the setup of each of their issues and trying to analyze it myself, before reading their assessment.  I did not take issue with their debate on climate change.  If it indeed is the biggest challenge facing mankind, we shouldn't be worrying about dissent or sacred cows.However, having grabbed the attention of millions with their first book, I think the authors missed an opportunity to push further with their second.  Here's one way:  Take on a complex topic, say climate change with all its externalities and global wrinkles.  Discuss an approach on how global policy might be structured, that would start with clever incentives and explore how to align them across the various constituencies and actors, getting them to respond to a common goal (unifying theme, remember?).  Now, that would have been a sequel worthy of this clearly talented author team and, in my view, more interesting than a polemic on this issue that dominates the reviews.";1

367059;Bass writes well and this book explores the shift from a kind of religion that is based on doctrine, dogma and domination by clergy to one that invites people to move from within rather than behave due to threats of punishment. Many people have moved to a higher state of consciousness in regard to  their relationship with the Divine, but the majority are still stuck in  the religious level of children and adolescents. Some pastors are happier when they stay there and can be controlled. At least that's my opinion. This book would be good for anyone who is thinking of or has left the church and has moved beyond to a more contemplative or even mystical level of religious experience.;1

540556;"I've been really looking forward to reading one of Haruki Murakami's books, and this is the one that particularly caught my eye. Murakami's stories and writing are a bizarre mix of realism and a fantasy world. In this book a young man named Toru Okada looks for his wife's missing cat. Eventually, he finds himself looking for his wife as well in a strange ""netherworld that lies beneath the placid surface of Tokyo."" He meets a whole group of strange characters, allies and antagonists. As the book progresses, it becomes harder and harder to tell what is real and what is not. This book had a great plot, and I really liked the narration of the book. Toru Okada tells the story, and he is matter-of-fact and observant. I look forward to reading more of Haruki Murakami's books in the future.*You can read all of my reviews at my book blog, novareviews.blogspot.com*";1

Who can resist Aunt Betsey (who was initially disappointed that David was a boy because she planned on naming a niece after herself - &#34,Your sister Betsey Trotwood would have told me what she thought of any one, directly. Be as like your sister as you can, and speak out !&#34,  Never mind that David never did have a sister, you know what she means.)  There is the verbose but endearing Mr. Micawber who constantly struggled with finances, but was always certain that &#34,Something would turn up.&#34,  And the villainous, Uriah Heep is masterfully described in all his writhing, false humility.  The list goes on and on.  If you'd like an introduction to Dickens' writing, this is the novel I would recommend.  I hope this book becomes your friend as well.;1
448424;"As Picasso famously said, ""Good artists copy, great artists steal."" And steal Hill does. There are shades of 'Christine,' 'The Dead Zone,' 'The Talisman,' 'The Shining,' and 'The Dark Tower.' Yet somehow makes it all his own. NOS4A2 makes very effective use of the time-honored literary technique of in medias res to put a hook in the reader's mouth. Then the story slows down into some moving character moments, and like a freight train going from a cold start, steadily builds steam until it hits you with an off-the-rails climax. Like the Avengers film of 2012, this is a small story writ upon a large canvas. And that canvas is a terrifying, nightmare America--an ""inscape."" My sense is that Hill is a very precise writer, that there's not a scene out of place, but that the book takes just a hair too long (especially in the early chapters) getting where it's going. Overall a thrilling read. I defy you to not root for Vic McQueen.";1
85546;Gambling and its legislation in the 1800s in London could have been a tantalizing backstage for her latest historical romance but Kathryn Smith, known for her sensual love scenes, instead concentrates on unraveling the mistrust and betrayal between former lovers bohemian gambling operator Lillith Mallory and parliament speaker Gabriel Warren. The playful mood of seduction wears thin to obscure the lack of atmosphere and depth in the lengthy read. Even Ms. Smith's passionate scenes fail to elicit the spark and chemistry between the characters who repeatedly falls out and reunites with sex in some sort of a vicious cycle. To add a dollop of intrigue and danger, Ms. Smith throws in a rival gambling operator who threatens her business and sends Lillith desperate for Gabe's protection. Ms. Smith redeems with a rousing ending to build up and impress with the altruistic Lillith and the gallant Gabe in their love for each other with obstacles of class and the demise of Gabe's father but it seems that Ms. Smith is only to content with a palatable plot to string the lovers together without much thought for the milieu and plot structure. This book thus languishes into a fleeting pleasure that fails to stimulate the heart and the intellect. Detractors may argue that it's an archetypal romance but a little more effort in detailing the historical period is deeply appreciated - and definitely worth the gamble.;1

I had a bad feeling, in the beginning of the book, when I started skipping paragraphs that were just too mundane and boring to the story.  A good book makes me eager to jump back into it, but with this, it's more like ""Do I have to?""  And I don't have to.  I hate to not finish a book, but when it becomes a chore to finish it, I need to cut my losses.";1
90135;You can rarely go wrong with Teresa Medeiros. Her books are the best of the romantic genre, tending to capture the reader within the first ten pages with a sensational scenario. Her heroines are smart, funny, and vivacious, her heroes are dark, romantic, and soulful, and when they meet, sparks fly!This latest novel, &quot,One Night of Scandal,&quot, seems to be a combination of Jane Austen's &quot,Emma&quot, and Emily Bronte's &quot,Jane Eyre.&quot, The heroine, Charlotte, or Lottie, yearns to be a writer but is bound by the time period (1825) to make a respectable marriage. Her curiosity gets the better of her to sneak out of her &quot,coming out party&quot, and spy on her temporary next door neighbor, Hayden Oakleigh, the &quot,Murderous Marquess.&quot, Hayden killed his best friend in a duel, and is rumored to have pushed his wife off of a cliff. He sounds very much a villain, but Lottie finds him to be a wounded man, haunted by ghosts not entirely of his own making.While this story could not quite rival &quot,The Bride and the Best&quot, and &quot,Thief of Hearts,&quot, it still captured me from beginning to end, and I gladly took the journey. I even cried at the end, which really surprised me.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a little romance. It's a quick, easy read, and will leave you with a lovely feeling.;1

336422;"Well, one caveat for that approval, my wife the history teacher, was offended by the occasional headline ""Lies my teacher told me.""  She would like to point out, teachers don't lie, textbooks lie and bad teachers repeat them.  Apparently good teachers find textbooks from three different nations and then discuss the biases of each account.But we both love this book.  We are leery of myth-busting-pop-history- bathroom-reading type books because they often get too snarky or they twist and distort facts for entertainment's sake (or worse, for an agenda's sake.)  So when my wife saw me reading this book, she immediately grabbed it out of my hands and flipped to her strongest historic subjects.  Immediately she said ""Aha, this isn't right!"" followed by a little more reading and, ""Well actually that is a pretty good description of how it happened.""  A half hour later she handed it back to me announcing ""this is actually pretty good, let me know when you're done."" (This is also where she pointed out that teachers don't lie.)I've had a real hard time putting it down since I received it.  The writing is humorous, occasionally chuckle out loud funny. Some of the humor comes from sarcasm and subtle jokes, but most of it comes simply from ironic historic truths.  Life really is stranger than fiction some times.As for the book's claim for near completeness, it is impressive. It covers a huge range of stories and keeps returning to subjects like fashion, religion, culture, economics, and of course politics through different periods of US history. From big to small it covers everything from King Phillip's War to hoop skirts to the invention of potato chips to things as obvious as World War II.  I am amazed at how much information the authors convey in short but concise snippets that are often barely half a page long.  The book is densely packed with information, but timelines, quotes, and sidebars break up the pages into delicious tidbits that keep you moving to the end of the book. For me there was not too much new material, but it was delivered so entertainingly I read it cover to cover in a marathon three days. I highly recommend it to anyone with a love of history or trivia.";1

195051;"Lene Gammelgaard wants to become the first Danish woman to summit Mount Everest, so when she gets an offer to do so from her friend Scott Fisher - owner of Mountain Madness, a company that provides outfitting and guiding services to climbers - she doesn't hesitate. She has climbed with Scott before, and she believes herself capable of reaching the summit of the world's highest mountain. Lene's varied background (psychotherapist and lawyer, among other things) will make her valuable to Scott as a team member, and Lene knows that's the case.Things don't go perfectly as the oddly assorted group moves through the weeks it takes to get accustomed to the altitude of Everest, get their gear carried up to the higher camps from which the summit assault will be launched, and determine which climbers can attempt that assault. Some succomb to medical problems, and one of the Sherpas - Nepalese tribesmen who for generations have made their living working for and with climbers on the Himalayan peaks - falls mortally sick, despite the Sherpa belief that altitude only affects outsiders. Eventually, though, Lene is among those team members who make it to the top. After which the hardest part of this climb faces her: she has to get down alive. Tragedy strikes when Lene and the other climbers who have summited on this day descend into a sudden storm of blizzard strength.This book was published in Denmark before Jon Krakauer's ""Into Thin Air"" was published in the United States. Krakauer, a professional journalist, was a member of Rob Hall's Adventure Consultants team, which by agreement between the two guides summited on the same day as the Mountain Madness expedition. The sudden storm proved to be a killer. Krakauer's book is one of my favorite pieces of nonfiction, but I've read the other accounts of the same events that expedition members who survived to tell about it have produced. All of them but this one...which gives me one more valuable perspective. I found it very readable, and very honest, too.--Reviewed by Nina M.

646937;While Jane Austen remains a beloved writer, Pride and Prejudice will always be the favorite.  This book has a lot of humor in its depiction of some of the characters.  I understand that this is one of Jane's early efforts and you can see parts of PAP in it.  It was originally going to be called Elinor and Marianne, the main characters of this novel, and maybe the name should have stayed that, as &#34,Sense and Sensibility&#34, is somewhat distracting.

131264;Another in the author's Victor Carl series. Here we find lawyer Victor waking up after a rough night out with a tattoo on his chest with a girl's name on it, trouble is he has no idea who she is or how it got there.....Victor is a bit of a mess, he wants to be a `player' but has not got a nasty enough streak to do it, so he lurches along wanting to make the jump to the big time, but some deep rooted morals keep him from the edge. In Marked Man, Victor is trying to re-unite a wanted man with his mother while trying to return a stolen painting. At the same time he is trying to find the girl whose name is on his chest and finds there may be a connection with his case.This is perfectly entertaining if a little uneven in pace, Victor is an entertaining lead character and the author also introduces some interesting peripheral ones. The plot is interesting enough although a couple of the twists were rather obvious. So while not one of the author's best, it's not bad.;1
142734;Out of all the editions of this book commonly available I have to admit liking this one the best.  It is the original Graham unfiltered by Warren Buffett or anyone else.  There is some great advice in the book but much of it is available elsewhere these days and much of it many experienced investors understand only too well after recent adventures in the stock market.  It is worth noting, however, that despite all the hype about Graham's being a buy and hold kind of guy, the book contains a Dow Jones timing strategy that the author thought the public might find useful in timing their sales and purchases of stocks.Anyhow, those wanting to hear this advice from the horse's mouth will enjoy this book better than the other editions.;1
598446;"Steven Levy's ""Crypto"" is a fascinating look at part of the story of modern cryptography, at least from the point of view of key non-government cryptographers.  The author clearly conducted plenty of research into the lives of certain individuals, such as Whit Diffie and Marty Hellmen, the RSA trio, and other entrepreneurs.  Unlike some other reviewers, I thought the text was lively enough and the book kept my attention throughout.  My only real concern is the obvious bias against the concerns of government cryptographers.  If you doubt the bias, it starts on the cover: ""How the Code Rebels Beat the Government - Saving Privacy in the Digital Age.""  Regardless, if you are a security professional or just have an interest in digital privacy, you will enjoy reading Crypto.After reading Crypto I felt a certain amount of gratitude to the non-government cryptographers who fought to put encryption algorithms and tools in my possession.  While reading the book a friend asked me to sign his PGP key, so I reflected that it would not have been possible without Phil Zimmerman's persistence and courage.  I also had lunch with Whit Diffie at a security conference just before reading the book, I wish I had read it first and brought the book to get it signed!My primary criticism is that the author too quickly dismisses the concerns of government cryptographers and security officials.  I agree with the idea that ""when crypto is outlawed, only outlaws will have crypto.""  However, our military, intelligence, and law enforcement entities truly do try to combat adversaries and keep the public safe.  Unfortunately, the DoD-CI-LEO triangle doesn't tell its story very well, or not at all, so I don't fault Levy too much for his attitude or coverage.I'd like to briefly mention three points that struck me.  First, on p 81 Ralph Merkle notes ""how the [academic paper] publication process was tuned to incremental improvements, but was very bad at handling something that is fundamentally different."" I thought that spoke volumes about the possible chilling effect of the peer-reviewed academic publishing process on ground-breaking research.  Second, on pp 127-9 the author describes Leonard Adleman performing a life demo to break the Merkle knapsack scheme in front of a crypto conference.  It reminded me of past Black Hat or Def Con conferences, where a speaker would show obtaining root access on a target, followed by applause from the audience.  Finally, I realized that much of the crypto wars were fought because interceptors feared encountering encrypted data in transit.  No one in the book considered the problem of compromised endpoints, where encrypted content must be deciphered in order to be useful.  Own the endpoint and all the crypto in the world is useless -- and that is how intruders of all types operate today.";1

177638;"""Buckle up, girlies.  Nothing is as it seems""The saga of Aria, Emily, Hanna, and Spencer continues.  Aria's family is in shambles, and her mother can't bear the sight of the daughter who withheld knowledge of her father cheating.  Emily struggles with her sexuality and trying to get her parents to accept her.  Hanna is falling out with her BFF, Mona.  And Spencer perhaps has taken one too many things from Melissa.These books have been marvelous fun to read.  They are wildly entertaining, interesting, and actually quite a bit creepy.  This book in particular kept me up WELL past my bedtime (and I had to wake up for an early flight the next morning!).Each girl has a vivid story.  Aria knew about her father cheating, but never told her mother.  Now, she suffers for that.  Sure, it's kinda weird to see a mother so antagonistic to her own flesh and blood, but I still think it is nice to see Aria's mother behaving as a normal human being--flawed and somewhat selfish.  Her relationships with Sean and Ezra are all over the place, and you totally won't expect how it ends.Emily was far more interesting to me this time.  She has feelings for Maya...but she can't show them, knowing how her parents would react.  When the secret comes out, Emily is threatened with either attending Tree Tops (a homosexuality ""reform"") or moving to Iowa with her super strict aunt and uncle.  Again, her aunt and uncle felt WAY overboard (keeping a list of sins?  Eating Cheerios to avoid sexuality?), but then again, there are some WEIRD people out there.  As for the conflict Emily has over family and Maya, it's very realistic and not all that unlikely.Hanna is still one of my favorite characters.  I really felt for her as she struggled to keep her relationship with Mona.  The poor girl has lost so much--boyfriends, father, her independence and confidence--that she can't bear to lose the girl who stood by her 3 years ago when they both made themselves over.And then Spencer.  What is revealed about her...again, this is the reason I stayed up way too late.  I love how her stealing comes to bite her in the butt, and I love the argument she has with Melissa.  All too often in books, I feel the characters really hold back in what they yell at each other.  Not here.We meet some new and old characters.  Ezra, Sean, Lucas (such a sweet boy!)...they all really grow and develop.  They refuse to be 1 Dimensional characters and feel like they have hopes, dreams, and likes of their own.  Even ""evil"" characters like Melissa and Meredith don't feel 100% evil.Of course, the amount of people in these girls' lives that aren't helpful--Aria's mom, Emily's aunt and uncle, Hanna's BFF, Spencer's parents--gets a bit over the top.  Can't they have SOMEONE to rely on?The novel ends on a cliffhanger, so if you are reading this series, make sure you have Book 4 lined up.  Fortunately, I do and I also have a nice 2 hour block of time while flying to read.  This series only continues to improve in my eyes.  I can't wait to find out what happens next!!Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*";1
190974;I am a 7th grader from Markham Place School. We needed to read a biography or auto-biography so i chose this one. I thought the book was very interesting. I loved it. Yes, it did have a few parts where you might not think it is very apropriate for a 7th grader to read, but it wasn't too bad. It's amazing how she seems to get over all her problems. This is a really good book. I hope you think so too if you read it.;1

253039;Although I will always be a devoted fan of the Big Stone Gap series, I did enjoy &#34,The Shoemaker's Wife.&#34, Trigiani's description of old Italy and America during immigration before the war was authentic and colorful. If you've ever had the chance to have parents or grandparents talk of Hoboken, N.J., Trigiani was spot on. This is a book worth reading to better understand the time period and get an idea of how the Catholic Church functioned, but you'll find yourself falling in love with the characters as well. A excellent family saga.;1

510409;Professor Monks has done an excellent job of summarizing and giving worked out problems for a very useful field of industry that is often neglected in pure and applied mathematics.  This neglect, especially at the pre-college level but also at higher levels, makes it harder for management and  operations research college instructors to convey the quantitative methods  to their students.  These methods are fascinating and include statistical  forecasting (with time series and exponential smoothing, correlation,  regression), statistical quality control, production scheduling and control  (linear programming, dynamic programming), manufacturing /service and  maintenance (queuing theory, reliability, simulation, calculus), budgeting,  inventory, etc.  I recommend this book for everybody in business for  themselves or for others and for students at all levels in order to tie in  their studies more practically with the real economic world.  In addition,  the more people are familiar with the methods, the less employment mistakes  will be made since so many of the methods interact with hiring, firing,  temporary layoffs, etc.  With more talent in the field, alternative methods  can be developed and tried (for example, present theory assumes that a lot  of things involve independent or non-influencing events, but a lot of  events are very interdependent and the theory needs far more development  there - see my review of Castillo).;1
386417;I am not quite through reading the book but I'm finding it to be very interesting and very well written.  I am about 5 years younger than Secretary Albright so I have hardly any memories of that time, but it was during my life so for some reason I feel compelled to study that period of time.  I think she has conveyed her thoughts and memories and done so in a sensitive way.  It bothers me to read how naive and trusting the people of Europe were and how easily they bought into Hitler's promises.  I guess most of them had no choice.  I hope we have learned something from history.  Never completely trust or believe promises and always be on guard.  It could happen again.;1
556589;At a clan gathering in the mountains of North Carolina, Brianna and Roger are finally married.Jamie is ordered by the Governor to form a militia of his tenants, which causes a sense of uneasiness among everyone.In the course of a minor conflict between the Governors militia and the &quot,regulators&quot,, who are the free settlers,trying to achieve independence, Roger is captured and hanged. Fortunately, Jamie and Claire rescue him in time, but the terrible injuries left on his throat, ensure that his singing days are over.Claire's knowledge of the oncoming revolution places her in a unique position, and she tries to prepare the colony at Frasers Ridge for the future, ,at the same time, using her medical skills to preserve the health and happiness of her family and friends. This book, although fascinating, wasn't quite as exciting as the previous 4 (although, how many adventures CAN be packed in?) and I'm sure that it's a stepping stone to book 6 and the revolution.;1
489158;I expected this book to be just another angsty romance novel about a hot, tatted up bad boy and a nice girl. Boy, was I wrong! This was a story about two very dysfunctional families: one that experienced the tragic and sudden loss of a loved one and how that loss affected every single one of them. The other family was too ensconced in their power, wealth, political connections and keeping up appearances to see that their child was suffering and had been for a very long time. In this intense family drama about owning up to actions and opening up hearts, there was a lot of misplaced blame and anger, but there was also a lot of sorrow and guilt that resulted in a total breakdown of a family. Blinders were put on, misjudgments were made, secrets were kept and hearts were shattered. Despite everything though, two people who weren't shown much love growing up, were still able to find love and give love to each other. It was a beautiful thing!;1
578292;I've seen several movies and television shows that cover the Titanic, so I thought I had little to learn from this book.  I was surprised that there was information in this book that I had not heard before.  I also enjoyed matching the things I read in this book to the movies I've seen.  I really enjoyed reading this on my Kindle.;1
292306;I may have gone into this book with a bit too much anticipation, in hopes of juicy family secrets, lies, twists and turns, but in the end I was let down.  Every time I picked up the book I was expecting an ascend towards a climax, but it never seemed to come.  Despite the reference of money in the title, the author seems to use it simply to tell the story of a run-of-the-mill Jewish-American family, money or none.But it was the simpleness of the family, the quirkiness of the characters and the peak inside Jewish daily traditions that kept my interest.  It was an easy read, but not something I would pass on to a friend.;1
270467;"I was rather surpised by ""Chicago,"" because it's really more about Eygptians immigants and students than it is about the city. Al Aswany has put together an interesting number of stories that run concurrently through the book, each emphasizing different aspects of the Egyptian-in-post-9/11-America experience. One man goes so far as to lose his Egyptian accent and become an expert in baseball, another wants to overthrow the Egyptian government and hopes to use exiled Egyptians as his followers, another has escaped anti-Coptic sentiment to become a celebrated heart surgeon, and a top student meets a repressed Islamic woman and they fall into a tortured relationship. In another chilling story, a man, posing as a Ph.D. candidate, works with the secret police in Egypt to feed information back to his homeland on the activities of Egyptians around him.I can't say that every story works. The one in which an Egyptian man's daughter becomes a drug addict doesn't ring true. I think Al Aswany hasn't spent any time around addicts to really understand how the disease works. I also didn't believe much of the love relationship between the Islamic couple. They kept trying to find excuses for their sexual activities in the Koran and it didn't make much sense to me. Also, there's a story about a black woman who can't get a job just because she's black. Racism still exists, but this is seriously dated. Laws prevent employers from doing what the author describes. Al Aswany, in his intro, also has bought into a lot of the discredited folklore about Chicago--even mentioning that Mrs. O'Leary's cow started the Chicago Fire. Most schoolchildren know that's just a folk tale.However, the bulk of the book speaks of an essential truth--the estrangement that Egyptians feel in a culture that feels sinful and yet strangely enticing. Chicago lures them to do things they wouldn't do in Cairo, and thereby the dramas begin. Although there are no endings to any of these stories, the reader can fill in educated guesses.This is a surprising and edifying look at the Islamic experience in America today.";1
278815;"As I read these reviews, I cannot help but noticing that most of them reek of political rhetoric in one sense or another.  I guess that is what makes me wonder whether a good number of the reviewers have even read the book!  Yeah, Morris is a former Clinton hack who appears on the FOX network ... so what.  What's lost in the mix is that Morris is smart, informed and most of all ... FAIR.  The only side this book leans to is that of the consumer ... whether Democrat, Republican, liberal or conservative ... I feel this book is beneficial to all.Aside from his guesswork as to what an Obama Presidency would bring in chapter 1 ... the rest of the book is devoted to how the average American is duped by the government (and its lack of governing) in almost every aspect of life.  But, the first chapter is important in that Morris believes an Obama Administration will institute policies that may have a negative effect on Americans.  Since the book was published before the field was even narrowed down to two candidates ... Morris' book has, so far, proven prophetic.  only time will validate chapter 1 of this book ... but the rest of the book is where the meat and potatoes are.""Fleeced"" covers a wide range of topics from the way our government is influenced (or even controlled to degree) by countries that hate the United States to Congress getting paid for a two-minute workday to the media deciding how much (or little) it wants Americans to fear terrorism. The topics are interesting and Morris presents them in an appealing, easy-to-digest manner ... there are plenty of juicy incriminating inserts/charts that that disclose names and dollar amounts.  Where Morris separates himself from the rest of the modern-day muckrakers is that he is not content with merely complaining ... at the end of each chapter/topic he suggests what can be done to fix or improve things.Worth its weight in gold, however, is the chapter on credit card issuers fleecing the public.  As a former banker, I found this to be one of the most honest, informative and blistering attacks on an entity that has become fat from eating off the gullible, ignorant and desperate American consumer.  Anyone that owns a credit card (most of us) can learn something by reading this chapter alone.  At the end of the chapter, you're even told what you can do to fight the credit card issuers ... really good stuff.If your looking for the book to bash one political party in favor of another, this won't be it.  Morris is clearly on the side of the American citizen in this one ... and he doesn't hesitate to tell you that both parties in government are guilty in screwing you over.";1

412194;The Lady Is A Vamp by Lynsay Sands is the 17th book in the Argeneau Vampire series.  I have been a fan of author Lynsay Sands for a long time now.  I have loved her books, gushed about the books, and even interviewed the author and characters on the blog.  When the newest book in the series arrived in my mailbox, I mowed everyone down that stood in my way to the reading chair and settled in for a few hours to devour the story.Paul Jones is on a mission to save his daughter.  She is dying of a brain tumor that is inoperable, and he is needing someone of the Immortal variety to save her.  After working for Argeneau Enterprise for quite some time,  he already knows about the secrecy and danger of what could happen.  After he finds himself drawn to the exotic Jeanne Louise, he decides that he needs to kidnap her and convince her to turn his daughter to save her.  He plans it out and makes his daring kidnapping using a tranquilizer that he has been working on for the Enforcer Group. After kidnapping Jeanne Louise, he brings her to his house and chains her up in his office.Jeanne Louise wakes to discover that she is having a hard time reading Paul.  She blames it on the tranquilizer and tries to figure out why she has been kidnapped.  While Paul doesn't treat her like a prisoner, she still realizes that she could still be in danger from him.  When Jeanne Louise finally figures out that she can't read Paul because he is her lifemate, she tries to figure out a way to make him fall for her and accept her as a wife instead of a tool to use for his daughters salvation.  She grows to love Pauls daughter as her own and wants to save her, but she can only turn one person in a lifetime.  She wants that person to be her lifemate as well.Oh Ms.Sands loves to pull at the heartstrings.  I was already sniffling by chapter two and by chapter four I had tears in my eyes.  Paul's daughter is so sweet and innocent and you can't help but wonder how this story is going to end.  As the two become closer and realize there is chemistry between them, the decision of who to turn is decided by an unlikely person.  This is where I was ready to blow up at the author because she brings in Bricker and he is one of my favorite characters.  Seriously, I have begged the author to include me as Bricker's lifemate when his story comes around, but I think she has me blocked now from all of the begging.  Anyway, Bricker feels horrible about the turn of events, and Lucien is forced to make some hard decisions for everyone involved.What I loved the most about this installment though was how the author brought the story back to its roots from the beginning.  Previous characters were involved in the story, the tender romance with witty humor was present, and the story flowed beautifully.  I felt like this story was one of the best books in this series since the earlier ones.  I really enjoyed it and it brought back that reading addiction that Ms. Sands can create with just one story.  I really want to go back and start reading the whole series now just to keep my Argeneau fix going!Another great book to add to your collection and one that will pull at your heart with emotions of love, sadness, and happily ever afters.;1
580910;Part of me really wants to dislike this book, but I just can't.  I can, and do, dislike Allie.  What a selfish man!  And what a compelling book if it can make me dislike a character this much.  The descriptions of the jungle and characters were so detailed and perfect!;1
520156;"I've now purchased three of the ""Michel Thomas"" CD sets based largely on the merits of a single set: ""Michel Thomas Teaches French."" Though I had six years of French in high school and college (where I was president of the French Club), I was rusty and needed a quick refresher. The Michel Thomas French set was exactly what I needed. In fact, the CDs taught me a few things about the French language that I had never known before.Based on my experience with the French set, I purchased ""Michel Thomas Teaches Spanish,"" and found that it wasn't nearly as good. It was okay, and it was still light-years better than Berlitz, but it lacked the insight and fluency of the French set. It wasn't hard to guess why: Michel Thomas was an outstanding teacher of French because he *was* French. He was a merely adequate teacher of Spanish because (a) he was a good teacher in general and (b) he was reasonably competent in Spanish.My third Michel Thomas set is Mandarin Chinese, a CD set from which the now-deceased Michel Thomas is absent. In his place, we get Harold Goodman, whose only qualification of which we're informed is that he studied language teaching with Michel Thomas. Goodman serves less as a teacher than as a moderator of the sessions, which also include two students and one native Mandarin speaker who demonstrates the pronunciation.Having had a semester of Mandarin at university, and having more recently worked through the first Pimsleur Mandarin course and the Oxford CDs by Kan Xian, I was eager to find out if the ""Michel Thomas"" course would be great like the French or so-so like the Spanish. On balance, I would say it's more like the Spanish.The set does have some excellent features. Most important, the Mandarin speaker enunciates the Chinese words very clearly, carefully, and slowly. Pimsleur, which I regard as the gold standard for commercially-published courses in spoken language, has speakers who say the Chinese words much too rapidly, at least for my ears. The speaker on the Thomas CDs, on the other hand, takes great care to make sure that you ""get"" each syllable and associated tone. Another good idea, apparently part of ""the Michel Thomas method,"" is to teach kinesthetic memory aids such as finger patterns to represent different tones. The fingering can seem a little hokey at times, but it's a sensible teaching technique.The Thomas CDs do make some simplifications in order to teach more effectively. For example, Chinese words have associated tones, meaning that variations in pitch determine the meaning of each word. The word ""ni"" (you) is normally pronounced with a falling-rising tone, as is the word ""hao"" (good). However, if two falling-rising words occur in sequence (as in ""ni hao"" for ""hello""), the first word changes from a falling-rising tone into a rising tone, while the second word stays a falling-rising tone. At least in the early lessons, the Thomas CDs don't mention that the tones of words can change based on the context. I'm sure that the authors made a deliberate decision to simplify the issue, because despite Mr. Goodman's offhand dismissal of the idea that Chinese is hard, Chinese is indeed very hard for Westerners. Its grammar of nouns and verbs is completely different from European languages - there are no verb tenses, for example - and the written language is not phonetic. The tones are probably the hardest part. Michel Thomas said in his own CD programs that his goal was not to make students fluent but to help them ""get the ball over the net."" With that goal in mind, such simplifications are a good idea.On the other hand, much of the charm of the original Thomas courses came from Thomas himself: crusty, irascible, occasionally frustrated, and most of all, Gallic as hell. Whether one likes Mr. Goodman's version really depends on how much one warms to Goodman himself and his thick New Jersey accent. I found his anecdotes and humor a little annoying, which diminished my enjoyment of the course: of course, such judgments are subjective. I also wondered if Mr. Goodman had any background in Chinese, even though the native speaker handled most of the Mandarin.Overall, it's a decent course for what it attempts. It provides much more hand-holding when it teaches fundamentals than does Pimsleur, but teaches (necessarily, at 8 CDs) a much smaller subset of Mandarin. If one doesn't mind Mr. Goodman, it's an excellent course to work through before graduating to Pimsleur or some other more advanced course.";1
492572;It's true: A lot of what Bradbury predicted for us when he wrote his classic Fahrenheit 451 about 50 years ago is becoming more and more eminent in today's world. Scary, yes?Books are on the decline, especially in our younger generation. Although a total ban/burning seems a little farfetched and unlikely, it is possible the public will lose interest in books year after year until there are no books being bought anymore... a sad day that will be.People are relying more and more on TV and other forms of &quot,entertainment&quot, ... some are filling, but most are rather empty. Are we destined to become mindless and frivolous like Mildred and Co.? If we keep on going at this rate, yes.&quot,Cliffsnotes&quot,, although they seem innocent enough, are on the rise. You can see cliffsnotes *replace* the good ol' classics in the classroom today, unfortunately (&quot,learn this classic in five minutes!!&quot,) A lot of today's kids are missing out on the great classics by reading only the material that leaves no room for their own personal interpretation...Children are killing each other, as Clarisse points out (&quot,I'm afraid of children my own age. They kill each other.&quot,) We have our fair share of adolescents murdering their own peers in the . How would Bradbury have known?Seashell radios - aka cd players, perhaps? People don't listen anymore because they're immersed in their own world of music. Not a good thing.All these (and more) got my eyebrow raising. Books that open your eyes and mind are rare gems. Although Bradbury's style might take some time to get used to - it took me a ton of rereadings and highlights to understand - this is very riveting, and I recommend picking up this book. Like my teacher said, your mind will not think the same after reading this classic.;1

523368;"There are several types of applications for content curation processes - my review is written from the perspective of a seasoned marketing practitioner.I believe that Steven Rosenbaum has compiled a comprehensive assessment of the topic in his book, Curation Nation. He calls curation the ""new magic"" of the connected world - fixing the signal-to-noise problem and making the world contextual and coherent again.Note, in March 2011 at the South by Southwest conference, I saw Mr. Rosenbaum present a summary of the findings of his research and extensive interviews that resulted in this thought-provoking book. He has demonstrated an in-depth understanding of why the future of content is applied context.The conclusion of his observations, analysis and compelling examples are very simply put - ""we are all curators."" He also says, for some it will be accidental. For others, it will become part of who we are. And, for a few of us, curation will become our livelihood.I had not previously considered the long history of content curation within the publication field. The example of the ""Reader's Digest"" magazine -- the well-known compendium of abridged articles -- is mentioned early in the book. In hindsight, it provided me a helpful conceptual foundation for the numerous other application scenarios mentioned throughout this book.Given my professional background, my view of ""why human curation matters"" was somewhat limited by my own experience. Mr. Rosenbaum's detailed explanations and varied case studies really helped to broaden my awareness of all the other potential possibilities.Chapter 5 is about Content Entrepreneurs, and it describes some of the more disruptive characteristics of curation applications today. It also sets the stage for a discussion of what constitutes ""fair use"" of other people's content - which is a contentious issue, for sure.It seems that achieving the most effective curation result is part Art, part Science and perhaps lucky Serendipity. This quote from chapter 7 is profound, ""creating unique, memorable content isn't a formula - it's a happy accident. In the same way, as publishers struggle to figure out curation, there will be a few leaders and lots of followers searching for the future economic model for content.""Andrew Blau's summary of the transformation aspects of content curation sums up the implications to the legacy publisher status quo, and particularly why big media companies don't like this emerging trend. He said ""What is clearly happening is that there are many, many more people speaking in public -- or some version of public -- without having to ask for permission, some of whom seem to be able to accumulate large audiences, some audiences the scale of traditional broadcast television or feature films.""In summary, this book is a current snapshot of this topic, based upon both historical and recent events. Once you've read it, you may want to conduct your own ongoing research. That was my take-away - I'm intrigued by this subject, and I want to learn more. I also want to enhance my skills in the area of content strategy development, within a marketing context.";1
484373;The charming aspect of the book is the way the story is told from the main character's after life.  This casts a mystical air over the entire book, but there's also much of history here too.With all that, this is also a romantic novel and will cast its spell on the ladies reading this.  Not that this book is just for women.  I quite enjoyed it and believe men will also find this worth reading.  All in all, I quite recommend this to all readers.;1

616851;At the end ofThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer, we left Huck Finn, now comfortably well-off, being 'sivilised' by the Widow Douglas. But when Huck's Pap comes back, wanting to get his hands on Huck's new-found wealth, Huck finds himself at his father's mercy, locked up in their shanty and subjected to beatings. So he hatches a plan to escape. Meantime, Miss Watson's slave Jim has decided to run away because he's overheard Miss Watson say she's going to sell him down to Orleans. When the two meet up they decide to throw in their lots with each other and set off down the Mississippi on a raft. This is the story of their adventures. (Please note there are some spoilers in this review on the basis that almost everyone will already know the story.)I am currently reading my way through some of the classics of American literature as part of a 'quest' on my blog to find the Great American Novel. There was always going to come a point at least once in the quest when I would hit a book that didn't seem to me to live up to its reputation. Sadly, this is that book. I'm quite sure that if I had read it not knowing of its status, it would never have occurred to me to rank this as anything more than a fairly enjoyable adventure yarn - showing its age, certainly, but with a fair amount of satirical humour.However, even reviewing it as an adventure, I found it compared unfavourably to its predecessor.  The few chapters at the beginning are pretty much a reprise of Tom Sawyer, with the gang again getting together to play at being robbers, and much of the humour here is simply a repeat of the first novel. The next section - Huck's cruel treatment at the hands of his father - is treated so lightly that it didn't generate any real emotion in me, and Huck's pretence at having being murdered in order to escape is again very similar to what happened in the previous book.Once Jim and Huck get together, the story improves greatly for a while and the first section of their journey is the best bit of the book, as we see these two unlikely companions begin to form bonds of affection and loyalty. It's here that Twain shows most clearly through Huck's narration the acceptance of slavery as an almost unthinking norm in the society he's portraying, and we get brief flashes of Jim as a real person when he tells about how he will be separated from his wife and children if he's sold.Then unfortunately the two con-artists - the Duke and the King - come on the scene and from there on the whole thing seems to lose any narrative drive. To be honest, while at first it seemed clear that Huck and Finn were heading north to the free States, after this mid-way point I had no clear idea what their plan was, if they had one. The book, like the raft, seems to drift aimlessly as we are given little humorous set-pieces at each of the towns they visit. But not humorous enough, I'm afraid, to compensate for the repetitiveness of the section nor for the overdrawn caricatures of these two characters.When Tom finally re-appears, the story picks up for a bit as they each take on false identities to fool Tom's unsuspecting aunt. But then we get to the long-drawn out and frankly tedious final section where, instead of rescuing Jim, Tom goes off into another of his fantasies and stretches the whole thing out to an extent where I found I was beginning to skim whole chapters in a desperate bid to get to the end.So as a novel, I'm afraid this would rate no more than 3 stars for me.Trying to look at it a bit more deeply as a contender for Great American Novel status, the two things that are most often mentioned are the innovative use of dialect and the satirical look at attitudes towards slavery. Certainly, the dialect is done wonderfully well - Twain never misses a beat, and makes each voice not only distinct, but an unmistakeable indicator of the different class each character occupies. So Tom's voice clearly shows he's of a better class and level of education than Huck, while Jim and the other slaves share a dialect all of their own - a dialect that is recognisable from most of the early Hollywood films portraying slavery, such as Gone With the Wind. This made me wonder if the dialect was authentic, or a Twain creation that influenced later culture. Either way, it's a virtuoso performance from Twain and certainly raises the artistic level of the novel. (Honestly, though, I found it irritating after a while - frequently having to re-read Jim's dialogue to catch the meaning. Perhaps that's my Britishness showing through.)I found the slavery question more complex, oddly because Twain makes it seem so simple. He makes the tolerance of slavery a universal thing, accepted unquestioningly by everyone in the novel. I found this unconvincing - the book is set only a couple of decades before the Civil War, and surely there would have been more shades of grey over it, even in the South, by that period? Also, although he shows the basic inhumanity and emotional cruelty of one man owning another, somehow he also shows the owners as fundamentally good-natured and mostly quite kind to the slaves. I'm sure that was also true of some owners, but I'm equally sure there was a lot more physical cruelty and abuse than this novel suggests. It all seemed strangely sanitised, especially since the point was presumably to show the plain wrongness of the practice. And, while there's no doubt every character in the book regardless of colour is displayed as, shall we say, intellectually challenged, the slaves really do come off as almost terminally stupid. It felt almost as if Twain was really highlighting something more akin to animal cruelty than endorsing any suggestion of true equality between the races, and as a result left me feeling quite uncomfortable. I really, really wanted Jim to tell Tom and Huck to grow up and stop messing him about, rather than to continue metaphorically wagging his tail at his masters, as he did even once he discovered that he had been a free man, while Tom indulged his own selfishness.Hmm..I'm guessing you can tell I wasn't convinced by this one...sadly, for me, it doesn't achieve Great American Novel status.;1

319090;Okay, while I love, love, love Kat's series, I didn't really like the last book (Mancheres) in the off shoot of Kat's series.  But this one was great! I just loved the heroine's issues and how they meshed so well with the hero's shtick.  Also, the hero is such a great combo of arrogant, bad-assedness that made this such an enjoyable read.  I tend to go more for alpha guys but he really worked for this story.  Can't wait for the next book.;1
473487;This was such a beautifully written and well told story of rebirth and facing our fears. Cassidy' s story was one of unbelievable torture, and my heart breaks for her and for what she had to endure her whole life at the hands of her mother the one person who was supposed to love her and care for her unconditionally. She only has Tyler, a boy her one age, that takes care of her. She has no one to save her...until Gage! Her whole life changes when she meets Tyler's cousin Gage and moves to Texas, and her journey to learn to live from ashes begins. This was such a beautiful story!;1
276828;what a refreshing, reflective, and clever piece told by a dog.  who could ever imagine that the perspective of a dog could be so sensitive and so acute.  garth stein has got some major creativity and  talent!!  this is a story that gives the reader hope that there is life after life and that good will always outweigh evil in this world--even dogs know it.  i loved this book!!;1
37982;This final book of the Divergent series is a rollercoaster ride. So much happens from the very beginning and there isn't much time to stop and think- for the characters or the reader. This book more than the others show Tris and Four's true colors. It's a difficult and great ending to an intense series. Not everyone will agree, but even in fiction sometimes the story needs to remain real and true. It will be interesting to see how these stories play out in the movies. I'm sure they'll do Tris justice.;1
499449;"For someone who's been around the self-help block several times, ""The Secret of the Shadow"" offers information and tools that are useful and make sense.  The idea that much of what I tell myself and others about the events and incidents of my life is not necessarily true, but instead is just a ""story"" has been powerful in my life.  With this new perspective I've learned to step out of the limitations of my story at will, along with the excuses, and rationalizations I've made up to justify any circumstances I don't like.  I now have the ability to instantly shift the way that I feel about and respond to situations, by simply choosing to interpret them in a different way. That's what I call useful!";1
4825;The whole middle section of the book (about 400 pages) could have been edited out, which would have left room for more exciting final chapters. Martin seems to favor a flurry of plot twists at every book's finale, which is fine--but this time even these felt half-completed. Hopefully he'll listen to reviews and get a new editor for the next book.;1
110608;I have been reading the deb series and like all of them.  Mother & daughter make a great team solving mysteries.  This book lived up to expectations.;1
212942;Dorothy Sayers is always a good read. Adding Lord Peter makes her books even more fun and interesting. No wonder her books are classics.;1
360202;I learned so much more about endurance although I bought this book to learn about cold water survival (although three did not survive) because I recently read a book about the famous actress Natalie Wood who did not survive her night in the Pacific Ocean. She was also wearing a down jacket as was Nick in his ordeal. The coroner in the Wood case claimed that down jackets sapped her strength and ended up killing her but author Rulli in Goodbye Natalie Goodbye Splendour proved in her own test that down jackets are not only bouyant but also serve as an insulator, and she has been ridiculed by commentators over her findings. This book, Not Without Hope, supports Rulli's test, and I appreciate that Nick delved into all components of his ordeal.These fascinating survival stories leave me in awe of the courage of those who struggled to survive, in grief for those who did not survive, and a definite fan of anyone brave enough to relive such an experience through a literary experience.How touching that Nick thought of his mother, how she helped him to find strngth in such a devasting situation. Author Rulli surmises that Natalie Wood thought about her two daughters, and I have no doubt that focusing on loved-ones is what is responsible for many survival stories against all odds. To Nick: thank you for your book, it is appreciated, and I am glad you are here to tell it. I am sorry for the loss of your friends.;1
423813;This is definitely a great book. I recommend this book to people who have read the WARRIORS and SEEKERS series. I also certainly can't wait for the  next one to come out!! Hope you love this book.  :);1
79113;I honestly have no idea why so many people liked this book. I saw how many great reviews it got, and decided to try it out, almost positive that I would love it. Wow, was I wrong!The biggest problem of all is the author's writing. This book has more intervals than I can count where I really had very little idea of what was going on, and I was extremely bored reading it. It's true that Garth Nix had a new and intriguing idea about death- the bells of Abhorsen were very neat, and the contrast between Ancelstierre- which is very much like a modern land- verses the Old Kingdom, where death walks freely- was different. If only the author had actually explained it all with decent writing and a good plot, I might have liked the book.I can't even say whether I think that the characters are dull or not, just because they were barely even characters. I didn't think that Sabriel even had a personality. I nicknamed her the Ice Queen, because that's just what she was- cold and unfeeling. The author tried to throw in some evidence about why she might be this way, that her father was never around and that Sabriel never knew her mother. However, then she'd have these emotional outbursts at different intervals, making the reader think that she is an emotional person. That was very confusing.The character of Mogget, who I nicknamed maggot, was strange, too. He's Sabriel's friend, or is he? Does he want to protect her, like he tries to during scenes where Sabriel battles death creatures, or does he want to kill her, like he tried to after she crashed the Paperwing? That wasn't even explained. Pretty contradicting material, if you ask me.The romance between Sabriel and Touchstone (odd name, I know) at the end was fake and forced. I try to ignore it because that was what made me decide to write this review, to warn other readers. I haven't read Lirael or Abhorsen, and you'd have to pay me to do so.There was also some material in this book that didn't fit the plot of the story at all, meaning it wasn't necessary nor was it really appropriate. At one point the author describes Sabriel's breasts, and when Sabriel meets Touchstone, hey! The man is naked, and she doesn't mind taking a few peeks. Not really apt for the audience.I'm not going to lie to you- I really don't feel that this book should be recommended to anyone. The only scrap of a good thing I can say about it is that the idea of crossing into the dead, and the nine gates, is an interesting one. However, I still don't understand many things because the author was so vague about it. I still don't really know what a Moridcant or a Shadow Hand is. It was almost as if he expected you to know everything about the dead world. Gee, sorry to disappoint.I can't see why so many people rave about this book. Either they like to read about confusing topics that true, are unusual and interesting, though clearly undeveloped, or I was missing something as I read.;1
134386;A thought-provoking read which pushes the envelope on logic and reasoning and economics.  The audio version is a good one with co-author Dubner as reader.  As a side note, it is also interesting to compare the authors' premises set in 2006 (the book's publishing date) to today's world (2013).;1
383980;This is my first time reading anything from this author and I have to say I'm impressed. As an avid reader I will certainly add her to my list of favorites.;1
407636;This one had a few twists and turns that were unexpected.  It takes place all over Europe, Israel, and Russia.  All the usual characters with all the usual problems but this time there are a few new ones.  This one makes Gabriel seem more emotional and sympathetic--perhaps an evolution is coming?;1
447819;I really enjoyed this book....despite the rather overbearing religious tone near the end.  Life in the coal mining towns with racism and prejudice rampant it was amazing just how tolerant people could be.  And the women so brave under difficult situations.;1

527329;This book got thirteen chapters covering 4Ps, marketing research, consumer behavior, market segmentation, integrated communication, distribution, personal selling, pricing, marketing of services, and global marketing.There are four sections of cases, from short one to in-depth study.I use this book as a college-level course.  Final projects were done using these cases.  Students like the book.The book will be better if it includes fewer cases, but more thorough analysis of the cases.Contrary to other critics here, I believe the book is very good.;1
149242;"Harewood Tech is just like every high school. It has it's pretty and popular girls, it's nerds, it's drama geeks...everyone, really. Except it has one extra group. The Defiled. At Harewood Tech, being Defiled is the worst fate that can befall a girl. It happens when, someone (no one knows who), posts a girl's picture in the bathroom with the letter ""D"" on it. From then on, that girl is a social leper. Because, of course, everyone starts to ignore and shun her.The horrible act of defiling has gone on unchallenged for a pretty loonnnng time. That is, until Sherman Mack (a geeky, yet original, freshman learns that his crush, the beautiful and nice, Dini Trioli(despite the fact that Dini will neverever see him as a potential boyfriend..), might be next up on the list to be Defiled. And of course, Sherman doesn't want that to happen.All it takes is the urging of his good friend, Vanessa, and Sherman Mack is investigating the who, the what and the why behind the Defiled.I've always been kind of iffy with authors writing in first person from a perspective of the opposite gender of themselves. Oftentimes, it just comes off as completely and utterly unnatural. However, in Getting the Girl, Susan Juby's Sherman Mack is hilarious, realistic and completely easy to relate to. He's quirky, funny and as he relays the story of this investigation, he leaves nothing out. Even his fantasies about random female characters in the book.The story idea itself, well, it's pretty terrific. There are many books on the hierarchy of high school, however, I think this one is one of my favorites. The problem is tackled uniquely and hilarity ensues along the way. I was laughing out-loud as I read Getting the Girl!Along with Sherman Mack, Susan Juby's cast of characters is widespread and varied. Sherman's mother is a bartender who has a thing for burlesque dancing. Definitely not your typical mother...His friends, those he has and those he meets along the way, all add extra flavor to the book. From the Trophy Wives that he befriends (or who befriend him) to his friend Vanessa, every single character is vital to the novel. Sherman's developing relationship with Vanessa is particularly interesting to read about...I really don't have any qualms at all with Getting the Girl! Buy it, now!";1

Only, now violet seems to be the target of an unpredictable situation and her close encounters will murders makes violet all that more noticeableI liked Violet a lot better in this book, he whole demeanor and personality shifted back to how it was in the first book. I absolutely loved the awkward relationship between Violet and Rafe. I did want to see more of their relationship progressing, although it did get pretty perfect for a second, and I also wanted to see a little more of Jay.This story line is great and thrilling. The suspense is almost scary in execution. I think the author does a really great job of being able to get into the killer&#8217,s mind to, with the little glimpses the reader gets.Overall, I&#8217,m crazy about this series. On to the next!;1
491054;I have tried to write this review many times before but I just couldn't seem to do it. Not because it wasn't good, -- I think Tease was an amazing book but because it dealt with a topic that is just so hard to read about.Tease is from Sara Wharton perspective, one of the bullies of Emma Putnam who by the time we are reading has already committed suicide. Let me tell you it was really hard reading a book from a bully&#8217,s point of view, from their life. But I learned while reading Tease that bullying doesn't just effect the victim but effect so much more.I am not condoning bullying or bullies in any way but Tease is able to make the reader see not just victim's perspective but from the perspectives of everyone else.Sara is, well, I think manipulated. Yes, she does bully Emma on her own account, but I think that deep down, she is actually being bullied herself by the manipulation of her &#8216,best-friend.&#8217,Tease was a very hard book to read, but, like I said before, not because it was a bad book, but because of the subjects it deals with. There were a couple of times where I had to put the book down and just recapture my thoughts and feelings because sometimes it was a lot to take in.I felt bad for Sara. What she did was horrible, but she had to deal with the consequences on her own. I felt like she was a pawn in a chess came. She was used as the mover. She did everything, but with the influence of others. Yes, no one can make you feel something, but they can change your feelings towards something.Sara&#8217,s best friend wow, now she is a bully through and through. She was the puppeteer and Sara was the puppet.A lot of people don&#8217,t like Sara at all, but I think there is much more to this story than what is really displayed. She is just so &#8216,weak,&#8217, you could say, she doesn't understand that what she says hurts people.I like how Tease went back and forth from the present to before Emma&#8217,s suicide. It gave me an insight on who the real bully was. Not just what is on the outside. It also gave us an idea of who Emma was and how she acted. What happened to her was horrible, but she also did some pretty bad things herself.The language used in Tease is a bit out there and, from other young adult books that I have read, it&#8217,s one of the few that uses that sort of language. But then I realised that the language that is used by almost every teen and it&#8217,s normal. It may not be nice in anyway, but it&#8217,s real. And that is exactly what Tease is: real and rawTease was hard to read, but it is so powerful. How one little thing can lead to another little thing and then something big. How one mistake cannot just ruin your life, but the lives of those around you.;1
600160;This books moves from a great grandfather's loss of faith in Paterson, New Jersey, to a Waco-like incident.  Unfortunately the Presbyterian minister, Clarence Wilmot, is much more lifelike than the subsequent characters living in Delaware and New York City, among other places, upon whom the author expends a considerable number of words and much labor.Clarence Wilmot explained that he would be with the members of his church only for the length of his call.  He had come to believe there was no God.  At Fourth Presbyterian glass windows presented a sextet of Protestant martyrs, Wycliff,  Huss, Calvin, Knox, Cromwell, and Bunyan.  A dying parishner told Clarence there had not been enough damnation from the pulpit.  Clarence had a wife and three children.  He thought that if he resigned the ministry there would be jobs.  He thought it would be hypocrisy to remain in the pulpit.  When Clarence tried to give his resignation, the church leaders offered an August vacation at Ocean Grove.  After he was demitted he fell on the social scale.  Previously he had failed to grasp such a consequence of his actions.  Three years later he was selling encyclopedias door to door.  His son Jared returned from World War One with a limp arm.  Younger son Teddy survived the influenza epidemic.Following Clarence's death, Teddy and his mother moved to Delaware.  Teddy obtained work in a bottle cap factory and later became a postman.  He had his wife Emily had two children, Esther and Danny.  In the nineteen fifties Esther moved to New York City to jump start her career as an actress and model.  Eventually she did become successful in the movies, and it was her son Clark who joined a peculiar sect.This intergenerational novel certainly has its moments of rollicking good spirits.  The portrayal of members of the family with a myriad of interests and competencies is energetic.;1
432406;"THE HERO'S GUIDE TO SAVING YOUR KINGDOM is a delightful twist on the fairy tales you thought you knew.  I read this hilarious adventure novel to my 7 year old daughter, and she and I both laughed out loud many times.  If you like you fairy tails fractured, your humor off beat, and you adventures weird and wacky, then THE HERO'S GUIDE TO SAVING YOUR KINGDOM.Have you ever heard of Prince Frederic, Prince Gustav, Prince Liam, and Prince Duncan?  No?  Well, neither had I.  But I bet you have heard of Prince Charming.  You see, Frederic, Gustav, Liam, and Duncan ARE the Princes Charming of legend, one for Cinderella, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White respectively.  But it seem that the bards of yore, who recorded their heroic deeds, got it wrong.  First, they had the audacity to make the tales of the princes heroic deeds all about the girls, and then those lazy bards couldn't even be bothered to get our heroes' names right, never mind the actual facts for each tale.  So our Princes set out on a kind of quest to restore their good names (quite literally) and restore their reputations.  And their ensuing journey shows us how wrong the bards really were.My wee one and I both loved THE HERO'S GUIDE TO SAVING YOUR KINGDOM.  Full of wit and nonsense, hilarity and quirkiness, trials and tribulations, THE HERO'S GUIDE TO SAVING YOUR KINGDOM kept both our interests and kept us laughing.  While this tale aimed at grades 3-7, I think it will appeal to a much broader age range.  Most of the humor was enjoyable to my precocious 7 year old, while keeping old Mom entertained as well.  The plot is zany and fun, and unique enough to keep us guessing.  And, IMHO, the ending hints at a possible sequel.My young one's favorite line from THE HERO'S GUIDE TO SAVING YOUR KINGDOM, which she is still working into every conversation, and is still making her laugh hysterically is ""Look, Frederic is a big goober, and makes me feel like I'm going to sprain my eyeballs from rolling them so much, but he is a good guy.""  For her, this is an extremely memorable quote, and THE HERO'S GUIDE TO SAVING YOUR KINGDOM is peppered with these original witticisms.  Overall, THE HERO'S GUIDE TO SAVING YOUR KINGDOM is just plain fun.THE HERO'S GUIDE TO SAVING YOUR KINGDOM takes the classic fairy tales and turn them on their ears.  Prince Charming (none of them), the Princesses, and their stories are certainly not what anyone thought they were.  But, for my daughter and me, they were even better!";1

596116;"Having read previous books on Western Zen including the author's biography of Suzuki and ""Shoes Outside The Door"", I was already familiar with the history of the San Francisco Zen Center and read this book primarily to learn more. ""Thank You And OK"" is a good personal account of travel in Japan but that is not why I read it. I'm inclined to take Zen students seriously so I consider the ""An American Zen Failure"" part of the title to be false modesty. I don't see why anyone would meditate for years and become a Buddhist if they didn't get it.On the other hand, Chadwick chose to write a humorous travel journal and only occasionally goes deeper into the Zen experience. It may be that he was writing with a particular audience in mind but it seems too guarded concerning one's inner experience.But since trying to judge the depth of another's spiritual gifts is pointless and unworthy, one of my criticisms of Zen, I won't continue. American Zen needs to adopt an American character and stop looking to Japan for inspiration. Maybe we should drop the Zen altogether and just graft a few of its insights onto good old American Transcendentalism, although that is not entirely home grown. Personally I have no problem weaving American culture into my spirituality since the unconscious mind naturally weaves experiences into a significant personal mythology.";1

406261;"Author Charles R. Kesler takes a very intellectual, sometimes caustic philosophical look at Barack Obama and the liberals in his book ""I Am The Change"". That title belies the fact that, despite the author's early statement, it is also a trenchant treatise on the history of Liberalism, tracing it back to the end of the 19th Century and then tracking Liberalism as it advances forward in 'waves' towards its current status under the likes of Barack Obama, the Clintons, Reid, Pelosi, et al. He begins with the ""Audaciity of Barack Obama"" examining the background, early influences, political motivations, successes and failures, current goals, and future political probabilities of Barack Obama and his philosophy. Dr. Kesler draws interesting parallels between Obama and Martin Luther King, and gives a highly effective dichotomy between the Grant Park of the raucous, riotous anti-war crowd outside of the August 1968 Chicago Democratic National Convention and the ""well-mannered pandemonium"" of the crowd in Grant Park at the Obama victory speech on Election Day, four decades later. But then he gives us riveting chapters on the eras of Woodrow Wilson and the Progressive Movement (he even backs into the 19th Century for an excellent look at the genesis of the Populist Movement), Franklin Roosevelt's weighty New Deal influence, and Lyndon Johnson's Great Society era. Along the way we also meet the influence of Rousseau, Hegel, Darwin, and others. Although sometimes falling prey to the litany of Republican 'talking-points', it is when the author breaks free that the analysis becomes historically enlightening, very thought-provoking, and truly challenging to the progressive way of thinking. Liberals and conservatives alike may find this book informative and stimulating from a more conservative point of view, if only from the standpoint of apologetics for liberals. Very Definitely Recommended. Four THOUGHT-PROVOKING Stars! (304 pages, reviewed in Kindle text-to-speech and text)";1
63795;"I was never aware of ""Flat Stanley"" while growing up.  My wife recently purchased this book for our second grade daughter through her school book program.  It has quickly become a favorite of my daughter.  She reads it and both my wife and I have read it to her at night as a bedtime story.  The tale is very engaging and Stanley Lambchop's adventures in flatness are funny, even for adults.Stanley tackles being flat with a positive outlook.  He takes on criminals, saves a ring for his mother, helps his brother fly a kite and has a few more hilarious flat experiences.For anybody with a young child in grades K-3, this is an excellent storybook.  The illustrations are excellent and funny and the story is simply wonderful.  Highly recommended.";1
522389;"I have been tutoring kids in ACT and SAT and used this book for beginning the ACT process.  It is definitely easier to get a 33-34 on this test than on the real thing but you can resolve a lot of timing issues and get familiar with the format with this.  After some point the student using these tests the student should be pretty good (31-35 on these) and then it is time to go to the real thing with ""The Real ACT Prep Guide"" or some of the sample tests from the ACT web site.  There will be a drop of about 5-10 points in scores but the timing and format issues will be resolved and the confidence has risen from seeing the improvement in the ""made up"" tests here.  These are important issues and worth the investment in time and money since the real tests are in short supply.The science questions are easier in that the real test often requires looking at relationships between two charts, or a table and a chart, where this book only asks for interpreting one table, passage or chart at a time. Many people have trouble reading tables or graphs so getting familiar with them is a good thing.What I do is go over every error with the student that they made on the sample test, make sure there is complete understanding, make up some similar math problems, or similar questions related to the reading or science passage, and show what the underlying method is to answering this sort of question.There is no reason to need a tutor like me if the student can fully understand most of the answers to the tests, stay on schedule (like doing a test a week or whatever time allows), make up (or find) similar problems to get practice and figure out the short cuts.  That many people cannot do all of the above is what keeps the tutoring field alive.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the tests are too easy, and there seem to be about 1-2 errors on each test which is not enough to worry about.  So use this book, keep to a schedule, go to the real ACT book when you have a good score on these, and make sure you understand the answers.";1
41950;I just finished reading this yesterday.  Over the last few weeks I've read the entire Song for the first time.  Generally, I believe that even though this isn't the best book of those published so far (perhaps because he had to split the volume, but considering the time it's taking to release the other half, that seems to be a fairly empty excuse), I do believe that it is still a fairly good work that continues the story for a good set of characters in Westeros.The main characters are progressing and have interesting plots, and it's starting to blur as whether the bad guys are really all that bad.  Exceptions like Gregor, the Companions, etc. are clearly bad, but are the Lannisters really so bad?  Is Jaime's reputation really a misunderstanding?  And even though Cersei may be bad... I certainly don't want her dead anytime soon, she's at her sexiest in this book.As good as a lot of the book is, there are parts where it becomes irritable with descriptions of places or things that just don't seem to matter a page later.  I even found myself dozing off a few times, which I never did while reading the first two books, and only a couple times with the third.  Not only was this downright boring in places, it was also in sufficient amount to affect how I rate the entire book.  But, I have a theory that may explain it, or at least put it in perspective.In each book thus far, imo, the book starts off interesting, slides into some a lot of explanations and foreshadowing, then ends on an interesting note.  Like each book, the series seems to be doing the same, A Game of Thrones was very interesting (Best so far, imo), and from there we're getting into a lot of explanations and foreshadowing, etc., you know to set up for the climax.  This being the middle of the series, as in the middle of the book can be boring, but you MUST read it to get the details and know the significance of things past and things to come.  There's no way around it, and thus this book does have importance to the series and should be read.It's really not as bad as some reviews have made it out to be, it's actually pretty good and has those cliffhangers and makes you wonder... what was the word she said?  she's blind?!?!  and more.I'm giving it 4 stars, only because 3 seems too low, 3.5 would be about right.(imo = in my opinion);1
262175;A Harper read (free in exchange for an honest review) and another venture into detective/mystery lit.  I do enjoy them from time t time, but will admit to being a bit of a harder sell than some since it isn't my go-to genre.  This is apparently the second in a series, although (as I find common and a benefit to the genre) it isn't at all a drawback to have missed the first installment.  The main character is a flawed female detective with a focus on murder investigations.  A rumor leads her to dig up part of a community garden, to the chagrin of leadership in her squad, and the unexpected result sends her hunting not only a killer but an unidentified victim.This sits between a 2 and a 2.5 star read (of 5).  I found myself intrigued about the victim but the story just dragged and got a bit too confused at times.  There were also too many coincidences, a definite personal pet peeve.  At times I found the detective character interesting but then she'd lose my interest and I felt like there were elements that got dropped.  I picked in up with interest in the early-going but was more than ready for it to end.;1

460420;"Almost everyone has heard of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes, whereas his predecessor Wilkie Collins has been relegated to footnote status.  However writers in the ""golden age"" of detective mysteries, especially Dorothy Sayers, were very aware of Collins and his influence.The Moonstone uses a clever device whereby the narrative is passed from hand to hand to tell the story of the massive yellow diamond called the Moonstone.  Ill-gotten spoils from colonial India, the Moonstone vanished for a generation until it was bequeathed as an 18th-birthday gift to Rachel Verinder.  The engaging characters who tell the story of the mysterious disappearance of the Moonstone on Miss Verinder's birthday, each with his or her unique background and perspective, kept me following the story until the end.  Collins also depicts the setting in rural England of Rachel Verinder's home town very effectively and without romanticizing.  Unexpectedly, the famous detective plays a minor and reluctant role.  In the end, I found the actual method of commiting the crime to be a bit unbelievable, but because I enjoyed the storytelling so much this was a minor quibble.";1
458763;I'm glad I ignored the bad reviews and read this book.  I'm still thinking of this book months after reading it.  I felt this book was realistic.  A man who thinks all woman should look a certain way, falls in love with a woman who is fat.  He tries to change her, but in the end he is more changed than she is.  Yes, she loses some weight, but after a while he has to admit that her body is naturally bigger and that she is still healthy.  Yes, the hero has a lot of learning to do, but I felt it was only realistic that he wasn't going to change overnight.  Even when he knows her body is only going to change, but so much he still wonders can there be more changes.  He is a product of his society.  A society that tells women they should only look one way and tells men that they should only love a woman whose body only looks one way.  It's sad, but what helped the hero grow was not only his love for the heroine, but her love for herself.  She didn't starve herself to look the way he might want or the way society wanted.  She was comfortable in her skin and that is something we can all learn from.  I hope the author writes more books with plus size characters.;1

11630;Wurts'latest book in the Wars of Light and Shadow series is, in a word, magnificent.After a somewhat repetitive period in the last few books that focused on the exile of Arithon and pursuit of his half brother, Lysear, Wurts has in &quot,Peril's Gate&quot, created a new scenario. This time, Arithon is not successful in his attempt to seek solace on the wide blue ocean. Instead, due to circumstances beyond his control, he is forced to stay on dry land. As such, Lysear is able to feel the pull of his half brother through the curse they share, and orders a relentless pursuit of Arithon.Peril's Gate moves paces ahead in the story of the two half-brothers. Wurts draws readers deeper into the troubles of the world and the roles the magicians play in saving it. In &quot,Peril's Gate&quot,, we experience the growth of Dakar the Prophet, soul-searching of Arithon, a renewed love for Arithon by Elaira, mysterious events that occur around Lysear's wife and son, and we learn more of Davien the Betrayer.The book is brilliant, pace-y and brings renewed interest and focus to Wurts' world. It is a step up and forward from previous dallying. It is darker, heavier, more serious, but all the more pleasurable to read.I can't wait for the next book, as we reach a pinnacle and pivotal point of the story of the Master of Shadow.;1
411076;Twice Tempted (A Night Prince Novel) by Jeaniene FrostVlad & Leila continuedWell, I could not wait to get my hands on this one.... ever since I read about Vlad in the Cat and Bones books way back when and  then reading the first in this series, Once Burned!  Now I feel let down, like it wasn't all it was cracked up to be.  I do adore Jeaniene Frost and her books, but this one didn't really do anything for me.  I would have thought after the means in which the first one ended and the amount of time we had to wait to obtain this one, that it would have blown me away... It did not!  It gravely felt like a vicious cycle or circle that just kept up a monotonous pace talking about the same old same old!  I felt like it was missing something that never ever came.With all that said above, I still worship Vlad more than any other vampire in this series.  He's merciless, cunning, gorgeous, mysterious, and above all The Prince of Darkness!  Leila should be so lucky for what was offered to her.  Come on, jeeze, really, you honestly turned that down!!  Tisk tisk girl!  I was glad to see the return of a few of our older characters from the Cat and Bones series, but the appearances were few and far between.  I believe the book would have been more significant and amusing had Cat, Bones, and Mancheres and Co. been more prominent in it!The book was 389 (kindle version) pages long and I found myself skimming a modest bit only because it felt like the storylines and circumstances kept repeating themselves and I felt like getting to the next scene for some potential changes.  It moved along at a rather sluggish pace, and get this... the story does not end here.  There will be more to come in this series.  So, we'll be waiting another year (maybe less) for the next installment.  I feel a tad bit angry that I already waited for this one, paid about 7 bucks for it, and I got a soso story that felt like it was rushed to the publisher!Not so many highs and lows and as far as the climax goes, there really wasn't any, for me at least.  It's not as much of a cliffhanger as it's predecessor, but it does conclude somewhat abruptly!  I do want to be clear on something,  Jeaniene if you actually do read your reviews, well, I would like you to know, this does not detour me from reading your books in the future.  I did not hate this book nor did I love it, but felt it was lacking something.  Not sure what!  3 Stars!;1
452933;DON&#8217,T CALL ME BABY is a sweet and funny story that every girl &#8211, whether a mother, a daughter, or both &#8211, can relate to. It&#8217,s a story with a positive message that lets readers see things from both sides of the mother-daughter divide. And while Imogene&#8217,s situation is a bit more extreme than most, the issues she and her mother face are ones that readers will be able to identify with.On first glance DON&#8217,T CALL ME BABY appears to be a story about a girl whose mother is self-absorbed, who puts her blog&#8217,s audience before her own daughter, and who doesn&#8217,t respect her daughter&#8217,s need for privacy. But as the story progresses, both readers and Imogene are shown that not everything is as black and white as it might seem. And that sometimes empathy, understanding and compromise are far more effective than drastic measures.Imogene is a mature and thoughtful young girl who is at the end of her rope when it comes to dealing with her mom. She&#8217,s ready to take a stand, even if it means resorting to using the same tool her mother does &#8211, her blog. And while she&#8217,s initially ready to do battle no matter the consequences, she soon has a change of heart.Gwendolyn Heasley has written a story that both entertains and gives readers something to think about. Interspersed throughout with hilarious, cringe-worthy, relatable blog posts from Imogene a.k.a. Don&#8217,t Dare Call Me Babylicious and her mother Meg a.k.a. Mommylicious, as well as Imogene&#8217,s friend Sage a.k.a. VeggieBaby Fights Back, readers will laugh with, cheer for, and sympathize with each of the characters at various points. And they might just find that choosing sides and sticking with their choice may not be as easy as they&#8217,d initially thought.DON&#8217,T CALL ME BABY is an absolutely delightful read with moments that are bittersweet and others that are incredibly heartwarming. It&#8217,s a story that not only seeks to help mothers and daughters understand one another better, but shows them that sometimes the best way to reconnect is to disconnect.;1
22230;First Line: Waiting was the worst bit: hunkered back against the wall, eyes squinting in the setting sun, waiting for the nod.There's strange goings-on in Aberdeen in this fifth outing by Detective Sergeant Logan McRae. For one thing, it's summer, and the folks in Aberdeen, Scotland don't seem to be familiar with sunshine or warmth. For another thing, the Polish immigrant community is being targeted in a series of gruesome attacks, and McRae actually gets to leave the country to follow up on leads. Most people seem to think these attacks are hate crimes against the Polish, but when a local crime boss is targeted, McRae begins to wonder if something else might be going on.Other than that, the situation seems to be normal: The Detective Chief Inspector seems to have it in for our lad and Detective Inspector Steele continues to go out of her way to make his life miserable. Even though I'd love to slap her briskly about the head and shoulders most of the time, I do like the character of Steele: she serves to remind people that men don't have the politically incorrect slob market cornered.The story moves right along at a good pace, but I'm beginning to notice a change in McRae. Through four books the young man has been unerringly idealistic no matter what is done to him or how many idiotic superiors try to break him. There has been plenty of humor to break the gruesome case load into manageable portions.Not so much in this one. The humor is less, and all the characters seem grimmer. With the lack of humor, the violence of the villains isn't as well disguised and isn't as easy to stomach.How many more infinitely inferior superiors must McRae go through before he leaves the force? Give the poor man a promotion, an entire weekend off, and transfer D.I. Steele!;1
196509;"There are many interesting things about John McCain I was unaware of before I read this excellent book. It's great that McCain has come clean about his many extramarital affairs. That was a tough thing to do!  The chapter ""Why I abandoned Carol and the kids,"" in which McCain outlined his decision to leave his first wife and three small children, is both heartbreaking and inspiring.  I especially liked the chapter in which McCain chronicles the many fistfights he has gotten into while serving in the U.S. Senate. And while I was skeptical at first, I now understand that McCain's plan to tax health benefits,  raise social security taxes and increase FICA 75% will untimately pay for the bailout plan.";1

I adored this book and was blessed to get an ARC thanks to Once Upon A Twilight. She has put up with all my annoying emails about the book and for that: Thank you so much!!Wow. Is all I can say about this book. It was truly amazing. The plot kept you immersed into the story like no other. From the beginning i was absorbed into this book and couldn't put it down. The book might have started off a little slow, but as soon as you got about two chapters in, it had you hooked and you Vanished from the world.Okay, lets start with Jacinda today. Whoa, she is one determined little miss in the latest book. I don't think she stays put or does what she's supposed to for most of the book! She has her heart set on forgetting about  Will but some things you just can't forget. Plus when your sister is the new It girl, things tend to hurt. Plus they call her Jace and well I love the name Jace!!Then there's Cassian, who swoops in and takes everyone back to the Pride. Not willingly though. He promises Jacinda that he will protect her no matter what, and does that from the very beginning. He really saves her butt multiple times, and well also doing some things accidentally along the way, but hey nobodies perfect!I don't think that I could pick a team between Cassian and Will. So maybe I like Cassian a little better because, well who wouldn't love a Draki who's a super hunk? I don't think I could ever love a man who had the blood of my slaughtered brethren running through his veins, even if  it wasn't his fault, but still, not cool dude!!My favorite quotes from the book were:""His mouth curved with a slow smile. 'I've never wanted to be your friend, Jacinda."" Pg 94""Everything else slips away as I stare at him. Where we are. The danger that still threatens..."" Pg 110""From here we crawl."" Page 292""'Lets bring it down.' I mutter. 'All of it.'"" Pg 294I give this book a 59 out of 59. It was an amazing book to read and it will be well worth the wait! Just a couple more days guys!!! Thanks again to Yara from Once Upon a Twilight. Go check out her blog! You won't be disappointed!!~~Sam!";1
593936;Sometimes when I pick up a &#34,Classic&#34, I think it will be boring and unchallenging to the status quo. Not so! This book is very cool. It is about the dust bowl and depresison causeing a mass migration to California. The chapters mostly alternate between giving a big theoretical picture of the causes and then giving the particular demonstration of what is happening using one family. At the time of its publishing it was comdemed for its language and some adult themes which still seem shocking. The author tries to avoid sounding like a communist but that is deffinately the way he is leaning. One of the more radical parts of the book is its insistence that the family unit is dead. Because farms have become huge and the family farms can't compete the new unit needs to be the union not the family. - sounds fairly Marxist to me. The movie of the book follows it super close for the first half but then bails on the books realism, pessimism and theory n the second half. Of course the movie totally deletes the last shocking scene in the book of the mom who has just had a stillbirth nursing an adult male stranger who is starving to death. This is once again Stienbeck saying the family unit is lost we have to do something different. All through the book the mom has been the chief advocate for the family but she totally fails and her family falls apart. In the end she is the one who asks her daughter to nurse the stranger.;1
520505;"I bought this book because it won the Financial Times Book of the Year Award (not a top ten winner or something, #1 mind you). Historically, a reliable guide (e.g., the masterpiece China Shakes the World, and theoretically dubious but highly provocative Friedman's World is Flat). It has dawned on me belatedly that advance praisers probably don't read their books. All these absolutely glowing endorsements by serious people...for a book that *clearly* isn't top notch.T. Bojko's review may seem harsh, but it's spot-on. I can live with the ponderous writing style. I initially thought the big words concealed some new or profound thinking...but not at all.The problems are: 1. there's almost nothing new or inspired about the ""markets of tomorrow,"" and 2. there is nary a sliver of new, actionable advice about investing. The whole thing is a compendium of the superficial. Seeking to cut a swath a mile wide, it is everywhere one inch deep.In regard to the first, the following are superficially summarized: global trade/capital flows (rightly footnoted to Martin Wolf, but Wolf's own columns are better on this), a cocktail of snippets on behavioral finance  - called a ""cocktail"" - just read Shiller straightaway, some stuff on global trade and commodities, see latest Economist, a paraphrase of Taleb's colorful insights (just read Taleb directly), a woefully weak primer-not-really on securitization, a brief primer on asset classes that repeats everything I've got in a dozen other finance books, and too much material on IMF (e.g., not a single mention of Basel). I agree the topics per se are important, but most of them here are superficially derivative of other, better works.Here are the four insights from Chapter 2: we are coming from a period of aberrations, many puzzles, too many dismissed them as noise, the inability to distinguish signal from noise is a bad thing, the adjustment caught people off guard. I'm not kidding. The blinding insight is: take care to distinguish signal from noise! Noise bad, signal good....Strangest of all, in my opinion, is that the author appears to have nothing to add to the field of risk management, which stuns me given his unique vantage point. Risk management is reduced to a few catchphrases: tail risk, moral hazard, principal-agent. Say it ain't so...Finally, T. Bojko is right about the mundane asset allocation plan: ""the author just lays out a pretty mundane asset allocation plan (which is available for free on any number of websites) and then fills a couple dozen pages with worthless blather. Seriously, that's it."" That's exactly right.The book boils down to: big ""structural"" change is coming, try to sort signal from noise, here's pointers to a bunch of good reading material, I worked at the IMF, start with this generic plan.I saved you a few bucks. More to the point, I wasted my time reading this book so you don't have to. Since that time is lost to me forever, the least you can do is vote my review ""helpful.""";1

164983;The book commences with an interesting history of the fast food chain and the American and world love for cheap and convenient food. He slowly pulls away from the commercial side to explain the horrors that lurk beneath.The story is of interest until the point where the author pushes anti-globalisation and anti-modernisation, turning many unrelated situations to his viewpoint. The storytelling was akin to describing the industrial revolution and complaining that people were losing their jobs in the farms, as opposed to the American dream of progress and an improved way of life for all.Of particular mention was the Author's description of the failure of communism in The Soviet Union, the failure was complex, based around the political situation as well as ideological and the implementation of the system. Not, as the author describes it primarily as a result of the countries technological outlook. Bombings mentioned in the book were as a result of religious and political differences and not as the author describes it as an anti-capitalistic revolt.;1
271557;"I thought this was an improvement over her last book.  ""Raw Food Real World"" left me a little cold- of course everything was beautiful, but so much of it seemed expensive and unattainable (between hard-to-find ingredients and hours long dehydration time) that I found it pretty easy to put down.This is much better.  While I know the other included information on basics, this one seems to get to the point more quickly.  Loved the recipes for milks, juices, smoothies and breakfast foods.  She also provides a good bit of information on green smoothies, very popular now in the raw world.  I've been drinking them already, but her descriptions- not even her pictures- made me want to run to my co-op and pick up some greens immediately.She acknowledges that not everyone has the time to make the gorgeous restaurant-quality food her staff can, but then she has a chapter on easy to prepare foods that don't require too much special equipment (mandoline and in some cases a high-speed blender) and can be put together quickly.  Heavy on the salads, but the difference between torn lettuce and julienned peppers and zucchini is vast.  And while you eat avocado with your lettuce now, have you ever thought of putting guacamole in romaine leaves, like stuffed boats?  Really good, really doable.Yes, there were lots of recipes that I don't think I'm ever going to make, but even the more complicated recipes seemed back to basics, such as the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.  (That I might make.)  If nothing else, there was a lot of food for thought regarding new flavor combinations and techniques.  Irish moss never looked so good.Finally, she gave a lot of interesting information on topics such as hemp, rooftop urban gardening (yes!), soy and, I believe, sea vegetables, among other topics.  She also talked about her continuing journey with raw foods and healthy living.A lot of other authors in this field are inspirational.  It almost seems like she went out of her way to instead be relatable.  Good for her.Oh yeah, about the smoker she included in the book: I'm glad that person is at least eating more healthfully.";1

314034;I gave this book four stars because it was hard to put down. I borrowed it from the library because it was showcased in a Borders book store. The reviews seemed glowing. But in the end, I was puzzled.Reading, I got a sense of deja vue. It's one of those apocalyptic novels - a very plausible end-of-the-world scenario where authorities react and overreact to the spread of a mysterious and deadly disease. It's also a story where the heroine Jiselle grows from a spoiled, somewhat self-centered flight attendant to rise to a truly horrific occasion.I can imagine discussions in a book group.  Mark is a mystery but didn't Jiselle smell a few rats? If you've read The Pilot's Wife by Anita Shreve, you may feel you're on familiar ground before you get past the first  third of the novel. I can see why Jiselle might want to marry. But a thirty-something flight attendant would be expected to be savvy about airline pilots. Many flight attendants are actually quite cynical about pilots, read Elliott Hester's book, Plane Insanity.If the book was supposed to be realistic on a mundane level, the author should have done some research about airline personnel. I almost stopped reading after the first few pages, where Jiselle is drinking wine in a bar while wearing her uniform, complete with wings. That's hard to imagine. Flight attendants and pilots are not allowed to drink in uniform. They aren't even supposed to be in a bar in uniform. If her luggage was lost, she might have worn her uniform skirt and blouse with no insignia. She wears cute Italian shoes but are they regulation?Mark didn't have to be gone for so many days after they married. Pilots and flight attendants might fly all over, but they have regular trips. They often are home more than people with regular jobs.  As a senior captain, Mark could bid one-day turnarounds. He certainly didn't have to go to Australia. With three children and a new wife, why was he running around all over the world? Jiselle would know this before she married him.  She would certainly have asked why he was bidding all those distant destinations. And if he did choose long trips, he'd have days off in between. So a key premise of the novel doesn't ring true.Some reviews said it all comes together at the end. I didn't get that feeling. We got hints of what might have happened but not a clear explanation.  For me, the book ended not with a bang, but with a whimper...and a rather whiny, depressing one at that.;1

My copy of this book has over 50 pages tagged indicating where I have discovered a JW Gem. Many of us will not be lucky enough to attend a workshop run by Jack Welch and thus the next best thing is this book and his webcasts, which are accessible via YouTube.While JW says that he doesn't like the word legacy - I believe he has left a profound legacy in Leadership and management. In some respects his work is like a 21st century updated version of Peter Drucker. Many of the traits JW has made famous are consistent with the management mastermind Peter Drucker, abandonment, candor, differentiation, letting go of under performing staff, etc.This book is ideal for CEO's there direct reports and managers who want to be noticed for the right reasons. If we all put a bit of Jack Welch into our management and leadership we would have a much better chance of being successful.In other words: This is a MUST READ from the master.;1

The story was entertaining, but not of the caliber of the previous Snicket books.  While I enjoyed having adults seen as thick and gullible (children can identify with this, for sure) and chuckled at the word play that is a characteristic of Snicket, the story itself wasn't as enjoyable or as captivating as the previous books.  Certainly Snicket has not lost his style, and the book is fun to read.  But in comparison of the Reptile Room and Bad Beginning, I didn't think it was as good.;1

595326;"In Stella Gibbons's contemporary classic novel Cold Comfort Farm (1932), the orphaned, 20-year-old Flora moves in with distant relatives living on a remote farm in Sussex, England.  Accustomed to glamorous London, Flora is not equipped to handle the hardscrabble life of a farmer, but with unflagging enthusiasm, she makes the best of her bleak circumstances.  Flora sets about improving the farm and the lives of its inhabitants, who have suffered under the tyrannical influence of Aunt Ada Doom for many years.Flora's first glimpse of Cold Comfort Farm is anything but cheery:""Dawn crept over the Downs like a sinister white animal, followed by the snarling cries of a wind eating its way between the black boughs of the thorns.  The wind was the furious voice of this sluggish animal light that was baring the dormers and mullions and scullions of Cold Comfort Farm.""As this overwrought passage suggests, Cold Comfort farm is intended as a parody of the sentimental and grim novels of rural life popular during Gibbons's lifetime (see, e.g., Mary Webb's The Golden Arrow).  Despite a limited (or nonexistent?) collective memory of books like Webb's, Gibbons's parody remains fresh and accessible and, most importantly, hilarious.  Overall, Cold Comfort Farm is an entertaining and unique reading experience.";1

570861;"I just love this book! I found it in a Barnes and Nobles, and even though there weren't any reviews on Amazon yet and even though it was pricier than some of its competitors, I bought it anyway. (That's pretty unusual for me.) Every time I open it, I'm grateful to myself all over again. It's just wonderful. Where to start? First, it's absolutely gorgeous, with an inviting color scheme and a pleasing layout that makes it super easy to read through. (Trust me, you don't want to skimp on the readability of your sewing book.) The book itself is both lovely and sturdy -- beautiful glossy pages and a binding that promises to hold up for a long time, yet easily lays flat.But my absolute favorite thing about this book is that all the lessons are presented in photographs, which means it's realistic. The truth of the matter is that when everything is drawn, a lot of the nitty-gritty details are left out. Then when you go to sew something, you get confused because it looks different than it does in the illustration. This book shows the fabric just the way it is -- raveling edges, not-quite-straight stitching, and everything -- which reassures me that I'm not doing it wrong.You visual learners will also love that this book is all pictures with minimal text. Have you ever read through a sewing book where it was mostly text? It's ridiculously confusing, full of technical terms and spatial references like ""the curve on the side adjacent to the side closest to you."" Yuck! Unless you already know how to do it, it's impossible to piece together. Which sort of defeats the point of buying the book. This book does it all in pictures which, I should mention, are superbly photographed. Some books have pictures where the camera is several feet away from the sewing machine and you can't see anything at all. These photographs are taken up close and have comments on the side with neat little arrows showing which part they're talking about. It's an ingenious presentation. I just can't praise it highly enough.Now, my limitations as a reviewer: I've not used this book extensively, nor am I an experienced seamstress, so I couldn't tell you how comprehensive the material is. Nor have I pawed through every other book on the market for comparison. All I know is that this book works great for me, and everything it presents, it does so spectacularly.";1

It presents a dystopian vision of the future centered in Chicago that mirrors all too easily certain attitudes that are prevelant today.  It is an entirely readable and relatable book, although its central motifs are not all that new.Sixteen-year-old Beatrice lives in a world divided into five factions: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless, and Erudite.  These five factions represent the qualities that each faction thinks is most important in the fight against what ills and destroys societies.  Everything is perfect on the surface, but Beatrice quickly learns that appearances are deceiving.  At sixteen, she undergoes an aptitude test that is meant to determine which faction she truly belongs in, yet her results show her to be a ""Divergent"", someone with no true faction.  Then at her Choosing ceremony, Beatrice joins the Dauntless faction, hoping to become fearless like they are.  Taking the new name Tris, she learns how to fight and protect herself, both physically and mentally, while fending off enemies simulated and real.  Through her initiation she learns a lot about herself and much more about human nature and just how dangerous it can be to be a divergent.  When Tris uncovers a plan for revolution, she knows she must take matters into her own hands, even if it means putting herself, those she has come to love, and those she has left behind in danger.""Divergent"" is the first in a planned trilogy by Veronica Roth.  This first installment wraps up with most of the questions answered but with plenty of room left for readers to wonder just how the story will continue and what will happen in Roth's intriguing world.  Certain elements get annoying after a while - Roth's repeated emphasis on how small and vulnerable Tris is, the all-too-familiar plotline of the heroine getting in trouble and being rescued by the boy she likes - but the author makes this haunting world a unique place to visit and one that will leave readers curious for more since it seems as if Roth has just barely scratched the surface.";1
632173;"Wow! What an awesome book. This classic thriller/mystery was such a gripping tale of duplicity. I couldn't put it down once I started reading. It wasn't what I imagined it to be, but after filtering all the 1880's lingo, I was spell bound the minute Mr. Utterson stepped on the scene of Dr. Jekyll's front door. I would highly recommend this to anyone over the age of 13. This short novel didn't waste a single word. It was filled with beautiful prose, realistic dialogue (for it's time) and quite a thrilling plot and twist.The brilliance comes through in such passages as,,, ""First, because I have been made to learn that the doom and burden of our life is bound for ever on man's shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and awful pressure..."" found near the end - near the end of the author's own life. Somehow that makes this book more meaningful and its theme more powerful...5 Stars!Jeff BenningtonKilling the GiantsThe Rumblin: A Short Story";1

91517;If you are looking directly for the answer to the title question, you will need to skip to the conclusion at the end for what is basically a decent narrative.  The author comes to the same conclusions that I have read in more than a dozen articles and editorials.  Which is, with the dominence of church-run states using it's resources to keep down women and dissenters, and the reliance on one industry, the countries of the Middle East have dug themselves into a hole.  Faced with teeming poverty in their countries due to gross-mismanagement, the rulers blame outside influences like the United States and Jews as the cause of their problems, where they have only themselves to blame.The fact that I agree with these statements doesn't make this a great work.  It does clearly explain all of the above in it's conclusion, but it is nothing original.  Faced with trying to get it published as a book, they slapped on a VERY brief history of the Middle East to fill in some pages.  This, too, can be found in many other sources.I liked it as reinforcement of things I pretty much already knew and believed, but there aren't that many readers uninformed enough that this would be a learning experience.  The author should have tried harder.;1
133087;This is a page turner if there ever was one. From start to finish a well written western.

26647;In 1933 and the first half of 1934, a Great Depression frightened public adore the Firefly brothers though Jason and Whit Fireson are violent bank robbers.  The siblings do what many dream of doing but are too afraid when they boldly commit robberies.However, in August 1934, proud law enforcement authorities announce the end of these vicious felons as the bullet ridden corpses of the Firefly brothers lay in an Indiana morgue.  Their girlfriend Darcy Veronica are heartbroken with grief as is their mom and though a straight shooter their brother Weston.  However, the cops prove premature with their bloody announcement as Jason and Whit wake up and calmly leave the morgue to begin the further escapes in legends of The Many Deaths of the Firefly Brothers.Although how the siblings stay alive through their dangerous capers is never explained, fans will not care as the Firefly Brothers adventures are a timely allegorical historical, desperate people have given up on a pathetic government and turned to antiheroes as champions.  Action-packed, this is a terrific parable that uses the war on crime during the Great Depression in comparison with the war on terrorism during the Great Recession.  The stark reality of the Great Depression on the lives of ordinary people is enhanced by the fantastic Firefly brothers who symbolize the frustration with government that fails to act (Henry Higgins Effect of Democrats in charge) or unwilling to act (Pygmalion Effect of Republicans in charge) when the need is obvious, which implies in charge or not Republicans win and people lose so they turn to antiheroes.Harriet Klausner;1
71059;While the title of this book refers to Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Michela Wrong's descriptive writing is reminiscent of  Evelyn Waugh's travel and fiction writings about Africa.  Describing a troubling subject, the reign of Joseph Mobutu and  its dependence upon Western institutions to finance its ruinous and destructive rule of Congo/Zaire, Wrong's tone is facile  and intelligent, devoid of any preaching.  This book's appeal extends beyond those interested in Africa to anyone wanting a  well told tale polished with an exceptional sense of irony about greed and survival in politics. Given the author's skill,  experience and knowledge, this book could probably have been twice as long and I still would have enjoyed it.;1

145315;In the book, Patriot Reign, Holly does a good job of defining the Patriot brand and culture. Belichick molds the team to his beliefs, values and philosophy.I give an A- to the overall evaluation of the book. I would explain later why I did not give it  an A+. Belichick beliefs are simple, there is a link between high productivity and preparation. The preparation part- he is obsessed with it, to the point if you work for him and not prepare, there is no worse sin. And you will not be working for him too long. Alongs with preparation, Belichick studies and studies everything about opponents. He gives tests to his football players and coaches. They must know every angle about their opponents. A meeting with 30 questions about their opponents is common and you must know the answer. Holly uses one example of Belichick that if he was going for an interview and the standard question is, what do you know about our company? He would answer , Everything! That is his philosophy. there is no excuse for lack of preparation and hard work. The book is an insider look at what makes the Patriots tick. Before Belichick, in 2000, the Patriots sucked and he turned the team around winning the Super Bowl in 2001 and 2003 during the time the book was written. I wished he would have written a follow up book after they won two more Super Bowls.Before each game, the players literally were in a school room, they needed to know the game plan, all the possible options regarding their positions and the opponent's positions, they needed to verbally say what can they do to win the game.Belichick's life is also touched upon and why he is the way he is, Holly explains that Belichick was an only child, his father worked as an assistant coach for the U.S. Naval Midshipman Academy. His father valued hard work, high character, preparation and football. These values were instilled in Belichick and he ran his team with these values. His father used to sit down with a young Belichick and go over meticulously the football films.And Belichick went to privileged schools and graduated from Wesleyan who fellow graduates were from President Bush family and other power and movers. Holly touches upon the draft and the combine which were interesting and i have a better understanding of both.Holly does a good job of describing Belichick, his temper( ESPN  Tom Jackson said during a TV show that Patriot's players hate their coach, Belichick was furious and after they won the SuperBowl, Jackson tried to shake Belichick's hand , and Belichick said F**** Y****.  And he is loyal to his coaches and his closest coaches, like Scott Pioli, Romeo Crennen and others.  Holly touches upon the Parcellls and Belichick drama which I found boring, and he touches upon Bill Brady which I wished he would have spend more time with and given us a more insider look at Brady too.Why I did not give it an A+ was because I wanted more insider's information like when he said that Brady has a special selection in his iPod for his championship games, I wanted more:  The players, what little trivia - the public didn't know about a Tedy Bruschi,  Brady or other players. Holly did spend some time on Belichick like visiting his cousin who was dying from cancer. And his visit to his parents.  And they thing I wanted to learn was more about football, Holly did write about some defenses like Cover 1 and Cover 2 and a few other plays that the quarterback made but it was really shallow not in depth in a book like this where he spend two years with the team. I would have expected the different formations and compare them to other teams and more specific about the positions especially the tight ends which Belichick is partial too.I loved this book and I wish there was a follow up-part two.;1
221083;After reading all the glowing reviews about Of Noble Birth, I thought I would enjoy this novel.  I didn't.  It was hard to see the romance between the lead characters.Heroine Alexandra works for her drunken step-father.  She is frightened of him and when she is sure he intends to do her great bodily harm she attempts to run away to her aunt's home in London.  Due to circumstances beyond her control she is abducted and taken aboard a ship.  She is mistaken for the Captain's half sister Anne.Captain Nathaniel Kent has kidnapped his half sister hoping to trade her for a crew member his father is holding hostage.  His father is a sadistic man and he is convinced that his father will make the trade.  Unfortunately he has kidnapped the wrong woman and he does not believe her protestations at first.  He is in fact attracted to his sister, a concept which was not that heroic.When he finally discovers Alexandra's identity it is almost a relief to both of the leads.  This couple is still at loggerheads throughout a large portion of this book.Alexandra and Nathaniel have a terrible tendency to talk past each other and Alexandra has a habit of believing the very worst of Nathaniel.  They bicker often and have little patience for each other.  These two face constant peril from Nathaniel's father the Duke of Greystone.  The Duke is so diabolical he actually wanted Nathaniel murdered at birth because he had an arm that was somewhat deformed.  The action in this novel is kept at a high level with sea battles, daring escapes and smuggling but the connection between the leads was not that strong.  I felt like the leads were constantly wary of each other to the point of being emotionally distant.  The action sequences are well written however, easy to visualize and the villains well described.  For me this was much more a tale of adventure rather than a passionate romance.;1
266908;"This is a pretty good book. The last book that I read that was related to lie detection was ""Telling Lies"" by Paul Ekman. That book has been in print a lot longer than this one but has many fewer reviews (leading me to believe that it has sold many fewer copies and has many fewer readers). What makes this book decent?1. The ease of reading. The whole book can be read through in about 3 hours/ one afternoon. There is lots of white space and it keeps the eyes moving very easily. The ""Telling Lies"" book had SO MUCH waffle and just *dragged on* for such a long time that it felt like it went on for 6 months.2. There are lots of diagrams. A picture is worth 1,000 words, and the author saved a lot of writing by just *showing* us what he was saying instead of saying it.3. The writing was very light and easy, and 234 pages of prose went by like 120 (and so the book can easily be read twice in order to glean the last little bit of information that we missed).4. The total number of photographs was 90. That's plenty of illustrations to demonstrate what was being discussed--and cut down on the number of words used in description.5. The author brings to the table perspective in two ways: First with ACTUAL FIELD WORK as an FBI agent (and this is more practical, real-world experience than most psychologists have) and second as a second language speaker of English (when you go someplace and navigate in a second language, facial expression becomes a primary tool for understanding what people are saying). In fact, his real life experiences were richly detailed in the omnipresent Box Inserts.Navarro goes over the whole body bit from bottom to top, and he starts at the feet/ legs because (in his professional estimation) they are the most honest parts of the body and people don't learn to conceal their emotions in them. His single rationalizing theme was *the limbic system*. So, the rational part of your brain will tell you one thing to do but the automatic part of your brain will force you to behave in another way.Bad parts:1. There were no less than 58 (!) Box Inserts that gave illustrative stories, and that got annoying after a while (constantly having reading interrupted with these stories and then having to go back into the text to find out where you were again), but they were not so long that you couldn't read them and then not get right back to where you were before.2. Some of the things.....I just couldn't see where he was coming from (and that is fine, because there were so many assertions made that it would have been just too much to find a reference for *every single assertion*).Verdict: This book is worth the Kindle price as of this review ($9.99) and definitely worth a secondhand purchase. Worth the time, worth the money.";1

557864;Though I am not a female, I am intrigued by the strong feminism evident in this book, so I do recommend this book. Margaret Eleanor Atwood warns her audience of the insidious, lurking sexism and male superiority that can arise at any instant in contemporary society. Because the book is a feminist protest, it argues that women are being dominated by men through a subtle and unnoticeable tendency, and Atwood's purpose is to reveal that very innate unconsciousness of human nature that is imperceptible to society.Though she is from a feminist point of view, Atwood directs her book's content towards all types of audiences - male and female, antifeminists and feminists, through its subtle satire and dramatizing of an improbable futuristic society. Because this book is a dystopian fiction, it is all just a speculation, futuristic and unnecessarily realistic. However, the whole point of the novel is to argue the fact that the natural tendency of government is to have a society run by male domination. Though the citizens might not perceive of this insidious trend, Atwood argues that it will inevitably happen if society does not notice and stop it before it is too late. Much of this ultimate male domination is due to the fact that the repercussions of male power are devastating. As men begin to gain more power, they are eager to exercise their newfound authority, and thus they unknowingly crave for more power at the expense women equality. Supporting an egalitarian society, Margaret Atwood stresses the importance of realizing the natural inclination for human society to drift into a male dominated government, and the only way to prevent this ultimate devastation is to start today and protect women rights and equality.This book does not so much include allusions, but it is in itself a whole allusion that parallels the theme of a previously written book. Both taking place in the near future, Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 are dystopian novels that reveal the terrifying plausibility that constitutional freedom can be readily taken away, thus both authors stress the need to preserve that valuable right. Also, it somewhat resembles Orwell's 1984, as it also concocts a theoretical dystopian world.Margaret Atwood's Handmaid's Tale should be read slowly, because it requires a prodigious amount of attention to detail as it is written as a satire. Because satire is increasingly subtle in higher works of literature, this novel deserves a very close read between the lines. Much of the light humor is attributed to the style and, in this instance, the tone dominates the humor. At first glance, the novel may seem centered on serious matters of a male dominated society, but a closer read would unravel a whole new point of view under a different light - one that is light and sarcastic. Therefore, it is imperative that The Handmaid's Tale be read under a close magnification, because of Atwood's use of a satirical toneThis book is thought provoking, because it makes me reflect on today's government and the way our society is organized. I wonder if our constitutional rights are truly secured or are we all just conditioned to believe that our rights are secured?;1

570146;"I've read Gustav Hasford's ""The Shorttimers,"" and Tim O'Brien's ""The Things They Carried."" Both are excellent books and I heartily recommend them, but neither I think can compare to James Webb's classic ""Fields of Fire.""Webb's book is from the James Jones school of realism. The book has the stinging ring of authenticity and no wonder, Webb was a Marine officer in Vietnam himself and won the Navy Cross, a Silver Star and two Bronze Stars so he definitely knows of what he writes.But this isn't just a book written by an officer about officers. His portraits of the enlisted men are just as real and are full blooded characters. Some are tough, mean and unlikeable, but hey, that's real life for you.And just like real life, you'll find yourself bonding and getting close to these characters and when some are killed, you are affected.Be warned: ""Fields of Fire"" isn't a happy story. The ending is tragic but given the setting of the story, it's entirely appropriate.Mr. Webb has done himself and the Marines who served in Vietnam a great honor.Semper Fi Mr. Webb.";1
619269;In this rightly famous essay, J.S. Mill explains his vision on the `Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen' adopted by the National Constituent Assembly in Paris in August 1789 on a proposition by the marquis de La Fayette.The individual (liberty, sovereignty, responsibility)The individual is sovereign over his body and mind. His liberty concerns thought, opinion, sentiment, taste, pursuit and combination (freedom to unite and to trade).The limit to his liberty is based on one very simple principle: the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others.He has also responsibilities: it is a moral crime to bring a child into existence without a fair prospect of being able, not only to provide food for its body, but instruction and training for its mind.SocietySociety has jurisdiction over any part of a person`s conduct which affects prejudicially the interests of others. Also, everyone who receives protection of society owns a return for the benefit (e.g., bearing one's share in defending one's country).But, the (majority of) people or the government has no right whatsoever to control the expression of opinion (media). Any doctrine, however immoral, has the fullest liberty to be professed or discussed.A culture without freedom never makes a liberal mind. A genius can only breed in an atmosphere of freedom.Philosophy (utilitarianism), religionJ. S. Mill regards utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions, but utility in the largest sense, grounded on permanent interest of man as a progressive being.For J. S. Mill, religion has no utility: `the notion that it is one's duty that another should be religious was the foundation of all the religious persecutions ever perpetrated.'For Calvinism, human nature is corrupt and should be killed in all human beings.The Catholic Church is a monument of censorship.Criticism (free trade)J.S. Mill is a staunch defender of free trade. For reasons of efficacy, producers, sellers and buyers should be completely left free. Restrictions on trade (also of opium) are indeed restraints, and all restraint is an evil.We saw, lately, the havoc tree trade could inflict on the world economy. Without governmental intervention, the whole free trade system would have collapsed.J.S. Mill's brilliant defense of the liberty of the individual is a must read for all liberals and democrats.;1
300721;An axcellent book all about a 15 year old girl who gets abducted but somehow survives a serial killer.  It's more to do with the mysterious relationship between the two.  This has been described as the 'stockholm syndrome' where captives somehow grow an alliance with their captors.  It's well written and a good deep insight into a now grown lady who has to cope with married life and growing children including a daughter around the same age as she was when she was abducted, as well as this mongrel about to be executed, who contacts her and their relationship is such that she is driven to also speak to him again.  I won't nit pick as one could find some faults, but it's not worth it in the end of the day.  It's basically a well written good book and i would recommend it.;1
347691;This is n engrossing book, combining personal history with Russian history with an interesting mystery.I won&#8217,t go into what the book is about as it&#8217,s already been well noted by other reviewers.The Russian history and how difficult a time it was as well as really getting into the thoughts of the characters are this book&#8217,s strengths. Likewise, it&#8217,s interesting to see how the auction houses work and how things are catalogued. Each chapter begins with a description of the jewels being auctioned and the descriptions lead into the chapters and align nicely.There is a parallel to the 2 main female characters, Nina and Drew, both are closed off, stuck in their past and haunted by memories and neither women are warm nor endearing. Although, I felt that Nina becomes so and her character evolves more throughout the book. I did not find Drew&#8217,s story nearly as interesting or was there enough about her that made me want to know more about her.  So here is where the book fell short for me and was the difference between a good book and a great one. The male characters, I felt, were much more interesting and colorful.I would have appreciated more details of the history of Russia at that time and would have loved to learn more about Nina&#8217,s journey from Russia to the US. Perhaps making Drew a bit more interesting would have made this book a bit more satisfying.;1
468532;"I honestly didn't know how I was going to react to this mainly because I have never finished a Neil Gaiman book (I know, blasphemy!). But, I have to say that I really enjoyed reading this.First, for an adult fantasy book, the protagonist is a child and Neil Gaiman does a wonderful job of portraying the story from a child's point of view. There are some moments in the book (I don't want to write spoilers) where the content is really ""adult"" and we, as readers, are able to pick up on it based on the innocent observation of our main character. I think that alone speaks for Neil's writing abilities.As for the book itself, it is really short and it's really engrossing. I started reading it out of guilt (since I have a stack of books that I've been neglecting due to studying and other obligations) and I couldn't put it down until I was done reading. It is extremely well-written and it's very easy to get lost in his words and the story that he tells. The best part is that, even though this book is fantasy, it doesn't shove the fantasy elements into your face (does that make sense!?) which I love since fantasy is one of the harder genres to get into since you have to familiarize yourself with the world first.The ending was very bittersweet. Our protagonist returns to his homeland and all the events that are related to his adventure is given ""adult"" explanations that make perfect sense. He goes to see Lettie (I am holding back tears and resisting the urge to rant) and, while reading, I swear I was about to cry and not for a good reason. Personally, I thought that Neil Gaiman picked a perfect ending. Granted it's not your typical happily-ever-after but I thought that it suited the story very well.I had to chop off half a star though mainly because I thought the way the climax was handled was way too convenient. I personally hated the antagonist and thought that she was a perfect villain and the way that she was ultimately defeated and how the story ended disappointed me.Overall, a great book to read and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read it. Best of all, it's in a small, digestible chunk so you can be sure that you won't have to wait long to finish it.Review originally posted at [...]";1

But, when I realized that it was a satire on Victorian social mores and the class system of the time, I thought it was a clever and humorous way to expose snobbery, callousness, and pretension. The mystery element keeps one guessing as well. I am looking forward to the fourth book in the series.;1

326255;It's been over a decade since the last Kenzie/Gennaro book, and in one of the nicest touches to Moonlight Mile, Lehane's newest (and presumably final) book in the series, the characters have aged over that time as well, and their lives are in a very different place than when we last left them. Finding out the ways in which their lives have changed is one of the pleasures of this book, so I'll leave most of them out, what matters is that Kenzie and Gennaro's lives have calmed down, largely by choice, since the violence of the earlier books. Calmed down, that is, until Beatrice McCready, the aunt fromGone, Baby, Gone, comes with some distressing news. Moonlight Mile is in many ways a followup to the events of Gone, Baby, Gone, and as in his best work, Lehane is capable of mixing the sins of the past with the crimes of the present, and his ability to trade on our history with these characters gives the book a strong emotional heft. That being said, Moonlight Mile is better for fans than as a standalone, it feels slimmer and less developed, and plot seems more perfunctory here, an excuse to hang out with these characters one more time. As a fan of the series, I can't complain about that at all. While Moonlight is probably the weakest of the series from a plot perspective, as a coda to the books, it works wonderfully, and the decision to come back to the characters of Gone is a smart one, considering the open-ended emotional damage left by that book. The book lacks the great writing and gradual pacing of Lehane's best works, but that's more than made up for by catching up with these characters and seeing how their lives have changed. It's essential for fans of the series, whatever its faults as a book, it's a joy to return to these characters one more time.;1
476980;The premise of this book sounded interesting, but I'll admit that I wasn't expecting to get really into this book.  Boy was I wrong.From the start, we're shown what a lonely life Libby leads, and I just wanted to hug the poor girl.  But when she meets Peter, one of three brothers in a hit boy band, she gets her first taste at what it's like to feel alive again.  From their initial meeting there is a strong connection between them that neither can understand.  Peter finds himself doing something he never thought he would, ditching his band obligations, just to squeeze in time to see Libby.  I loved the connection between Libby and Peter, it brought me right back to the first time you fall in love.  The author did a fantastic job of pulling you back to those emotions, how strong and yet simple they are.Aside from the difficulty with Peter's hectic schedule, there stands another obstacle between their being together, Libby's lunatic aunt.  I really, really, hated this woman.  Not because she was a poorly created character, but because she was a wonderfully created, evil woman.  This woman keeps Libby cooped up in the dilapidated farm house, hurling insults at the poor girl for her own amusement.  I hoped this woman had a terrible fate, she surely deserved it.  But being with Peter helps Libby come alive again and find her strength, and she's finally ready to stand up for herself.  Then someone else tries to tear Libby and Peter apart.  And he does.  Libby's life spirals out of her control.I have to say, I really felt for Libby.  Just when her world finally has a spark of life in it, with a blink, it's gone, and she's faced with one horrible situation after another.  I got so wrapped up in the story, I was fully prepared to be mad at the author if Libby never got a break.  I was very (pleasantly) surprised by the suspense in the last half of the book.  Just as you thought Libby and Peter would find each other again, bang, they didn't.  I had full intentions of reading this book over a few days, when I could squeeze it in, but I ended up so hooked I stayed up late and finished it in one night.The author had a wonderful mix of description, setting, and dialogue.  She pulled the elements together flawlessly, like a true pro at the craft.  Anyone can learn to write, it can be grammatically correct, follow all the `rules' of writing - but it takes a writer's heart to make a book feel real.  This author, no doubt, has a writer's heart, and the talent to match.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is a YA or romance fan.*I received a free copy for review;1
103757;I went ahead a bought this book even though the reviews were not that good because I had read all of the other books in the series already and I was committed to it. I expected a flop and I got a book that really stuck with me for a while. I think there were a lot of reviews that were just too harsh. I had met Valentine and Nell in the previous books and looked forward to their story. I was not disappointed. I thought the story was perfectly told and I was sorry when I reached the end. I recommend the series.;1
144573;"Some novels are merely entertaining, others teach you about other places and other times, and some very special ones teach you deeply about yourself.  Jennifer Haigh's ""The Condition"" is one of those.  I've encountered novels of penetrating vision into the life and deepest psychological mindset of a character a handful of times - and they have been transformative moments in my life (like the time when, deeply depressed, I found myself recognizing Anna Karenina's suicidal anguish with an almost physical shock.  Like encounter therapy, Tolstoy's deep insight into human suffering taught me that I was not alone in my anguish and that knowledge may have saved my life.)  I had several such encounters with vital human wisdom in ways that have moved and transformed me in reading ""The Condition"".  If I could give this novel six stars I certainly would.It's almost impossible to discuss the plotting of this novel without spoilers because some of the character's primary issues are discovered as startling revelations.  I don't want to spoil those revelations so I'm going to use a broad brush.  Suffice it to say that this is a book about a family that falls apart.  The fact that a daughter has a medical condition is but one of an array of everyday challenges.  It's a mistake to think that this is a medical drama in any way.  The ""condition"" of Gwen is hardly the most debilitating affliction going on here.  The father, Frank is career obsessed and often absent, the mother, Paulette, is prudish, controlling, and insecure, the two sons Billy and Scott each have significant challenges (no spoilers - you need to discover them as part of the narrative), and Gwen has Turners.  Like a lot of families they aren't very good at communicating and they grow apart and deal with their issues without a lot of mutual support.  The way these challenges manifest themselves in the lives of the characters - their romantic connections and careers - is where the wisdom by example lies.  I kept seeing aspects of my choices in their choices.""The Condition"" initially is structured with several long sections that each feel like freestanding brilliant short stories - separate but related because the characters are all in the same family.  Each section centers on a character and consists mainly of character exposition, rather than narrative movement.  Haigh writes in a guileless, almost artifice free way - but her content is utterly astounding in the way she perfectly captures the interior and exterior world of these normal, middle class American white people.  She delves deeply into each character, and her ability to lead us to inhabit each very different life is so brilliant that I actually resented it when, towards the middle of the book, the narrative flow began to take over from character exposition as the the primary thrust of the novel.  We get to see how their choices and issues lead them into troubles of various sorts - and they don't avail themselves of help from their family.  Their emotional distance and growth away from one another will be familiar to many.  Rapidly, these narrative complications become complexly interlocking in a mesmerizing way.  The way the details of the plot unfold and the different narrative lines align and move towards each other relentlessly is extraordinarily crafted.  The sense of verisimilitude never wavers.  It always feels utterly real even as the complications pile up. Each chapter has its own structure and emotionally gut sucking ending too, but together they build and build.In the last few dozen pages towards the end the revelations and growth that transform each and every character take on an aching emotional quality that qualifies this as a tear jerker.  But while other great tear jerkers like ""Terms of Endearment"" are about death and grief, this one is about life and love.  You don't cry because of loss - but because of what is gained.  These characters that you've come to know and care about and whose mistakes you've witnessed and whose bad choices you've suffered through finally come to a place of some honesty and love and it's deeply gratifying.  If you know some broken people, some dysfunctional families or some people who run from pain in their lives this book has something to teach you.  Highest recommendation.p.s. Reading over the previous reviews I can see that many people are annoyed by the mother, Paulette.  She is, certainly, the least sympathetic character in the book and I wonder if part of the reason why I loved this so much is that I related to the sons or the husband and not the mother.  As a man - this books depiction of various problematic marriages was instructive because it allowed me to see the woman's side of those scenes so clearly.  If I were an older mother I might identify with Paulette instead - and I could see how that might be insulting.  I wouldn't dock too many points from this book for this reason.  While this book might feel like a mirror, at times - it isn't.  Some others seem to feel that there are too many broken characters in one family to be realistic.  I guess they are just lucky.  Some question and others praise the depiction of Turner's syndrome.  I guess that's important to some people who want Gwen to be a flag bearer for a real condition.  I just viewed Gwen's condition as another one of those life challenges to be dealt with - and didn't worry about how accurately the syndrome was being represented (and couldn't say as I don't know).  I just went with it and LOVED this book.";1
567723;This a great basic book on finance. I have learned many things that the book talks about through experience and by talking to friends but I recommend it for anyone who wants to understand the basics and create a good financial plan for their life. Too often we ignore the wisdom of understanding each finance instrument and of using the right mix to save for the future.This book will be especially helpful for people who come here to work from another country and must quickly understand the new world of 401(K)s and other investment tools peculiar to the US. I had read Suze Orman's books too and while they give similar advice of living within your means I found Liz Pulliam's book more informative about the actual financial tools.;1

But it was a lighthearted story with likeable characters and a storyline that kept me interested. I actually think this is my favorite of all the Mary Kay Andrews books I've read. Some of her stories can be a bit farfetched, but this one was down to earth and quite enjoyable. I thought it was miles better than Deep Dish or some of her later books.;1

607962;"The 60's paranoia doesn't get more sharp, more funny and more smart than Kurt Vonnegut's ""Cat's Cradle"". But, unfortunately, this portray is still somehow up to date than ever. Published early in that decade, this novel concerns on the fear of a chemical war and the end of the world. One of the characters is a scientist who fathered the Atomic Bomb and also developed something called `ice-nice' that is able to freeze all the water in the world. When the novel was published the world was living the edge of Cold War - hence the interesting metaphor. This is also a cautionary (and very funny) tale about too much power and too much desire of ending the workd. Vonnegut's tone transits between the regular science- fiction and black humor that add more layers to the book. If for one side the characters are plain, on the other, what remains, the fear of a nuclear war or something like it, is very relevant and contemporary.";1
440071;Frank's work never disappoints. Always a wonderful reading experience & this book lives up to her standard. I enjoyed every minute of it, wondering till the very end how it would play out.

93114;I was doing family history research and had relatives who lived in South Dakota during the 1870s and 1880s. Some stayed, many moved. This book details the life changing blizzards of the time, and gives graphic and specific info about the Children's BLizzard, so called because of the deaths of children who were caught by surprise going to or from school when the weather struck. Fascinating read. For me, it painted a clear picture of what my relations would have survived, and why so many left for greener, warmer pastures.;1
367723;So I read this book in probably 3 days. It really sucks you in and you wanna keep reading but I couldn't help myself but yell at the book mentally at times!!! I get annoyed with books that rush into romance too fast... for me there needs to be a time frame of the relationship or a background to why their love happened so fast. That was the only part of the book that made me angry, aside from the embarrassing statements or actions done by the characters. If you overlook this love bit and try and pretend that these characters have known each other for forever, you will see that the story is pretty neat. It's outside the US (Paris) and is not a werewolf or vampire story that you're constantly seeing. It's not hardcore zombie or fallen angels either. It's a nice story about what 'Revenants' are and I'm not gonna explain who and what they are, you'll have to read it. But it was nice reading about a different species for once and meeting them and their rivals. All and all I look forward to read her other stories about the 'Revenants'.;1

250184;Dangerous Heart by Tracy Bateman 4&#9733,(Westward Hearts: Book 3)Historical Romance and Christian Romance that had an actual nice plot. A Hallmark kind of book.  I don't often read either historical romance or Christian fiction books.  Dangerous Heart had a nice medium and some likeable characters.  Tracy Bateman is a new-to-me author and I did jump the gun in reading the last book of this trilogy. I jumped because the heroine, Ginger, seemed more likeable for me.  And she is.  She's a strong woman who has grown up with her outlaw father and his gang.  She doesn't swoon or blush profusely like other historical romance heroines I'm used to.  She isn't a doormat either.And the plot felt realistic.  About prairie life on a westward-bound wagon train heading to Oregon. Along the way they encounter Ginger's dad and his gang.  And then they have to worry about cholera and other dangers (like catching pneumonia if you want to take a bath in the open rivers or giving birth - especially with a doctor who is even praying to God for help because he doesn't know what to do).And then there's drama with Ginger seeking revenge for her brother's death, and her dad and his gang's plans of robbing and such.  It was a little predictable but it never bored me.  I'm actually looking forward to reading the other two books now.;1
521189;"Magee's book has some useful material, but readers have to search for it - the book lacks structure or any sort of focus on actionable material. It begins with Immelt's college and early career at GE - including early major challenges such as handling a faulty compressor design for refrigerators at GE's Louisville facility. (How Immelt handled this could be useful material, but Magee provides no detail.)Welch wanted to get big fast, so he initiated the strategy of GE growing through acquisitions. Immelt has focused more on product development and set the tone via expanded and refurbished R&D, facilities and requiring three idea proposals each year able to generate $100 million in revenue growth. (Organization level involved is not made clear.) GE has a $6 billion R&D, budget, with 60% coming from GE businesses (they get to decide how the dollars are used), 27% from GE corporate, and 13% from outside partnerships. GE emphasizes cross-business benefits from R&D, - eg. use of jet engine blade developments used in wind turbine blades.Sometimes Immelt accepts a majority rule for advice from leading managers, but typically only when he doesn't have strong feelings one way or the other. Immelt says he does this about five times/year - if more, they'd leave, if less, there would be anarchy.Immelt has strongly committed GE to ecomagination - $25 billion in revenues by 2010, R&D, at that point of $1.5 billion.Immelt Thinking: There's no second chance on integrity at GE, its important to like people and want the best for them, leaders should be clear thinkers who can simplify strategy into specific actions, develop expertise in an area and use it as a source of confidence to drive change. Units are partly evaluated by Reicheld's (Harvard) net-promoter score - the number of firms that would recommend GE less those that would not. GE asks industries, ""If you had $200-400 million to spend on R&D, at GE, how would you prioritize it?"" Immelt encourages GE managers to learn from outside the company - go out on visits, ask them how they do things.GE's Leadership Center has 16 levels of courses, including three for executives. The fist is a manager development course focused on basics of a good business. Attendees compete against each other solving simulated problems on a computer, 80 students, 8X/year. After about four years, those progressing attend the second level working on real problems facing GE or the world that GE might solve. Findings are presented to Immelt, who hand-selected the problem. The third level focuses on company culture and is intended for the top 300.";1

520794;I highly recommend this book if you are having issues with milk supply, wondering why your body isn't cooperating or need a voice to tell you that you are not a failure if you are having problems with breastfeeding.  There is a lot of info in this book that you will not learn at the hospital, and may not even learn from a lactation consultant.  It will help you get to the root of a real reason you may be having issues with your supply and offers possible solutions.  Most women have no problems with nursing, but some do, and this book is sensitive to the issue without being preachy and has practical advice.  I wish I had this book with my son 10 years ago, it would have made me feel much better about my awful supply since no one seemed to be able to help me mentally or physically with my supply issues.  This time around with my daughter, who is 4 months old, is so much better in large part to the information provided in this book.  Pair this book with seeing a lactation consultant and I bet your breastfeeding experience will be a successful one!;1
518700;"This is the best book I've found at describing the actual feelings of bipolar. I appreciated its discussion of bipolar between the mania and the depression, and its emphasis on short-term memory and processing problems which make bipolar so difficult. It's good on recognizing bp episode onsets--which so many books are not.The tone is both sympathetic and matter-of-fact, though it can verge into patronizing.The thing I found annoying about the book was that in a fairly short book, something like a hundred pages are given over to Not-Text. All of its many worksheets are presented in the format of, first, an example of a ""patient's"" input on a chart (usually one line---so why print that whole chart?) followed by a blank chart for you to use. Okay. But then all of the blank charts are printed again at the end of the book. Why? They are no more photocopy-ready as the first time they were printed. And these, and the bibliography, and the index are included in the page count.I also found the half-page beginning of each chapter, describing what the chapter will then describe (and they're fairly short chapters) to be a waste of space, at best. It would be nice if other helpful books were listed at the end (which it seemed to promise there would be). And more than two website addresses given.Still, as I said, it's a book well worth its existence. Very readable, comprehensive, and up-to-date.";1

Probably a more mature reader would do better. The story did ramble but I believe that was to be one of its assets. I certainly enjoyed the part in Mexico and drug use before the sixties (had never considered that). Kerouac doesn't seem to have any goals or purpose, but again I believe that is the point he may be trying to make.;1
583190;John Keegan has turned his formidable talent to analysing some of the most famous naval battles of the last 200 years.  For each, he gives an insightful look into the recent history of the times, emphasising technological aspects of ship handling and weapons.  He then breaks down the battles into easy-to-comprehend chunks, followed by an analysis of the consequences (usually political) and the more immediate cost in terms of the sailors and ships involved.While all 4 battles are famous examples of their type, Keegan seems to waffle between choosing battles that were decisive and those that were stalemates.  Trafalgar was a decisive battle, but it was unusual in the Age of Sail that one navy enjoyed such a complete victory over its enemy.  Alternatively, Jutland was a large battle, but the battle itself was a tactical draw in that both sides left the battle with their proportionate strengths intact.  A far more decisive ironclad battle occurred at Tsushima Bay, so why didn't Keegan choose that (admitedly less famous) battle instead?The remaining two battles are from WWII - Midway and the Battle of the Atlantic.  Midway was a clear U.S. victory, and the purest example of carrier-based naval conflict.  The Battle of the Atlantic was ultimately decisive as well, but due to the seesaw of technological advancess, the outcome was very much in doubt for 4 years.  Although the submarines lost the Battle of the Atlantic, Keegan concludes submarines are the ultimate naval weapon available today, and points to the success of the U.S. submarine offensive against Japan.  If that is his conclusion, why not give an account of the Japan-U.S. conflict instead of the Battle of the Atlantic?This is nitpicking, however.  The strength of the book is the masterful analysis of each individual battle.  While I question the overall theme and choice of battles, each chapter in and of itself is fantastic.  Therefore, it gets 4 stars, as it is inferior to Keegan's Face of Battle and Mask of Command in maintaining an overarching theme.;1
286914;This is a great book as far as it goes.  Since I live on the east coast I felt a little snubbed, but there are an awful lot of garden books (Martha Stewart's included) written expressly for us. So this is a good look at the issues on that other seashore.  However!  He had about five pages on present day back yards.  Instead of bashing Martha Stewart for most of that chapter he should have discussed theme gardens, especially fantasy gardens based on Shakespeare or Alice in Wonderland or Winnie the Pooh or Lord of the Rings.  But he was accurate in the section on the edible landscaping, the books sound great, but it's not easy to get plants to actually produce in one's yard.  Sure, plant a two-foot-tall heartnut tree, you may have nuts by the year 2050!  So I recommend this, but he left out a whole category of baby boomer fantasy hobby gardens.;1
118047;Listening for lions is a good book, but nothing about it is screams extraordinary.  I found the story to be interesting in a way, but also quite predictable.  After about the first 50 pages I could more or less guess what was going to happen in the rest of the book.  The part I liked about this book is the telling of a different culture and life style in place unlike were I live.This book in my opinion is one of those books that I can pick up, and not feel the need to finish it.  If it was not on my school book list I probably would not have finished reading this book if I started it.This is a good book though, and if you are in the mood for an easy read I suggest this, but Listening For Lions is not the type of book i feel everyone needs to read.;1

449196;I am super in love with the concept of this cook book.  Sometimes I get paralyzed by indecision when it comes to cooking dinner.  Before you know it, dinner time has come and gone because I couldn't think of what to make and junk food prevailed. I love that this plans everything out for me, including sides dishes. This is huge!It's also perfect that it is organized by season so I can use what's fresh at the farmers market instead of going to the grocery store all the time.  This cook book makes cooking dinner 5 nights a week very do-able.The reason I took off one star is because the first recipe I made from the book was kind of iffy. It was the first recipe listed, the Parmesan Chicken Nuggets.  In the picture the nuggets are a beautiful golden brown.  Mine stayed white-ish and didn't look nearly as appetizing.  I had to cook them way longer than the 15 minutes the recipe instructed.  The carrots were still super crunchy after 15 minutes.  So, if I were to make the recipe again, I would probably pan-fry the chicken nuggets so they got brown and crispy on the outside. Then I would partially steam the carrots so they wouldn't take so long to roast.  But by that point the recipe is not nearly as quick or simple as the cookbook suggests.I am hoping all the recipes aren't like this-- but I'm looking forward to giving them all a try.  They do look great and I'm sure they'll all be satisfying for dinner, even if not perfect.;1

155875;"I have read this book 3 years ago and I am still pursuing greatness for my agency. I think Jim Collins did the opposite of many conventional writers. Generally business thinkers and writers have an opinion and they try to find the appropriate examples and shift them into their philosophy, using these examples to justify their point of view. Jim Collins did the opposite, he first investigated and collected a massive amount of data, then came up with theories and a conclusion. I personally believe, that many business examples today are over-used and many of the theories are not fresh anymore. I am sick and tired of Coca Cola, Apple or Starbucks examples. Therefore, I think Jim Collin's effort is worth an applause. It is a great book that drives from real information. Many of the examples are fresh.As I told before, I am still in pursue of greatness for my company. It was a great inspirational book that made me think of techniques to apply these principles to real life. I would recommend this book to all top level business leaders who aspires greatness for their organisations.One last thing, ""Good enough is Not Enough""!";1
642714;"As a member of the Amazon Vine Program I have read and reviewed between 30-40 books. Many of these books have been quite good while only a few have been stinkers. ""The Help"" is by far the best book that have I read through the Vine program. It really is in a class by itself.""The Help"" is not for everyone - only about 98% of us will really enjoy it. A couple of the negative reviews mentioned poor character development - which I find very hard to believe. Very few modern books have been able to paint as complete of a picture as Ms. Stockett did in introducing us to Minnie, Aibileen, and Minny. The character and the quarks shine through of each of the three main leading ladies. The story is poignant and is nicely paced - although it is 450 pages it reads a little shorter. In some ways this is unfortunate, because most of us do not want ""The Help"" to end.I will not attempt to rehash the plot - many other reviewers have effectively described the story. It is good and mostly believable. I lived in Mississippi for 7 years (northern Mississippi - not near Jackson) I can say that I was truly impressed with Ms. Stockett's ability to capture the black voice. Very impressive- especially for a first novel.Overall - I would compare ""The Help"" to a much less girly version of ""Steel Magnolias"". Not a great comparison I admit. ""The Help"" is centered on social issues and uses dialogue for much of its humor. Some may find the dialogue difficult to follow or even a bit annoying - but my guess is that they will be few and far between. In fact, this is one book where you can trust the overall flood of good reviews.5 stars - One of the top 3 books  written in the last 10 years (that I have read). Buy with confidence.";1

492016;At his best Greg Iles is an author I enjoy.  He incorporates Southern Gothic elements into the mystery format.  His best novels convey a sense of time and place.  Natchez Burning felt  very &#34,by the numbers&#34,.  It was also overlong and repetitive.  I enjoy a good long yarn, but only when the length is adding depth.  While Iles is capable of good character development, most the the characters in this novel are cardboard cutouts.  The more interesting characters are those who appear only in the historical backstory.  This is the first volume of a trilogy, so the overlong story is going to go on and on.;1
576786;I don't know how I missed this for so many years.  My parents even had a copy floating around when I was little but I ignored it like all the other books they had sitting around from when they went to college.I really did enjoy this one.  The tone was fantastic and the first person viewpoint is hard to pull off for most writers.  The dismissive attitude of the protagonist could have easily been overdone but it was just the perfect amount.  In chapter 14 when I just started to notice it Holden has his meltdown and everything starts to come together.So yes I am glad I read this book and look forward to more, it was nice to sit in Starbucks on Sunday afternoon and have a nice Venti Drip and listen to my iPod.  The tables turned over 3 times during the hour I was there so I'm hopeful that the economic end of society isn't here yet.;1

This are the same five star Ann Coulter clones. Amazon erased Coulters negative ratings to bolster Colters book, I wonder if they will do the same thing to the one star reviews in this case. I don't give a damn what McGreevey did to New Jersey (do people really care about New Jersey?). What I am interested in is the complexity of thoughts and behaviors that made MrGreevey a desperate man, and his need for power and image at all cost. On that the book is bold and forthright, and a candid exploration in fighting the inevitability of coming to terms with one's sexuality. For that, I give it five stars and you poor abandoned, ticked off ""Joisey boys"" might find something else to fixate on. Perhaps Loofa king Bill O'Reilly has a new book coming out.";1
550065;&#34,Made to Stick&#34, is a useful book which explores how to make ideas more 'sticky' -- easier to accept and remember for people. The authors provide boatloads of examples of different messages and explain why some of these work and why some of these don't work and also give examples how you could change the message format (to say the same thing!) which would make it easier for people to remember.The book is well structured according to the author's message template for making sticky messages. The SUCCES acronym is this template used throughout the rest of the book. The next six chapters contain one of the elements of the message template. After that is an epilogue which summaries the book and makes some closing remarks. The last part contains a small article which was added after the first release of Made to Stick.The six chapters are for each of the elements of the SUCCES acronym: 1) Simple -- the point of the message needs to be simple and not buried deeply inside the message. 2) Unexpected -- When something unexpected happens in the message, a sudden change or so, then it will be easier to remember the message. 3) Concrete -- ideas ought to concrete with examples as most people are concrete thinkers and won't remember abstract ideas. 4) Credible -- the source of the idea and additional details can give an idea more credibility and making it easier to remember and accept. 5) Emotional -- trying to get an emotional reaction out of people based on a message makes it easier for people to remember. We want to be rational but we are emotional. 6) Stories -- Often good ideas and messages come in stories (with lots of concreteness and color). Formulating messages in stories will increase it's stickiness.Each of the above chapters contains dozens of stories, examples of good and bad messages, and tips on how to improve them. Also each chapter contains a clinic in which they take a message and, using the theme of the chapter, they give two different variants of the same message and explain why one is better than the other.All in all, I enjoyed reading Made to Stick. It was well written and I'll remember a lot of stories from the book as they were pretty... sticky. That said, while reading the book, there was no major Aha! moment, but instead if seemed to add words and concepts to things that I had already experienced. That also made it easy to accept what was written in Made to Stick. The book didn't dramatically change the way I create messages/ideas, but it did gave me a new thinking tool to use. I was going between 3 stars (does what it should do) and 4 stars (good and recommended). I decided to stick with 4 stars. Pretty good, especially for people who give training, are in marketing or in other ways need to make easy to remember -- sticky -- messages.;1
286767;There were tiny nuggets to be sifted out of the self-absorbed dreck but they didn't contain enough value to put up with the smug, self-congratulatory text.The book exists less a meditation about pursuing satisfaction and joy in living day to day and much more as an excuse to run through the author's laundry list of just how swell it is to live her little bubble-world life. Wonderful job? Check. Loving marriage? Check. Precious kids? Fascinating friends and dinner parties? Nice home? Health? Success? Check. Check. Check. But even with all of this, the author is a person who demands more personal satisfaction out of life and the reader is supposed to be excited by the prospect of following that entitled pursuit.The dull, workman-like prose of the thing didn't make plodding through this thing particularly fun either.Step one of my own happiness project was recycling this book.;1
457607;Surely the best of the Bond pastiche that began with Kingley Amis' COLONEL SUN, this fine book by the British novelist William Boyd (BRAZZAVILLE BEACH, A GOOD MAN IN AFRICA ...) takes Bond to Africa and one of his most challenging adventures.  It's not a surprise Boyd writes well, certainly about Africa, but you may be surprised by how close he comes to the Fleming effect.Many of the Bond pastiche have been fun, but this is the first one that rivals, perhaps surpasses, Fleming himself.  This isn't high concept, but an actual Bond novel, exceptionally well written (Boyd's books always are), but also reminiscent of Fleming and the true literary Bond.  This one belongs on any Bond fan's shelf next to the originals.;1
440488;Wow, once in a great while I have the privilege of reading that rare can't-put-it-down book. This is one of those books.Candis Terry is a completely new author to me. I stumbled upon her via an email from Avon announcing some 99-cent books. I noticed the kitten sitting on a football and bought it immediately. I never expected it to be anything special, but I'd just finished a book and was in the mood for a sports romance. Boy, was I in for a treat with this book.First of all, I read some reviews for this book in which the readers were disappointed as the title of the book gives you the impression it's a Christmas romance. It isn't. In fact, only the first part of the book takes place over the holidays. The title is unfortunate because this author received some undeserved poor reviews because of the misleading title.I didn't care about that. Not one bit because she hooked me in the first chapter, and I never looked back. In fact, thanks to Ms. Terry I didn't get any writing done yesterday because I couldn't drag myself away from this book.I fell in love with Dean, the hero, in the first chapter and never stopped loving him. He was a real person, multi-dimensional, and the type of hero any writer would be proud to have created. An added bonus is that this writer actually knows her football.The heroine, Emma, was just as deep and enjoyable.I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this book. And Ms. Terry is now on my auto-buy list. I'm heading to Amazon right now to buy the other books in this series.;1

Lovely story about relationships, healing and love.;1
400707;"One Good Earl Deserves a Lover is the second book in Sarah MacLean's The Rules of Scoundrels series, set in a popular gaming hell. Sarah MacLean has quickly become one of my favorite historical romance authors. One Good Earl did not disappoint and I hard time putting this one down.The novel opens and we find Lady Philippa Marbury in the private office of Cross, notorious rake and part owner of The Fallen Angel. You see, Pippa has a problem. She's getting married in a week and doesn't know what to expect. A scientist at heart, Pippa doesn't like to go into a situation without all the facts. So she enlists Cross to help educate her on the rules of seduction and desire. Pippa is looking for an education without emotion but experiments sometimes have the most unexpected results.First off, I love the dedication to this book which his ""For girls who wear glasses."" I think that's the perfect setup for a book about a heroine who isn't like the other ladies of her peerage. Philllipa has a decidedly scientific mind and is more interested in learning about the muscles and bones in the human body then the latest London fashions. Pippa is a really unique and refreshing character. She's extremely smart and tenacious, but also sweet and a little bit nave. I think a lot of people will be able to relate to Pippa, a woman who's always felt a little out of place. I love that she doesn't try to change or compromise herself to fit in.Cross is an unlikely match for Pippa but ends up being quite perfect for her. He doesn't find Phillipa odd at all and instead admires her curiosity and intelligence. Unfortunately he has a few skeletons in his closet that he believes makes him unworthy of Pippa's love. Cross is an honorable man living with a lot of guilt from the past. He's also quite stubborn, which made me want to smack him a few times. But with a little bit of perseverance, Pippa manages to break down the walls that he's built. It should also be noted that Cross is a ginger. Yes, ginger. There aren't enough hot gingers in romance novels so thank you, Ms. MacLean.The romance in this was surprisingly sweet and the science talk made for some really cute love scenes. The only thing I wasn't really happy about was the resolution between Cross and his estranged family, or the lack of one. Cross's past is the thing that has kept him apart from society for so long and the thing that almost keeps him from Pippa. However, the issue all but disappears once Pippa and Cross finally get together. I have an e-ARC so maybe it'll be added in later, but the omission of it was something that I definitely noticed. Otherwise, this was a great read. Fun, sexy, and emotional, One Good Earl Deserves a Lover is all of the things I love and have come to expect from Sarah MacLean.*I received this book free of charge from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

His mission is to figure out why this is happening, and why him? Before this he was a nice kid who hadn't done anything to get bullied over.It all stems from the so-called ""Bully Book"", an instruction manual handed down from year to year telling how to become a bully, how to pick a victim, and how to get ahead by stepping on the other kids.WRITING STYLE:The book alternates between Eric's journal pages and pages from the bully book, giving you a good understanding of the relationship between the bully and the bullied, the thoughts and fears of both sides, and what drives them to do what they do.This book really opens you eyes to the world around you, and I'm sure that everyone can relate to someone in this book, whether it's Eric or the bullies, from your own experience or watching it happen to someone else.  You can tell that the author has had some bullying in his past from the way it's written with such real emotions and thoughts that will pull you into the story, making you interested in what will happen next, keeping you surprised through the twists and turns, and quite possibly will make you cry.  And then cry some more.RECOMMENDATIONS:I would truly recommend this book to anyone. Whether your an adult, teen, or child.  This book has the ability to impact you so strongly that you will never ever forget it.";1
194668;When you ponder the history of breadmaking, just consider the continuous creativity derived from mixing flour and water.  As author Brother Rick Curry, S.J., says, &quot,I'm reminded of the simplicity...A little flour and water and some other wholeseome ingredients make an infinte number of breads&quot,.&quot,The Secrets of Jesuit Breadmaking&quot, is a delightful collection of spiritual stories and easy to understand bread recipes.  Building on the mystique of the Jesuit religious order, Brother Curry kneads the spirtual life and writings of the order's founder Saint Ignatius Loyola into the recipe collection.  Indeed, this colection might be particularly interesting for those curious to know more about the Jesuits without having to read a long historical account.  At first, I was leary of the large number bread recipes presented because my success with breadmaking was non-existent. I thought, &quot,Why should I buy a book about breadmaking when I've never been able to get the dough to the first rise&quot,? Nevertheless, I wanted to try Brother Curry's recipe for Irish Soda Bread, cooked without yeast, so I purchased the book.  Of course, I could have simply copied the recipe without buying the book, but my religious side thought  this was being disingenuous. Now, I'm so glad I made the investment because reading the recipes is just as much fun as baking them.  Many recipes do not require using yeast, a relief for my breakmaking anxiety.  As I tired several different recipes, I became more confident to try at least one yeast recipe. Finally, voila, like a miracle, I actually make O'Brien's Oatmeal Bread!  Obviously, I'm now a convert to Brother Curry's recipes and, of course, I intend to try several more recipes as my breakmaking skills are tested.  I already have several handwritten notes in the margins of this book documenting my own experiences with the recipes. Thank you Brother Curry and and also to Brother John O'Brien, who was a &quot,vigorous&quot, teacher of Latin at Gonzaga Prep in Spokane Washington when Curry met him and learned his namesake Oatmeal Bread recipe. This is a good book for those needing to develop more faith in their breadmaking ability.  If you are already an expert breadmaker, Curry's collection is likely to sharpen the spiritual side of your God given talents.;1

67109;Some of the best advice is the simplest, yet our human frailties often make it the most difficult to recognize and follow. When confronting a decision, the most important thing to do is to make sure that all situational modifiers are absent and that you are looking at the conditions as they are, not as you want them to be. That can be a very difficult thing to do, there are enormous social and personal pressures pushing people into a state of denial. Sometimes the best thing that a person in authority can do is to admit that they do not know or understand. There is a natural tendency to think such an admission is equivalent to an admission of incompetence rather than one of relative competence and a facing of reality.These situations are the primary focus of this book, from determining how critical the decision is to verifying that all aspects and reasonable consequences of the decision are known. This requires a relaxing of the restrictions imposed by personal ego in favor of increasing the chances that the decision would be the correct one.The metaphor used in the book is of a group of people going on a hike, with the primary character being a young man that needs a bit of direction in his decision-making. A series of situations are set up where in each one he learns a little bit more about how to make decisions, and at the end the young man has enough confidence in himself to face the world and the problems that it presents.Making decisions is hard, the best alternative rarely waves a flag and announces itself. By reading this book and taking the advice very seriously, you stand a much better chance of identifying which alternative is the best one, independent of how obscure it might be.;1

318546;"I am a Jeaniene Frost/Bones fan and have read most of her books. I love the Bones and Cat series and when Ms. Frost brought out Firstr Drop of Crimson, I fell in love with Spade and the herione matched with Spade's energy.  So when Mencheres' story came out, I just had to read the book.  After all, he is a Master Vampire and ""older than dirt"" so he admits in making a joke to Kira, the heroine of the story and to which I really liked because she had strength without being a bitch which seems to happen in some other novels that I have read.  I will not go into detail of what the story is about, since others have done so.The problem that I have with this book is that I could not feel Mencheres' power like I feel with Bones as well as Spade and even Vlad.  As soon as Bones appeared in this story, one could feel his essense, his masculinity, the power radiating off of him.  Not so much so with Mencheres and he is supposed to be ancient.  There definitely was a different energy that Ms Frost created with this Hero.  That is what I did not care too much for with this book. But hey....you can't have everything.  Still, it is a good read.What I did like about this book is that the hero and herione are very much the main characters and are with each other mostly throughout the book, unlike the later books written by authors such as Laura Adrian where pages will fly by and no discussion of the two main characters but other characters and even the evil vamp in her stories. Sometimes, that is when one starts skimming the pages.  Not so with this book.  Whereas, in this book, the evil vamp appears and mostly with one or both of the two main characters.  Also, I thought that Mencheres and Kira went well together.  I did love their relationship.  It does take a bit before the love scenes but when it happens, it is well worth the wait.  Would I recommend this book?  Yes, in deed, I would.  I hope she brings out another book....perhaps Ian's story but he is such a rascal!";1
154386;"My head tells me that this is at most a 3star story but I'll give it a four because I think Harrison shows promise.  I liked it, well, parts of it but I feel cheated.  Rachel seems like Anita Blake's good twin.  There were times when I could barely distinguish the two sepatate characters.  I had read all of Harrison's book prior to reading Hamilton's series about Blake, but since reading most of the Blake series this summer I have come to realize just how suspiciously alike Anita and Rachel are and this disappoints me.  Points off for lacking orginality (in reviews of Hamilton's book I chastised the author for the main characters repeatedly saying things like ""yipee"" and ""riiiiight"" and instead offered The Hollows as a better read and here Harrison puts that crap in here!)  I don't believe that the story line was as bad as some reviewers have made it out to be, although it does lose ""flow"" after they rescue Nick.  I love the character progression of Jenks, however, the other characters are kind of stationary in this novel despite the Ivy/Anita occurence (nothing was really resolved.)  In summary, I think Harrison just wanted to deal with Nick in a way that he isn't a necessary charcter to include in the books to follow (hopefully) and then she can focus on everyone else (thankfully!)";1

481784;1943. The world is deep in the grip of World War II, and there are fears that the war may never end, that it might turn out to be another Hundred Years' War.John Easley is a journalist, deeply in love with his young wife, Helen. Yet when his younger brother is killed in the war, he struggles with his grief and his desire to ensure his brother's death wasn't in vain. He is determined to tell the U.S. a story of the war, particularly the Japanese occupation of the Aleutian Islands, which no one seems to know anything about, and reporters are sent away by the government.&#34,Action, he says, is the only language fit for love.&#34,Against Helen's wishes, after a brutal argument, John decides to head back to the Aleutians and find out just what is going on. Hiding his true identity, he travels with a crew on a bombing run, when his plane is shot down over the remote island of Attu. Forced to face the harshest of elements and hide from Japanese soldiers, John must figure out how to survive to tell the story he needs to, and honor his brother's memory and the memory of those whose lives were lost in the war. And at the same time, he ponders his love for Helen, and their marriage, deeply affected by his inability to share his grief with her.Meanwhile, back in Seattle, Helen is devastated by John's departure. While she tries to occupy her time caring for her elderly father, who suffered a stroke, she is desperate to find out where John is, and if he is okay. Yet the more she tries to find out where John has gone, or if he is okay, the more roadblocks she finds in her way. So she decides to do the only thing she can&#8212,try to find her way to the Aleutians, so she can find John and bring him back.&#34,Helen does not know how she is going to find him. She knows only that she must go there to do it.&#34,Helen uses every trick she can to get into Alaska. She, too, must hide her true identity to get there, and put her own safety at risk. She also must leave her father, uncertain whether she will ever see him again. But for her, the only thought is finding her husband and bringing him home.This is a tremendously compelling, beautifully written story about love, courage, determination, and finding the will to survive. It's amazing that for the majority of the book, John and Helen aren't together, except in reminiscences, yet their love story is so powerful. Brian Payton tells an excellent story, and this is a part of World War II I had no idea about. I felt drawn into the characters' struggles and emotions.It's interesting&#8212,so many movies are made from adaptations of books. I think this could be a beautiful movie, as long as it didn't lose the poetry of Payton's words. I really enjoyed this one.;1
40876;It's been a long five years.Since _A Storm of Swords_ was released in 2000, it's been long enough for fans around the world to imagine storyline resolutions, to decide how they want everything to happen over the rest of the series, and to despair of ever reading that series. It's been so long, and with so much expectation, that it would take a wizardly author to please everyone with a miraculous book. If _A Feast for Crows_ is not that book, George R.R. Martin is that author, and it's his own fault that almost nothing he could have produced after all this time would have been considered enough._A Storm of Swords_ ended on a knife point of prospect: Arya set sail for Braavos, leaving Sandor Clegane dying on the Trident's banks, Tyrion fled King's Landing for parts unknown, Bran trekked to the north in the company of Coldhands, and Sansa was trapped in the devious hands of Littlefinger atop the Eyrie. Danaerys, the other Lannisters, and the Ironborn were left in not much less disarray. Over its 900-plus pages, _Storm_ drove relentlessly to a breathless, brilliant finish._Feast_ is a quieter book, and not simply because it is missing half of the storylines in Bran, Tyrion, Dany, and Jon. Where _Storm_ raged, with river and fire and the bone-soaking rain of a dying summer, _Feast_ is the dry skittering of dead leaves. The armies that turned central Westeros into bloody mud are gone, and the soldiers and broken men that are left are going, although where, they may not know. This displacement pervades the book, even down to the chapter headings. Mr. Martin maintains the tradition of having a few central characters carry his chapters, in this case Arya, Sansa, Brienne, Jaime, Samwell, and Cersei, who thread throughout the book. However, for the first time there are single-instance headings for various of the Ironborn and Dornish: small glimpses into small characters. Even beyond this, the larger six headings are not always themselves: these people are wearing new faces or searching for them, and their paths and even names are ever-changing as they spin. Going home, or going bad, they're lost, and the way is anything but clear.The smallness isn't limited to the size of the story or the actions: it describes the characters themselves. Most of the big players, the ones who sweep over cities and mountains, are gone, and those who are left are brought low. King's Landing enacts like a petty town council, with base men feebly waving their arms where once great ones blazed.  The Iron Islands and Dorne have no heroes either, all seem villians or possible villians.  Mr. Martin has never given us merely black-and-white characters, but there are some who embody more hope than others. Those, Bran, Jon, and Dany, are missing from this _Feast_, and we are left with the vengeful, the reluctant, and the uncertain.  There are terrible moments here, and grisly fights with words and swords, but often even the deaths are numbed, those who lived most noisily dying with a whisper, a soft story told by another, not seen for ourselves. This does not lessen their impact, but it turns us into scavengers as well, scrabbling Mr. Martin's words to us in order to take every morsel from them we can._Feast_ is not _Storm_, nor is it the end of the series. It is not meant to contain the rest of the story that we've been waiting for, but to continue it, which it does, in its own way. It might be easy to dismiss its wandering characters as aimless and not worth the time, certainly not the time it took for them to finally arrive. But Mr. Martin knows exactly what he is doing here, as frustrating as it may be to us. Would _Feast_ have been a different book had publishing constraints not forced him to divide the story? Of course. Possibly it might have been better, and felt as complete as the others. But on its own, it is a powerful furtherance of Mr. Martin's deeply conscious world, and it works.  We need to see the affects of these wars on the smaller people they left behind: it wouldn't be enough to paint grand strokes again. The grief of _Storm_ was drummed into us with rain and battle, the poignancy of _Feast's_ vagabonds seeps in like the creaking of a bare gray branch in a cold wind. It's not as noticeable as an axe-blow to the head, but can harry the soul just as much.;1

Writing two engaging and distinct perspectives, and ending them with little cliffhangers such that you never want to stop reading. But something I really love about Split Second is that, because of the dual perspectives, we really get a feel for Laila's character and how truly damaged and complex she is.Also, Laila gets a love interest--Connor--in this one, and although I thought both he and his relationship with Laila were swoon-worthy, I did think it happened a little...spontaneously? Their chemistry was tangible throughout the entire novel, but it was really just a slow build-up to a kiss, and then Addie says their in love, and bam, they are. I don't know, it was just a little weird for me. I, personally, would have liked to see more of Laila experiencing those feelings for herself, instead of being told how she feels and then realizing how she feels, granted, that is how Laila's character is built--she's stubborn (in a good way, of course), and doesn't want to realize things that may place her in a vulnerable position. Either way, I still found their relationship to be entirely sweet and worthy of my swoons. That's just one little thing I have to nitpick there.Moving on to other romances in Split Second, we have Addie and Trevor. What I love about their relationship is that Kasie West is essentially building it from the ground up again, yet it doesn't feel boring or repetitive. With any other romance, written by any other author, it probably would have. But Kasie West has got this down, and she knows what she's doing with this relationship, and she does it damn well. Like Laila and Connor's romance, Addie and Trevor's is also a slow-build (much like it was in Pivot Point), but it's still just as swoony and adorable as it's always been.The plot in Split Second, I feel, is also an improvement upon Pivot Point's. Throughout the novel, even behind all of the swoons and snark and cuteness, there is a definite intensity. Especially after the ending of Pivot Point, you know that Kasie West is going to end this with an intense bang, but you don't know exactly what that will be. On one hand, we have Laila dabbling with illegalities and a charming boy with big secrets, and on the other hand, we have Addie dabbling with some illegalities and trying to win back the charming boy she had already won over before (unbeknownst to him).There's not much I can say about how intense Split Second's plot can be at times, but trust me when I say the intensity is there. Again, the ending isn't as big of a bang as the one in Pivot Point, but I think it's just as intense, if not more so. And, in my opinion, it's a perfect ending for this book. For this series? Really good, but not perfect, since there are still some loose ends to be tied up.Ultimately, Split Second absolutely did not disappoint, and I have trouble believing any novel Kasie West writes will. With snark written like no other, characters written like no other, and romances written like no other, Kasie West truly can do no wrong. All of her books prove to be amazing, and I have no doubt that her upcoming novels will be amazing as well. This, I am also certain of.;1
87919;I loved reading &#34,The Prince&#34, & &#34,Atlas Shrugged&#34, but these works meant so much more after reading the biographies of Machiavelli and Ayn Rand.  The same principle holds true with reading the autobiography of Michael Crichton (Travels).  It is great to learn where the visions come from.  For these three great writers, all of their visions came directly from experience.;1
141001;"Burma Road is really not a book about the Burma Road. It is a general and light overview of the entire Burma War. It's focus is primarily centred around the American contribution. But the great problem with this book is that the general reader would assume by its contents that America and all its actions in this war were the central actors in this Theatre.The million-person Anglo-Indian Army -- which cleared all of India in almost all of the major battles of this war is clearly underexplained. In this sense, altough a worthy effort, merely reinforces popular American mythology of how they ""won"" in this theatre of the war -- and does nothing to advance a higher understanding of how a Japanese Army of 300,000 (more than double that encountered by the American's on Okinawa) was defeated.If Donovan had started with the premise that this book was to be about the Burma Road and its place in the Burma War (as I assumed from the title of the book), then most of the battle detail is strong and certainly interesting. But in fact Webster tries to paint from a pallette describing the entire war in Burma, emphasising overwhelmingly the American contribution. While the battles leading up to the capture of Mytkiyina were brutal and certainly exciting, they are mere sideshows compared to those of Imphal, Kohima, Shaggy, Myktiela and the battle of the Pegu Yomas at the end of the war.The action and descriptions fly a little too fast and furious for my liking as well. Orde Wingate is described  (before being appointed to head special warfare unit) as the ""most controversial officer in the British Army"" -- which outside of the people who knew him was clearly not the case -- he was a minor oddball Colonel (and sometimes Major, and largely unknown) until Wavell, Slim and later Churchill picked him for greater things.There is an almost 1950s narrative history feel about his book. All battles are ""hell,"" all moves by the allies ""brilliant"" and the Japanese (perhaps the finest light infantry in the world) just a bunch of ham- fisted Banzai-charging fanatics. The situation of the Chindit defence of Blackpool was ""perfectly"" positioned -- which as any reader of history at this time knows be exactly the opposite of reality (see Michael Calvert's ""Prisoners of Hope""). Donovan has clearly not done his elementary study of the Burma war to get this wrong. More than a few British officers lived with the infamy of the poor siting of Blackpool.Some of the narrative is factually incorrect. We have Webster numbering Japanese troops in a division to ""1000 men"" (moreover he does this at least twice in the book?!). We have him describing Mountbatten as the leader of the ""highly successful raid on Dieppe""??? Again -- Donovan is writing about things he clearly has not read.He states that the war in Asia started on December 10th?? (Actually it started on the 08th). He states that, even as the Japanese were advancing into Burma, they were losing much tonnage as a result of the Flying Tigers (AVG) flying over the South China Sea and bombing shipping headed for Burma (again totally factually incorrect). Much later in the war the 23rd Fighter Group made raids over Hanoi, but at the beginning stages of the Burma battle the AVG never sunk a single ship.( I think that he is mixing up the missions of the AVG with the latter, much larger 10th and 14th USAAF units that certainly did wreek havoc over SE Asia). A reference to Brian Cull's ""Bloody Shambles"" - a history of air operations over Burma (or any standard study of the war) -- would have sorted him out on this point, but its not in the bibliography. In addition the massive Royal Airforce which included airmen and women for all over the commonwealth is not even mentioned.This theatre was even more complicated that others, but the intracies of this are not explained at all. In fact the Burma Road itself would have been a excellent vehicle to compare, contrast and describe the wranglings over strategy and command splitting that went on in this front. A person reading this book would be forgiven if they thought that Stillwell was Supreme Theatre Commander or even subordinate to anyone outside the US Chain of command. He in fact reported to Archie Wavell (though he did break the chain of command quite frequently).Most importantly, Webster seems to have talked with a lot of people about his subject. But by the paltry bibiography he has clearly not mastered the literature of his study: how anyone could write a book on the Burma War and not cite Louis Allan's ""Burma: The Longest War"" is beyond me. He also uses compendium Secondary Sources such as Chinnery's ""March or Die"" and Rooney's ""Burma Victory."" The latter is again an overview book and extremely prejudicial in favour of Orde Wingate,but both do not include any original reasearch on the war. Most of the information on Stillwell was gleaned from Barbara Tuchman's tour de force ""Stillwell and the American Experience in China"" -- which gives you a better feel for the man, the campaign and the politics of this theatre.The one area I give Webster his due, is that he sorts out the niave American interpretation of the Chindits and Stillwell's opinion that ""limey's do not fight"" -- Webster explains excruciating Chindit battle for Moguang, who, unlike their American cousins, fought for four months, many times with no direct support. From 1200 fighters Brig. Michael Calvert emerged with almost 50 effectives at the end of the battle.The clearing of the Hunkwang valley was only a sideshow. In the end the British cleared all of lower Burma from offensives launched out of the Akyab corridor and the Imphal plain -- all with traditional army units (including the last Chindit operation). They cut Burma in half and forced the Japanese to withdraw from Northern Burma before utterly destroying the Japanese in the brilliant battle of Myktiela. This does not mean the honour or sacrifices of those who fought the Northern campaigns is any less than those of others -- it does however seem to vindicate British strategy.Do not get me wrong. I liked the book, but this description of the Burma War is only a very small exciting part of a very, very large war that dwarfs many of the personalities and events in this book. It is an exciting series of battles and personalities. But in sum the American contribution was local, and contributed little in the defeat of Japan in Burma. That it was glorious is beyond quesion.For those who want to know more about the Marauders I reccomend Orgill's book of the same name. For those about the American contribution on what the Americans call the CBI (not used outside of the US I'm afraid), you couldn't do better than Tuchman's ""Sand Against the Wind.""";1

466088;"I must confess it took me quite awhile to open up to our main guy, Damian, due to his outlook on life and the way he blamed everyone for his problems.  When he reached his majority, he inherited his beloved mother's homeplace, ""Beaulieu,"" but gambled it away on a night of excess debauchery while out with bosom buddies, Julian and Robert.  When he comes to his senses the next morning, he is chastened and man enough to face his father, the current Earl of Windermere with the hard cold facts of his irresponsibility.  In fact, his father was what I would consider gracious - he didn't excuse him but instead, assisted Damian in obtaining a position with the Foreign Office, believing in time that Damian might be able to purchase the property back.For his part, Damian blamed Julian and Robert for his own foolishness and their longtime friendship ended.  For the next six years, Damian worked and traveled on behalf of the Foreign Office and when he eventually had the funds to purchase ""Beaulieu"" back, it was denied him by the current owner -  a wealthy businessman, Joseph Chorley - who wanted to purchase a title for his family.  Damian could have Beaulieu but the price would be marriage to Chorley's niece, Cynthia.  Thus, Damian married the young woman although he was about as close to disgusted as one might get with the entire situation.Of course, Cynthia was the one to suffer.  She wasn't raised to be a lady - her hair, her clothes, her French were not up to snuff.  Damian gave the marriage two weeks before he decided he could not endure it any longer - bless his teeny, tiny heart. During the two week period, he demanded he and Cynthia speak French so that she could improve her efforts for after all, she was now a diplomat's wife.  He took her to bed every night but didn't see that she received pleasure and then he departed to far off lands - Persia, in fact - to get away from his awful life - bless his teeny, tiny heart.One year passes and Damian is called back home by the Foreign Office.  Before he checks in with his wife, he dines with his head at the foreign office who tasks him with a new job, and then sends Damian off to escort his wife, Belinda - and Damian's previous paramour - to the opera. While at the opera, Damian sees his old friend, Julian, now Duke of Denford, hanging out with a lovely woman that he eventually recognizes as his wife, Cynthia.  This does not set well with Damian who has had some time to realize he never gave his marriage a chance and wants to try and make a go of it.  But, the pigeons have come home to roost and Cynthia is not quite the little drab he left behind. Plus, Cynthia has a specific wound to her soul for which she cannot forgive Damian.  Whether or not Damian is guilty of this misdeed is one that I won't reveal in this review.  But it has preyed upon Cynthia's soul and contributed to the person she has become.What to say about this story?  I must admit to being really dialed into the storyline - the writing is really great.  There were some things I didn't like:  Although Cynthia had worked really hard on her personal appearance, was a very generous soul and was very willing to forgive Damian, her character might have pleased me more had she hung him out to dry a little longer.  Yes, I thought Damian should have had to work a little harder to get back into Cynthia's good graces.  He refuses to believe she and Julian have not engaged in an affair.  He had plans to give some erotic pictures to his former paramour, Belinda, and accepted a dinner invitation to her home and insisted Cynthia attend with him, although Cynthia was fully aware of his and Belinda's former relationship.  I didn't like that.I did like it that very early on, we learned that Damian had remained celibate the year he was gone from Cynthia.  I also liked it that even though he fully believed Cynthia and Julian had been involved in an affair, he was willing to continue trying to make his marriage work and refused to give Cynthia up.  I liked it that he engaged in fisticuffs with Julian over her and finally, he began to win me over with his steadfast approach to win Cynthia.I decided to give the book 5 stars but it was more like 4 1/2.";1

574682;"Mark Zandi's ""Financial Shock"" delivers on its promise of providing a 360 degree look at the subprime mortgage crisis. Zandi was also right in calling the subprime mortgage crisis the nation's motion significant economic crisis since the Great Depression. Given the publication release date, he was also prescient in predicting that the Federal government would not let Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac go under. Zandi's depiction of the whirling vortex surrounding the subprime crisis reveals that at its zenith, the business of mortgage and mortgage investment was nothing more than a colossal Ponzi scheme. The maddeningly ironic thing about the business of speculating in mortgages was that this was an idea that was the basis for a startup business at Enron (See Brian Cruver'sAnatomy of Greed: Telling the Unshredded Truth from Inside Enron).As astute as Zandi's analysis is, in an astounding stroke of misguided optimism, Zandi also concludes that the ""worst"" was over. Given his analysis, the logical conclusion was that the ripple effect from the subprime mortgage crisis and the fall of Bear Stearns would have a ripple effect on financial markets and institutions (an aftershock if you will). Shortly after its release, Lehman Brothers, AIG and the State of New York all went into the tank. It begs the question, did he really believe that the worst was over or were other forces at work?";1

541280;I am a bit torn by this book.The pros: I absolutely love the first half of the book. It is totally enjoyable. I love reading from the pov of an autistic child. It totally reminds of my daughters line of thinking (she has autism as well). The tangents she goes on and her form of logic which to most is completely illogical. I love how it portrays the difficulties of raising a child with autism.The cons: quite a bit of language. This is not really a mystery. It focuses more on the inner thoughts of a boy with autism. This didn't really bother me much but it was labeled as a mystery you solve the mystery in the first half of the book. I'm also a little concerned about his fascination with his knife and desire to use it on almost everyone. I am also saddened by the story. His home life is pretty messed up. It focuses a lot on the negative.All in all it was a decent read. Probably mean more to those who know someone with autism or are interested in them. Not everyone would enjoy this book. He goes off on tangents often and makes lots of lists and diagrams. These were some of my favorite parts because it reminded me of my daughter. I just hope that those who do read it don't stereotype all autistics this way. My daughter shares a lot of similarities. But the obsession with violence (always wanting to hit or knife someone who touches him), lack of feelings (most I have known just have trouble expressing them, but experience lots) and reasoning that the idea of God is just silly are not common with all those affected.  This opens up the mind of ONE autistic child, not all.;1

This is a good book to have around if you or someone that you know wants to have a (small) pet of some kind.  It is unlikely that they will recognize you or respond to you, but they will be interesting to observe!  The book says, in part, ""Most, if not all, will never learn to recognize you.

434909;"Jim Collins is one of the most influential business thinkers of our time. His distinct methodology of identifying matched pairs of companies to shed light on how and why high performers behave differently has captivated the readers of his best sellers, Built to Last, Good to Great, and How the Mighty Fall. The contrast between what works and what doesn't work creatively encapsulated in compelling visuals such as the ""Flywheel"" or the ""Hedgehog Concept"" has provided harried executives with much needed insights and grounding in an increasingly complex world.Collins's latest book, Great by Choice, co-authored with Morten T. Hansen, once again employs the now familiar matched pairs methodology to contrast seven pairs of companies and focuses on how high performers master unstable environments. This research effort is clearly worthy, given the sudden emergence of the unprecedented combination of accelerating change and escalating complexity over the past decade. However, because the matched pairs methodology requires longitudinal data from publically traded companies, the research period for this latest study covers the 30-year period between 1972 and 2002. Unfortunately, the conclusions derived from the research may be of limited value today because they are based on the untested assumption that the world before and after 2002 is essentially the same. This may explain why in this latest study, Microsoft is the high performer and Apple is the contrasting comparison company.Like the proverbial person who looks under the lamppost to find his keys because the light is better there, Collins and Morten fall prey to a methodological bias that systematically blinds them to the most important business realities of our time. Had the study focused on the past decade, it's more likely that Apple would be the high performer and Microsoft the comparison company, and if the methodology had been designed to include privately held firms, then businesses such as W. L. Gore & Associates, Linux, or Wikipedia - who are primary forces in the reinvention of management and the redefinition of leadership for a hyper-connected world - may have yielded more relevant observations.Throughout the book, the authors draw insights for their conclusions from the sagacious actions of heroic individuals, such as Herb Kelleher of Southwest Airlines and Andy Grove of Intel. In particular they focus on two instances of extreme physical challenges where the choices of contrasting individual leaders were the difference between life and death for their teams. In the first instance, the authors contrast the discipline behind Roald Amundsen's unprecedented expedition to and from the South Pole in 1911 with the contemporaneous journey led by Robert Falcon Scott that tragically perished in the extreme cold. In the second instance, Collins and Morten compare the actions of a little known production team led by David Breashers, who achieved the incredible goal of shooting an IMAX film on top of Mount Everest, and the calamity of the Everest expedition led by Rob Hall and Scott Fischer, notably chronicled in Jon Krakauer's book, Into Thin Air.An unspoken assumption in the Collins and Hansen's research is that the past is a proxy for the future. According to this assumption, analysis of historical trends is the portal to future success, which may explain why traditional managers love data-driven forecasts. Until recently, this assumption has been a reasonable management guide. Given the relatively slower pace of change of the world before the Internet, the past did serve well as a proxy for the future. However, we now suddenly find ourselves in a hyper-connected fast-changing wiki world where the unprecedented has become commonplace. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Wikipedia, YouTube, iTunes, and Skype - none of which existed or could be forecasted as we celebrated the birth of new millennium a mere dozen years ago - are the harbingers of the new rules of a very different world where the past is clearly no longer a proxy for the future.The revolutionary dynamics that define our new wiki world are that nobody is smarter or faster than everybody and that networks are far smarter and faster than hierarchies. That's why Wikipedia has displaced traditional encyclopedias, why the late-entry Google became the world's most popular search engine, and why, this past summer, a group of online gamers leveraging their collective intelligence took only three weeks to solve a molecular problem in AIDS research that had evaded the world's most intelligent individual scientists for over a decade. In a post-Internet world, just as the past is no longer a proxy for the future, the smartest organizations are no longer those with the smartest individuals. Today's smartest companies are those who know how to aggregate and leverage their collective intelligence.Research focused on how the choices of the smartest individuals are the key ingredient behind great companies provides very limited lessons in a world reshaped by digital technology. The intelligence of highly skilled heroic leaders may still be preferable when it comes to leading physical expeditions. However, when the key challenge facing business executives is mastering the complexities of fast-changing times, the relevant leadership lessons are more likely to come from the new breed of leaders who build networks leveraging collective intelligence rather than hierarchies amplifying the individual smarts of heroic leaders. And when we understand these lessons, we are likely to discover that creating great companies is more about organizational design than individual choice.Few of the networked companies being built by this new breed of leaders have 30-year histories and many are not publically traded firms. Nevertheless, the secrets behind their innovative approaches to creating great companies in a post-digital world are the lessons that are most needed for our time. Perhaps it's time for Collins and Hansen to step out from under the ""light of the lamppost"" and adapt their methodology to enlighten us about the new rules and the new realities of the wiki world. Their insights into the discipline and the habits of a new breed of great companies and their leaders would be most welcome and certainly very valuable.Rod CollinsAuthor, Leadership in a Wiki World: Leveraging Collective Knowledge to Make the Leap to Extraordinary Performance";1
516514;I used this product along with case files psych. I sometimes referred to the Kaplan and Saddock book and found that FA psych is like having a high yield version of this very book. I was expecting FA to be high yield and was pleased to see it take after the book that both my school and attending had wanted me to be following (ie - Kaplan and Saddock).The best thing about this book for me are the mini cases in the side notes. They were a nice way to quickly review subjects I didn't want to spend a lot of time on. I am little suprised that some of the mnemonics from FA step 1 were not present, but most are.The only negative (and this doesn't just pertain to this book)is that I don't think there is really any one good book to completely help you ace this clerkship, but by adding case files psych I was pleased.;1
93074;"This book will be especially valuable to those who have a keen interest in ""the amazing rise and scandalous fall of Enron."" I also commend to their attention McLean and Elkind's The Smartest Guys in the Room. Whereas Smith and Emshwiller explored the same company as investigative reporters, McLean and Elkind seem (to me) to have approached their subject as corporate anthropologists. Both books reach many of the same (albeit somewhat tentative) conclusions as to what happened...and why.Two significant differences are that Smith and Emshwiller limit their attention primarily to a period in 2001 extending from October 16th (when Enron announced huge losses caused by two partnerships) to December 2nd (when Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy), McLean and Elkind cover a two-year period of the company's ""amazing rise and scandalous fall."" Also, McLean and Elkind devote far more attention to each of the ""smartest guys"", Smith and Emshwiller seem less interested in them, except in terms of the impact of their mismanagement and corruption. Let's say there are two books about the collapse of the twin towers at the World Trade Center, one focuses on the human tragedies associated with it whereas a second book addresses design, construction, and structural issues. Obviously, both approaches are valid.In certain respects, this book reminds me of Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward's All the President's Men. In both, the reader is provided with a rigorous and comprehensive examination of the process by which investigative journalists generate, evaluate, and pursue leads, then tell a ""story"" based on the material they have accumulated. Smith and Emshwiller are the focal points in this book. Their reader feels as if she or he accompanies them each step of the way (at least I did) as they methodically probe ever more deeply into Enron's immensely complicated corporate infrastructure. As already suggested, their focus is less on the personalities of the deal makers than on the deals they made, also on how and why they were able to conceal various illegalities and improprieties long before December 3rd, 2001, when Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.For me, one of the most interesting subjects which Smith and Emshwiller discuss is Arthur Andersen's association with Enron to which they devote several chapters. Given the nature and extent of Enron's financial implosion, what role did its longtime auditor play? And what about other reputable firms such as Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Merrill Lynch which were also centrally involved with Enron's senior managers as they methodically and relentlessly constructed what has since been called ""a house of cards""? Smith and Emshwiller could not have possibly provided definitive answers to questions such as these when their book went to press. Perhaps those answers will not be fully revealed for years to come.I am grateful for the opportunity to learn what I did from this book. My personal preference, however, is for McLean and Elkind's The Smartest Guys in the Room because I have a greater interest in the who and why rather than the how and when. Nonetheless, I highly recommend both books and presume to suggest that 24 Days be read first.";1
159679;I began reading Patricia Sprinkle's books when she was writing the Sheila Travis series (loved it....great plots and humor!).  I then introduced myself to McLauren Yarbrough and visited her often in that series (truly wonderful!!!!).  Loving history and genealogy, I knew this series was right up my alley.....and it is!  Sprinkle's characters become good friends of mine.  They are real, and I enjoy visiting them so much.  I highly recommend all three series to any cozy mystery lover.;1
372846;The book arrived in the mail last week. I tore open the shipping package to find a ornately wrapped package with a seal. When a book comes specially wrapped this way there's only two things it could be--a treasure or a disappointment.The Oracle of Stamboul is the first novel from Michael David Lukas. The story takes place in the late nineteenth century and begins with the magical and simultaneously violent birth of Eleonora Cohen. Raised by her father and step-mother/aunt in Constanta, Eleonora learns quickly and remembers everything she reads or hears. Fluent in seven languages, Eleonora is a young savant.The plot moves to Stamboul, the capital of the declining Ottoman empire, when Eleonora's father travels there for business and Eleonora stows away on the ship. While in Stamboul, Eleonora and her talents will come to the attention of the Sultan.The novel flows steadily along. The language is beautiful in its simplicity and melodious tone. The characters are charming, fascinating and entirely believable in spite of being completely unique. The reader cannot help but fall in love with the delightful and quiet character of Eleonora. The mysteries are intriguing and the setting is in itself inspiring and magical. All things necessary to create a fabulous literary work.However, while I appreciated Eleonora's ultimate ending, I felt that the climax is weak and many of the mysteries are left unanswered and simply left to dangle loose at the end. The reader is left to wonder what might have been, which is probably the point.The novel left me with plenty of things to think about and would make a great book to read for book groups because of the possible discussions regarding predestination, personal choice and how ultimately one person can effect and change history.Lukas is a skilled story teller and I look forward to reading his future works.;1
143434;This book is the best fantasy book I've ever read. It has very well developed characters and a unique plot that spins the reader into a vortex of imagination, humor, and fun. It has unlikely characters that you can watch develop while the story line twists and turns that keeps you from looking past the next bend. The ending was surprising and the book was very neatly wrapped up. A thoroughly enjoyable read that made me laugh and cry along with the characters. You honestly feel like you're inside the book, alongside the characters with their conflicts. Diana Wynne Jones has done a wonderful accomplishment creating such a fantastic book, a page turner that is the best book I've read in a long time.It begins with an eldest daughter named Sophie, stuck into thinking that the eldest daughters have the dullest lives. She works in her family's hat shop, making beautiful and popular hats for the local women. Then,adventure comes when she angers the Witch of the Waste, and gets cursed to be an old woman.So the adventure starts, with Sophie meeting the wizard Howl, and finding plenty of mystery and adventure inside his castle, including striking a deal with a fire demon, fleeing from a scarecrow, and meeting the Witch of the Waste, while discovering her own magic.A tale of romance and self-discovery, this book is highly recommended. The best book by D.W.J. yet.;1
384682;With an interesting premise and some strong writing, I really wanted to like this book much more than I actually did. I think this came about for a variety of reasons. First, the &#34,powers&#34, tended to be often so strong as to seriously stress my ability to suspend disbelief. Second, we switch point of view so much that it gets more difficult to really connect with the characters. Third, we never get anything but teasing hints about the bad guys' motivations to act as they do, so they end up feeling like cardboard cutouts. Last, the ending thumps a bit but does not resound. In fact, it made me feel as though the entire book was just a setup for the next book.I think many will like the book okay, but it was a disappointment that the author failed to develop so many possibilities and left so much hanging.;1
21521;It seems a bit redundant to heap more accolades on Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall, the 2009 Mann Booker prize winner, but the author has done such an extraordinary job of portraying the characters and events in 16th century England that it cannot be helped. Mantel weaves two strong story lines that intertwine and become inseparable. The most compelling is that of the rise to power of Thomas Cromwell. Born of humble origins to a blacksmith father who beats him viciously and regularly, Cromwell ran away and began one of the most remarkable ascents in English history. After a long period abroad, where he learned many useful things, Cromwell lands under the wing of the powerful Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, adviser to King Henry VIII. Cromwell reveres Wolsey, but loses his support when Wolsey falls into disfavor. When Wolsey dies in disgrace, Cromwell makes note of those who participate in his downfall. Even without the protection of his mentor, Cromwell quietly amasses power, eventually becoming Henry's trusted right hand man. All along the way he keeps careful tabs on those who deride him for his humble origins, and those who do so pay a steep price.The parallel story is that of Henry VIII and his frantic search for a male heir. His wife, Catherine gives him a daughter who will eventually become Queen Mary, but Henry wants a son. He divorces Catherine and marries Anne Boleyn, an act that ultimately drives a wedge between Rome and the Church of England.Some of the important characters are portrayed differently than I would have expected. In particular, Thomas More, who is cast in a very favorable light in A Man for all Seasons, comes across as cold and heartless, someone who deserves execution and gets it.The book is paced nicely and held my attention throughout. That said, I had some confusion keeping up with the characters. There are lots of Thomases, lots of Marys, and sometimes the speakers were not identified as clearly as I would have liked, so I had to backtrack to catch up. Even so, three cheers (and five stars) for Mantel for a job well done. I look forward to the sequel.flag;1
630159;As a Rome-based freelance writer who frequently publishes articles about the Vatican and its history, I knew I needed a good reference book to help me recognize saints in history, art, and tradition and understand why they are important. I did some research to decide between this volume, the Oxford Dictionary of Saints, and the Delany's Pocket Dictionary of Saints and I decided to buy this one.Then some time passed, and I decided I needed still more information and so I bought the Oxford version about a year later. And six months ago the Delaney edition found its own place in my book shelf. And do you know what? After familiarizing myself with the new additions to my religious library on their arrival, I have hardly opened either of the Penguin edition's rivals.To be clear, none of these books contains all the information in the other two, but I believe this edition -- in terms of authoratative (even if sometimes brief) biographical information, good organization, data on symbolism related to saints, a helpful glossery of terms, and an impressive bobliography -- is the best to have if you'll only buy one book.As another reviewer here pointed out, the book's great weakness is its lack of significant information about patron saints. And that's important, because many lay people first decide to learn more about the lives of saints because of the patron saint of some area of interest (the Delaney book is best in that regard).But I believe that flaw is more than compensated for by the book's strengths. At the risk of envoking a tired cliche, the book is written in a fact-packed and yet accessible style that makes it a good option for the novice and a valuable resource for more experienced saint watchers.;1
198489;Honest and candid, Barry Williams gives us a funny, entertaining viewpoint of growing up as Greg Brady of &quot,The Brady Bunch.&quot, What I like about this book is that he tells of his start in show business, then details life as part of &quot,The Brady Bunch&quot,. He expresses amazement that people still love and want to see the Brady Family which resulted in several made-for-TV Brady movies with the old cast and the hilarious Brady Bunch movies with Shelly Long as Carol Brady. Of course Williams describes his crush on Maureen McCormack as well as other Brady Kid pairings once the cameras stopped rolling. It must have been frustrating for him and for the other actors portraying the Brady kids because most of them were not like their characters at all, yet the public expected them to behave that way. Can you picture that Thweet Little Thindy (Susan Olsen) is now a hard-drinking woman? Williams tells of them swapping Brady stories over drinks on an airplane. The only thing I didn't like was at the end of the book, a synopsis of each Brady Bunch episode was included to plump up the book. While that info might be useful for die-hard Bradyphiles, I would have preferred that Williams give us more anecdotes about his life as Greg Brady or better yet, life after Greg Brady, since the bulk of the book is focused on the Brady Years.;1

255926;"`The Bucolic Plague` is entertaining. On page 34 Josh and his boyfriend are trying to figure out how to pay for a bucolic million-dollar farm/mansion in a small town along the Hudson just north of Manhattan, and has an idea: ""I could write a book about a high-powered advertising executive and his vice president boyfriend who cashed it all in to lead simpler lives as gentleman farmers. It would be a bestseller. I would get rich. I'd live in a mansion."" It's true they cashed in on farming on one sense, the book is now a tie-in to an upcoming real-life TV series with stints on the Martha Stewart show.The urbanite back to rural life is a real phenomenon that is popular right now. Many young people are giving up the city and starting farms, making sacrifices and enacting real change in how we grow and buy food. Unfortunately this book is not an authentic representation of that movement, the farm is just a means to an end: far from giving up the city life, it is really about self-promotion by riding the wave of interest in boutique farming to TV personality stardom. It offered little for me other than an entertaining romp with some Manhattan advertising executives who are charming and witty, the writing is often funny. I felt it lacked authenticity and was more like a stunt book.";1

86086;Too often romance writing focuses on the alpha male. You know - the tall, handsome, assertive, slightly domineering guy who sweeps the heroine off her feet. But what about the beta male? The guy who's sensitive, understanding and heck! an all-around good guy?Well, this collection celebrates the beta male archetype and hopes to prove that they can as interesting as an alpha.Lisa Kleypas pulls two characters from my favourite series - Dr. Jake Linney from the Bow Street Runners series and Lydia Craven (daughter of Derek and Sara Craven from Dreaming of You) for her part of the anthology. Lydia is getting married... for all the wrong reasons. Everyone knows it, except for Lydia. That includes Jake Linney, an admired physician. This is a tale of a headstrong intellectual pitted against a compassionate romantic and how the two can complement each other. Although not as good as her full novels, it is a satisfying enough read for those who wondered what ever happened to some of the characters from her previous novels.Perhaps the strongest story is written by Kinley MacGregor. She writes an endearing tale of a knight in the shadows who admires his ladylove from afar. Simon Ravenwood has always played second fiddle. Lacking confidence, he woos Kenna under the guise of another knight, Stryder. Not realizing that she is being duped, Kenna mistakenly announces her engagement to Stryder. Simon must overcome his fear to win the woman of his heart.The least satisfying of the three was by Julia Quinn. The story follows Ned who falls in love with his fiancee's sister Charlotte. Inane banter between the two main characters made the supposedly passionate encounters completely unbelievable.To be honest, if it were the two first stories, I would have given this book at least a 4. However, Julia Quinn's poor showing makes this collection a 3 for me.;1

135314;Mr. A's 8th grade class read this book and, as a whole, liked the action and pacing of the book.

609641;"The author has done painstaking research into many old journals, diaries, and letters to produce a vivid history of the rivalry for the spice trade in the Molucca Islands (now called Maluku in eastern Indonesia) around 1610. Along the way, he notes some interesting ""probable firsts"" that could be claimed by the captains and sailors in this tale: the use of lime juice to prevent scurvy, the observation of sunspots, and even the amateur performance of Shakespeare.Hype about this book appears on the back cover, where the publisher explains that the tiny island of Run (pronounced Roon) was ultimately swapped for Manhattan, confirmed in the Treaty of Breda. As a native New Yorker resident in Indonesia, I find that information fascinating but I think the book would have been just as interesting if this marketing angle hadn't been exploited by the author.Chapter 1 provides a thorough backdrop by summarizing 16th century explorations but the ""update"" of the quest for the Northeast and Northwest Passages in Chapter 6 is way too detailed, turning the whole chapter into a digression. I get the feeling Giles Milton's purpose in writing it was to weave Henry Hudson into the story.As several reviewers pointed out, non-linear chronology disrupts what would otherwise be a fast-paced account of history. The author's desire to explain the confluence of events in opposite parts of the globe produces awkward branching in the storytelling: several pages flow for months or years in one direction, and then Milton jumps backwards to an earlier point in time to show how a related event unfolded. Some branching is inevitable because communications with the ""home office"" required year-long voyages, leading to the strategy of launching new fleets before previous ones returned.The main character doesn't appear until page 202. Aside from giving the title catchy alliteration, Nathaniel Courthope's inclusion in the book as leader of the heroic but futile defense of Run serves mainly to romanticize the story and create a climax: the swap that turned New Amsterdam into New York. I'm sure this boosted sales in New York, but the previous 200 pages were already a highly readable account of the ""spice race."" Curiously, the British swap of Bencoolen (their source of pepper in southwest Sumatra since the 1680s) for Malacca isn't even mentioned in the epilogue, I guess readers in Malaysia weren't part of the marketing plan.Despite the hype, and beyond the swashbuckling, this book leads the reader to consider many aspects of the Age of Discovery besides money and politics. Although Milton quite naturally is biased toward his native England, he is honest enough to report some of the British atrocities while enumerating the many Dutch ones. He is also quite open about the lack of unity among his compatriots, which led to indecisiveness: fleets were small compared to those from Holland, and captains within a fleet sometimes hesitated to risk their own ships in battle because financial gain overruled nationalism.Numerous issues related to intercultural communication hover beneath the surface of the story. For example, the future Indonesians in Banda used Malay and Portuguese as lingua francas but how did Japanese pirates and mercenaries communicate with Europeans in the degree of detail that Milton describes?Although flair was a plus in bridging cultural gulfs between European merchants and Asian rulers, it seems the biggest risk in many trading ventures was taking sides in local feuds (as Magellan did), not making behavioral faux pas. The only cross-cultural blunders recounted in this book were two cases of butchering a cow in a Hindu community to feed hungry sailors, the rest of the problems were due to greed, cruelty, panic, prejudice, and other failures of character that are present in all cultures and universally recognizable.Thus, reflecting on this book leads me to question the value of ""taboo avoidance"" as the key feature in preparing modern business travelers for overseas ventures. Inaccurate translations and intercultural misunderstandings were the rule not the exception in the 1600s, yet trade flourished. Tolerance for mistakes is far greater today, when people in nearly every culture have seen ""foreigners"" on TV in movies and the news.";1

A book that is hard to stop listening to and each time you do break, you look forward to the next time you will get to listen to more.I recommend this book highly for all readers who have an interest, however, be advised that as with most military books, at times there is harsh language so definitely PG-13+ rating.  Not overly violent but very candid about the difficulties in the geopolitics and the physical and mental strain one undergoes when training for special forces, much like our Seal teams or England's MI6.

71086;Mark Urban has added another great book to the many titles competing to be placed in a Napoleonic library. This book, `The Man Who Broken Napoleon's Codes' covers a little known and written of subject, the story of George Scovell. This man had as much to do with the British victories in Spain as did Wellington although you would not know it if you read any previous accounts of the Peninsular War.George Scovell helped break the French Imperial codes and provided much useful intelligence to Wellington in his campaigns against the French armies. But since Scovell was of low birth he struggled for advancement. He showed his bravery on a number of battlefields but was almost always forgotten when it came to promotion, being passed over by younger men of more distinguished birth.I must admit that I was a bit dubious when I started reading this book as I usually find accounts on code breaking and intelligence quite dull and boring however this book reads like a novel. Full of information with a narrative that races along, it was a great story and full of action. The book covers all the major campaigns and battles in the Peninsular and was a joy to read. I have no hesitation in recommending this book to anyone who loves reading about the Napoleonic period.;1

433901;Though I had always wanted to try a Leonard book, never had the chance but decided to try with Raylan, the lead character in the Justified television series that is based on an Elmore Leonard short story.  I really like Leonard's style.  He makes the reader work a bit using description and dialogue to learn what is going on or why a character is acting a certain way rather than providing a lot of back story via narrative.Watching the Justified series helps a good bit toward this as well but the book stands alone quite nicely.  There are pieces of recent stories from Justified in this book which is a bit disappointing in that I would have preferred something new - a further development of the character or a new plot.  Instead Leonard combines elements of last year's series with the new season to weave a new story.The story comes across as a series of vignettes rather than concentrating on a central narrative, perhaps something the author is trying to do to establish Raylan as a series of novels separate from the television show.  Certainly, they all relate but it is a little strange to see characters that have now more fully developed in the TV show as almost starter characters here.  For example, the character of Boyd Crowder reverts to that of the character from earlier in the second TV series rather than the more fully developed sinister character he is now.  The same is true of the character of Raylan's ex-wife, who has a very small role in this book.Still a good story that is entertaining, fast paced and absorbing and worth a read.;1
582848;My favorite book in this category of history is Kurlansky's Salt. Sweetness and Power is another book along those lines, but it doesn't live up to the former. I am a HISTORY fan, and this book is more like an ANTHROPOLOGY. It touches on the history of the sugar industry but is more focused on how sugar has impacted human culture. If you prefer anthropology, you should give this a read, but I'd advise history fans to stay away. Not to be completely negative, I truly enjoyed the information on tea and it's impact in England. The info on tea was more interesting to me than the sugar.;1

But even well done sloppines is too good of a term for her work in the twenty-first century.

71214;"First of all, I should state that I am a Christian, so certainly there were going to be some areas that I disagreed with the conclusions of two orthodox Jews, including a rabbi. (I am friends with a rabbi from the conservative branch, and we think alike in many different ways despite the fact that we disagree on many issues of theology.) But except for the additional analysis that could have been given from the Christian New Testament, there's not much more I could add to what the authors had to say here. Dr. Laura and the rabbi challenged me personally in several ways that were refreshing. They had good insight into thinking that would challenge anyone who wants to, as Dr. Laura states, ""do the right thing."" It's not always easy, but following the moral will of God is what He intends if we hope to have a complete and fulfilling life. I think it's pretty clear that, despite theological differences that people from different religions might have, we can pretty much see here how morals come from a source outside ourselves (conscience) or society. It could have only come from God Himself. Without these standards, anything goes. I believe the position advocated by Dr. Laura and the rabbi makes much more sense than anything the atheist or secular humanist has to offer. It's an easy-to-read book and is worth the time and effort to pick it up.";1

With around 30 books in the series it can get pretty expensive =p;1

130413;"One of the leading men who is well into the apostasy of falsifying and corrupting the truth of Christianity is a man named John Shelby Spong.  Christians who will stand faithful to the Lord through His Son Jesus Christ need to know about him and people like him because even if you do not ever read one of his books, you will come across people who have been blinded by his corrupted and degraded Christian beliefs.  John Shelby Spong has several books out there today.  Some of the titles are as follow: Here I Stand:  My Struggle for a Christianity Integrity, Love, and Equality, A New Christianity for a New World, Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism.  These are just a few, there are many more.  What is ironic is that while he has tried, in his own words, to bring integrity, love, and equality back to Christianity, he really has destroyed the foundations and fundamental truths that are found within the holy Scriptures.  Even more so, by destroying the very skeleton of the Bible and Christian reality, he has distorted so many Christians who now follow him that they truly are in a limbo of his leading and making.  I will discuss several of what he calls his Twelve Theses now with the truth of the Bible and information outside of the Bible.From his Twelve Theses, here are explanations for you so that you will know how in turn to be able to get through the muck that has brought down the integrity of Christianity and has placed it into the view of just another ""feel good without truly thinking"" point of views.  To be able to fulfill what is called the Great Commission, you will need and be able to meet in mental and spiritual combat those like Spong who wish to distort anything and everything that is Holy and True about our Lord God and Savior Jesus Christ.  The Twelve Theses is Spongs attempt to be like a New Age Episcopal (no big surprise that he was a bishop within this denomination) Martin Luther.  You can find a full copy of this distortion in his biography, Here I Stand.Creation/Evolution: Spong has the following to say (453): ""The biblical story of the perfect and finished creation from which human beings fell into sin is pre-Darwinian mythology and post-Darwinian nonsense.""  The truth of God however is far above Darwin and in fact, the truth of evolution is probably one of the greatest fairy tales of the 19th through 21st century.  There are many holes and straying strands that exist within what is grouped together as evolution.  Not even scientists who believe, or people like Spong, can't get the right idea of what evolution is.  On the other hand, the Bible's view of the truth of creationism contains a lot of evidence to support this view.  There are a multitude of books that are out there published by intelligent and thought provoking creationist scientists.  DNA, biology, and physiology again and again when brought together support the Biblical ideas.  What is so dangerous is that many people, even those who may be reading this book on apologetics, cannot know the truth because the evolutionsists like Spong within the church and people like the fairly popular Stephen Jay Gould outside Christianity seems to be the popular view that is taught as religion in our school systems and now in our churches.  Instead I would suggest to you to read books like How Now Shall I Live? by Charles Colson and Nancy Pearcey, The Long War Against God by Dr. Henry Morris, and The Face by Hank Hanegraaff.  I would have to go into a book in and of itself about the truth of creationism but I think I have made my point countering Spong.  Charles Colson and Nancy Pearcey have this to say about the debate and how it affects who you are in your Christian walk with God (55): The Christian worldview begins with the Creation, with a deliberate act by a personal Being who existed from all eternity.  This personal dimension is crucial for understanding Creation.  Before bringing the world into existence, the Creator made a choice, a decision: He set out a plan, an intelligent design.Virgin Birth: Spong has the following to say (453): ""The virgin birth, understood as literal biology, makes the divinity of Christ, as traditionally understood impossible.""  Biblical foundations of the virgin birth came from the Old Testament prophet Isaiah within two main segments of the book of Isaiah.  These points are found in Isaiah 7:14 and Isaiah 9:6a.  What Spong has to say is another fallacy that has corrupted so many people who have come to the church to find the truth of God. Christianity is founded on the proofs of the Bible.  Spong says that it is biologically impossible yet how can that be for with the God who created the univesre, is something as simple as this so difficult?  For Spong, in his narrow view of God's truth, the answer is a sad yes.  While you and I can't have a physiological evidence placed in our hand, we can respect the reality of how Christ Jesus, to be who He said He is and how prophecy has spoken true about Him, then we must accept the virgin birth.  We cannot pick and choose what we can and cannot believe in the Bible.  The Bible is true, it is supported by much information.  Even more so, we must accept how the prophecies of the virgin birth have brought about the truth of Christ Jesus.  We cannot say the prophets are liars because in the Jewish sense, if a prophet is wrong about one point, then not only is he a false prophet, then he also will die because Jewish laws show that prophets must be 100% true.  The following is found within the wonderful work by Josh McDowell called The New Evidence that Demands a Verdict, he has this to say (295): The evidence strongly suggests that the birth narratives in Matthew and Luke are built on the firsthand testimony of Jesus' own family members, which further support the conclusion that Jesus' conception and birth were indeed the fulfillment of Isaiah's ancient prophecy.  As Matthew wrote: ""Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying: `Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,' which is translated `God with us.'"" (Matthew 1:22, 23).Cross:  Spong has the following to say (453): ""The view of the cross as the sacrifice for the sins of the world is a barbarian idea based on primitive concepts of God that must be dismissed.""  Such a heresy is horrific to believe but there are many, many people out there who not only disbelieve in the crucifixion but not understanding the reasons why there was the crucifixion.  The cross is the foundation of the Bible, yes, and even more, the cross and the crucifixion is the primary truth of God's love and want for our human race to be saved.  Spong does not, along with the others who believe with Spong, understand the truth that is our Lord and Savior's reason for the Cross.  Jesus could have called a thousand, thousand angels to come down to protect Him from the cross but God knew that His Son had to go through the cross in order for you and I to be truly saved from our sins.  We are a sinful race, we are not able to save ourselves, and thus God was the only one who could save us.  The only way to save us was to face what we faced, thus He had to come into this world, into our human history, as Jesus Christ, as the Son, and bear upon His own shoulders not just the salvation of the world but also the judgment the final judgment upon the affront that sin is toward Him.  J. Vernon McGee has this to say about the truth of the cross (144): ""It was a transaction between the Father in heaven and the Son on the cross.  The cross became an altar upon which the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world, was offered.""  Without the cross and the honest reasons behind the cross, that is to save us from our sins, again we cannot truly know and have faith and be in relationship with our Lord God.  It is a shame that yes again, Spong creates a false reality that has subjugated so many who come to Christianity for salvation and safety.Resurrection:  Spong has the following to say (454): ""Resurrection is an action of God, who raised Jesus into the meaning of God.  It therefore cannot be a physical resurrection occurring, inside human history."" Yet again truth that is founded on the reliability of Scripture has escaped Mr. Spong simply because he, yet again, wishes to nitpick what he wants to believe and what he doesn't want to believe based upon a faulty ground of his ""reasoning"" powers.  We must accept the truth within scripture and outside of scripture toward the reliability of the resurrection.  There are several reasons for this.  Archeologists and historians have come together over the ages to show that the Bible's scriptures hold truth in what they say, that they can be honored and they can be relied upon with all intent and purpose in one's walk with Christ.There were hundreds upon hundreds of eye witnesses that saw and had specific contact with the risen Lord and Savior.  If this was not true, then evidence would have outweighed even the most arrogant supporter for Jesus being back alive.  Yet many a times Jesus was seen, encountered, and talked with by not just the disciples such as Matthew and Mark and John and Peter, but also many others who were firm believers in the Lord yet had no real speaking or political power.  Even after His resurrection, there is ample and true historical evidence that there were those who indeed saw Him and witnessed Him in His resurrected body.  Right after the resurrection the disciples saw him, then others outside the circle of main believers.  Remember the Bible read the following from the Book of Acts 1:2-3:...until the day in which He was taken up, after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom He had chosen, to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them during forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.Then in 1st Corinthians 15:5-8, Paul says the following quote:...and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.  Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died.  Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.  Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.As these quotes show, you must understand that the writers of the Gospels specifically speak of instances where they themselves as the disciples had a personal contact with the Lord and Savior who rose back to life.  There was of course the instance where Thomas, later Doubting Thomas, touched Jesus before the eyes of other.  Then there was also the time where in the early morning Jesus ate and broke bread with Peter and John and the others on the beach.  The first Letter to Corinthians, furthermore, shows that several hundred people had witnessed Jesus after the resurrection.  If any of these instances were not true, then there would have been mounting evidence that would have wiped out even the flicker of believers at this time in history.  As the letter of Paul was written in probably a decade or two after the resurrection, if there was no truth behind Jesus' resurrection, Christianity would have been snuffed out like what someone would do to a candle.  Such evidence seems to elapse from Spong and his followers.  History not only supports the fact that Jesus rose from the grave, it even bows down to its truth.This is just some of the truths that counter weigh the false beliefs of Spong and others like him.  To be a Christian, to fully be raptured by the truth and wonder and hope and joy that is our Lord God and Savior, you must realize that the Bible speaks the truth, that its wisdom is not man made wisdom but God made and that its reliability is found on the solid ground that is where our Lord God stands upon.  As Christians, as believers, I hope and pray that this confrontation to Spong's ideas helps you realize what kind of cancer is biting at the heels of our Church.  If you are an unbeliever, I hope and pray that my evidence has helped at least spark a fire of thought and desire to know more within your heart and soul.  I pray as I write this that God opens your eyes and opens your heart to His eternal truth and love and holiness.";1
234365;Overall, Horns was a good read but not as good as Heart Shaped Box. Joe Hill has great imagination and a gift for storytelling. His characters are vivid and interesting. The premise of this book intrigued me. While the horns symbolized Hell, it was the mindset of the characters that illustrated the concept the best.The one thing about this book that confused me was why Ig was bestowed with those strange powers. Perhaps I missed something before I became immersed in the long flashbacks. The flashbacks from Ig and his former friend, Lee Thorneaux, added great depth to the story that wouldn't have been there otherwise. But I felt that the transition between the main story and the flashbacks could have been smoother.I did enjoy how he used his newfound powers to see into the minds of his enemies and exact his revenge. That was cool! There was nothing in the book that I would deem scary. Creepy and suspenseful, yes. But not scary. I also enjoyed the blend of romance and crime fiction in Horns. The ending, however, felt rushed and flat compared to Ig's first encounter with his arch enemy.Despite my qualms, I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys books with a surreal and suspenseful setting. If you've never read any of Joe Hill's books, start with this one and then read Heart Shaped Box.;1
581629;This is one of those books I will never forget, one that I will re-read soon.  I don't like to recommend books, but I have to say this is one of the most chilling things I've read in many years.;1
93828;I enjoyed the book, and I'll probably keep my eye out for more books by this author.  The background was well enough researched that I never was pulled out of the story, the main characters were interesting.  I particularly liked reading a historical novel were the people were not historical characters, but lived about in the middle of what was possible economically in that time.  I also liked the mystery and how Bek went about solving it.;1
172687;I really love Crichton. Unfortunately, this novel is not up to the standard that he has established with his prior works. Many complain about State of Fear being more of a political exposure than a fiction novel. I actually liked State of Fear, but Next really disappointed me. The characters are shallow and the numerous subplots became frustrating. Everything came together in the end, but I found several of the scenes particularly bland. Each indivudual is faced with an ethical, professional or personal dilemma that centers around the world of genetic technology -- biomedical firms, physicians, forensics, cloning, patenting of genes, stem cells, somatic transfer. You name it and it's covered.I didn't really feel like any big message was conveyed. Throughout the entire book, I was waiting for the message to come through. With State of Fear, it was quickly apparent that global warming and the preservation of ecosystems were to be debunked. Enjoying debate and controversy, I was curious and read on. With Next, I kept working through the book (it was painstaking) hoping to get wrapped up in whatever propoganda Crichton had up his sleeve, with hopes of being entertained or blind-sided with a revelation that might intrigue me enough that I might find more books on this subject. Unfortunately, neither happened.For me, it was a soap opera (sex, crime, drugs, divorce, etc.) with all of the characters somehow linked to the world of molecular biology and genetics. Not bashing the book, it just didn't live up to my expectations. Maybe it was just too long. No disrespect to Dr. Crichton either. Many of his works are phenomenal.;1
490671;Although there wasn't a lot of new information in the book that hadn't already been &#34,exposed&#34, on HLN TV, I think it is important for people to understand what a maniacal, scheming and narcissistic person Jodi is and to understand the depth of her depravity in order to form an informed opinion regarding her ultimate sentence.;1
157786;"Short and stark this story reveals the depth of despair and loneliness endured by a Black sharecropper famly in the 19th century South. Most of the human characters are namelss--which serves to emphsize the dehumanization of a race still enlsvaved: to poverty--if not by archaic law. The plot is painfully simple: the plight of the relatively innocent family which knows it can't expect real justice from a white court. The dirt-poor daily existence of these unnamed people is irrevocably changed when the desperate father breaks down and steals--in order to provide meat for his starving family. In the second half of the 19th century Blacks knew better than to expect Justice from the Law, or compassion from most of their white neighbors and townspeople.Now the boy adores the family dog, who is viciously wounded and left for dead by the arresting deputy. The unnamed protagonist is torn between fear for his father in jail and the dog's very survival. Determined to locate his father in some distant prison camp--of whose very name and location he is kept in cruel ignorance--he can only seek his father during harvesting's off-season.The only white adult who sympathizes with him is a kind school teacher who recognizes his thirst for knowledge and bright mind. Will the boy find his Pa on his own? Can a Black kid buck the White system successfully? And will Sounder, the one-man coon dog, who seems to bea ""human animal,"" ever bark again? How much Character can be built by enduring generations of racial bigotry? A serious read about Family unity and the unswerving loyalty of a canine companion.";1
625345;I am hooked on collecting all of these Penguin Clothbound Classics because they are breathtaking.  I was worried about actually sitting down and reading Les Mis but this translation is great and easy to read!  Definitely recommend!;1
17386;I really like to read this book to my little one - he just loves all the sounds it makes and it's a challenge for the adult to get all those sounds out to enhance the story.  I think some of these books are written for the adults to have fun as well and this one is no exception.  My little one has fun trying to make all the sounds with me and it just makes for a very good and memorable time. Don't pass this one by, it's a classic.;1
134106;"This book succeeds at analyzing sociological developments in a way that is entertaining because Steven Levitt, an economist who strays from convention, has a knack for unpeeling layers and layers of assumptions and myth and showing the real causes behind trends. He shows, to name some examples, how our names affect our career paths, how abortion and the crime rate are related, how a man used his cunning to humiliate the Klu Klux Klan rather than rely on conventional methods, how easy it is to identify the role of public school teachers when they help their students cheat on standardized tests, why drug dealing is only lucrative for the dealers at the top of the pyramid, the myth that real estate agents are looking for our best interests.The book, co-authored by Stephen J. Dubner, is  breezy and anecdotal, which is an effective format for presenting a lot of sociological trends without being dry or losing the scintillating reportage in dense prose.The lesson of this book is that we should be leery of trusting society's common assumptions or common wisdom. In other words, the book encourages us to keep our mind alert and break out of the mold in the way we see things. By looking at social trends with a fresh eye, the book succeeds at making economic trends a fun, adventurous endeavor.If I were to criticize the book, it would be that it is too short. It's barely 200 pages and if you take out the blank chapter pages, the charts, the lists, and so on, it's really closer to 150 pages. Because the material is so current and topical, the method of ""freakonomics"" presented here would make a good format for a monthly magazine. My guess is that there will be many sequels.";1
419715;Underwhelmed by this whole thing.  First of all, it doesn't work very well as a stand-alone book -- way too many references are made to things that happened in some other book with some other characters.  It got tedious as I didn't feel it added to this story at all.  Main characters Roxley and Harriet are just not that likable.  Roxley is a gambler and manages to lose pretty much everything but the clothes on his back even though he is responsible for other people and has just ruined his best friend's sister.  That just makes him seem like a foolish, self-centered man with a gambling addiction.  That's not attractive.  Harriet isn't much better, she throws herself quite shamelessly at Roxley over and over again through the book.  Desperation is not romantic, it was sad and I just wanted her to move on to a better man.The flow of this book is interrupted by several LONG flashbacks, so many that I wished the author had just written the darn thing chronologically instead of halting any action she had built up to go back to something that happened 25 years ago.  The mystery, and that is a very loose interpretation, will be figured out by the reader in chapter two.  Unfortunately the author will beat you over the head with it for the rest of the book.  The happily ever after came out nice and tidy but it was too late for me to care.;1
405852;Honestly is there anything better than a former Mossad operative restoring paintings and kicking the proverbial donkey? I say no, there is nothing better. I read this and immediately tried to join the JDL as their first Buddhist. They wouldn't take me. My sideburns weren't curly enough. I will be reading more of these because this one was such a delight.;1
216192;For Scott St Andrew the only way off his home world is to join the military where he can get an education, see the universe and possibly end up as a commissioned officer.  What he doesn't count on is war breaking out between earth and the colonies while he is still in his first year of training.  This forces his superiors to rush the students through a &quot,conditioning&quot, process which turns them into super-soldiers.Unfortunately for Scott the process was bungled while he was going through it and much of this book explores the consequences of mistakes and explores themes of justice and loyalty.  This is an easy to read book and Scott is a likeable character.  Even, if like me, you aren't normally into military books this is still a good quick read that easily carries you through to the end of story.  I'm looking forward to reading book 2 in this series REBELS IN ARMS.;1
382284;"I have to confess that I'm an adult, but still enjoy YA novels (including this one)!  This is definitely near the top of the ones that I have read.  It's extremely entertaining and fast paced.  I think I finished it in about two days.  It's also pretty well written and not annoying like many YA books can be.I also really enjoyed the characters.  I think Beatrice is a compelling lead and loved the development of her friends and the others around her.  I thought the novel was a good mix of relationships, action, intrigue, and great plot moments.  It was definitely a great concept and kept my attention as I was reading.Although I really liked it, it definitely reminded me quite a bit of another popular dystopian trilogy.  Both had sort of a similar feel with ""districts"" or ""factions"" and some the plot was a bit reminiscent.  They are definitely different stories, but you'll see some similarities.  If you loved the other books though, you'll love this series too.";1
236820;"I've been a fan of pop science for years but when it comes right down to it I'm totally a layman. To my layman brethren I offer this warning, Reinventing Gravity is not an easy read. There are no formulas but quite often I found myself zoning out.What the book is about is the authors attempt to resolve some of the great mysteries of cosmology including the apparent expansion of the universe and the possible existence or non-existence of dark matter and dark energy. The author's theory is that some of the constants of the universe including the speed of light and the force of gravity aren't so constant. In particular he presents a hypothesis that the speed of light during the early moments of the universe was much much faster than the current speed in our corner of the universe. With regards to gravity he proposes that the force of gravity actually increases as objects move apart up to a certain point and then begins to diminish. He calls these ideas modified gravity or MOG.Let me get this right out of the way. The author lost me. I don't understand how adjusting the speed of light at the early moments of the universe solves the strange smoothness of the universe or how having gravity increase and then decrease can be anything but an ad hoc solution to observation. If the author offered up an explanation as to why gravity might behave this way I somehow missed it. MOG also gets rid of singularities particularly those that form Black Holes and the singularity that preceded the Big Bang. As to how MOG gets rid of singularities I couldn't say because I couldn't follow. Maybe I'm just dense so if the following sentence makes sense to you, ""the vacuum fluctuations in MOG's varying G and phion fields in the neighborhood of t = 0 generate the scale-invariant primordial power spectrum that is required to explain the WMAP power spectrum data..."" If that sounds perfectly logical and understandable then this is the book for you.When I read pop science books I like to be informed and entertained and in this case I don't think the author managed either. I was slightly amused by his critique of superstring theory in which he stated that, ""one prominent feature of sting theory is the use of the word ""super"" which enhances its attraction for physics students and media alike"" I have to admit that was funny but that was one brief moment in the book. It's possible that Professor Moffat may have discovered the next great revolution in physics but my suspicion is probably not. I guess I would have been swayed more had his theory contained a little more meat on the bone or didn't feel so contrived. Maybe the problem was in the author's delivery but I just didn't feel as if I was reading something revolutionary. Or maybe I was just too dopey to follow.";1
852;I wasn't sure about this book when I chose it but it turned out to be a wonderful read!  I enjoyed reading about the circus secrets (both pleasant and ugly) and the drama in the love story was completely plausible, and the old Jacob was delightful.

Naturally, when I came across it in a used bookstore, I immediately snapped it up.  Although by today's standards it's pretty tame, &quot,Forever Amber&quot, must have been quite shocking back in the forties when it was first published.  But it's not the racy tidbits that will keep you reading--it's the astounding historical details and just plain old good storytelling.  It's got its flaws--Amber's complete wishy-washiness when it came to Bruce being the major one--but this is still an escapist classic.  Enjoy!;1

514437;While I am not now and have never been obese, I could STILL relate so much to the things the author was saying, it was scary. All women want to drop some weight at some point in their lives, even if it's just 5 pounds. No matter the amount of weight you are trying to drop, it is clear that we ALL go through the same struggles and have many of the same issues. Many times throughout this book, I found myself thinking, 'thank GOD I am not the only one who does that!'I really enjoyed Courtney's honesty and I was interested to keep reading her daily progress (or NO progress) through her diet. Her sister's behavior got me so angry...what kind of sister constantly fusses about the fact that her twin is dieting and tries to sabotage it any way she can? I have to wonder if her sister needs some major self-help. I felt bad for Courtney trying to better her life, yet having to deal with a sibling like that.But what REALLY upsets me are some of the other reviews on here...calling Courtney neurotic and saying she's only whining. What??!! It's called honesty. If the book were full of triumphs and passages about how easy it is to diet, then this would not be a real weight-loss diary, now would it? Wouldn't it be a little dull to read all that anyway? I don't know of a single person who dieted and considered it to be a piece of cake (pun intended).Grow up, people. If you can't appreciate honesty, then don't read these types of books, it's that simple.;1
509133;The Missing Girl is written by an excellent, but often overlooked YA author, Norma Fox Mazer. But this was a disappointing novel. The Missing Girl is supposedly a thriller, but gets bogged down by having six different points of view. Each of the five sisters is a narrator and the sixth narrator is the predator who is stalking them. The suspense gets broken up by family and teen drama in the first half of the book and seems incomplete in the second half. Mostly it is the story of a family disintegrating quickly because of a series of financial set backs. Each of the five sisters is reacting to the crisis differently. Five sisters seems unnecessary. They don't really add anything to the events of the rising action and add little to the tone of the story. Even after one of the sisters is kidnapped by the predator, the multiple points of view add little. The only character who seems fully developed is the very creepy stalker. We learn little about the sisters. The Missing Girl could have been so much better.;1

Then I got the fantasy flight card game, and started the HBO series, but that's another story...Anyway, I can imagine if I'd had to wait years and years for A Feast For Crows to come out, and then wait another 8 years (or whatever) for the 5th book to show up, I would have been mortally wounded and frustrated.  However, I'm a late comer to this world, and I just finished the 4th book and the 5th is coming out in a matter of weeks.Ok, this really isn't about me, what I'm trying to say is that a new reader to the series isn't going to hate the 4th book as much as someone who was there from the beginning.  I love just hanging around in Martin's world, and if the machinations of the Dornish (creating yet ANOTHER regent to go to war over!  genius!) and Cersei's cold-war with the Tyrells, and Arya's stay at the House of Black and White, and Brienne's adventures in her search for Sansa, and Littlefinger's fight with the Lords Declarant don't move the story along enough, well heck the 5th book will be out soon!I'm the last person I though would be defending this book, but reading them all at once gives a different perspective than having to wait an increasing number of years between tomes. So if you're new to this as I am, don't be afraid of ""A Feast for Crows"".  It's a pretty darned enjoyable read.Like everyone else, I'm looking forward to all the Tyrion and Dany chapters in the next one!PS: Martin has to be the most patient writer in the history of writing.  If I'd been writing ""Song of Ice and Fire"", I would have had the OTHERS all over the place.  somehow, he has managed to show them only a couple of times (though people invoke them as a curse on almost every page) since we saw one battle Waymar Royce in the first pages of the first novel.  I am amazed by this.";1
3587;Many years ago I saw a few episodes of the mini-series based on The Winds of War, and enjoyed them at the time. I was out of the country, though, and didn't get to see the end. Later, I spotted the print version in a used bookstore but decided against buying it because it was too bulky (898 pages) and too dated. I wanted a quicker read, and something more modern. Then a couple of weeks ago it appeared on Amazon Kindle for $3.99 so I decided to give it a try. Wow! From the start I was mesmerized. Herman Wouk is a master storyteller and this narrative of the years building up to World War II (based on seven years of painstaking research) never wavers or slows down.Narrated in two voices, that of a U.S. Navy captain who survived the war and a German general who was sentenced to life for war crimes, the novel provides startlingly accurate glimpses of Hitler, Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill. It follows the life and times of a career navy man involved in the planning of strategy, as well as the retrospective analysis of a defeated German general. The book accurately captures not only the history of the time but also the day-to-day life in Poland, in Germany, in Russia. We actually feel the panic and desperation of the Jews as they are surrounded in Warsaw, and understand the futility of the allies as they see Hitler's troops move across Europe in an unstoppable juggernaut of conquest, and understand the frustration of the German general staff as Hitler makes catastrophic moves in Russia. Meanwhile in Washington, we sit in on the war plans' meetings with the naval captain and get the inside scoop of why Roosevelt acted as he did and why it took the U.S. so long to get involved.Others have already covered the compelling plot and great characters in this book, so I will not repeat what has been done so well. I will add, however, that this is probably as good a deal as one likely to find on Kindle: a week to ten days of truly enjoyable reading for $3.99. I only regret that I waited this long.;1

580043;"Initially I disliked the book.  The central character is extremely unlikable - unapologetically rude, self-absorbed, deceitful, manipulative, hypocritical, and physically repulsive - in other words, just like all the rest of us only much more so. And since the novel has no discernible central plot (episodic, much like Steinbeck's ""Tortilla Flat"", which I loved), those features combined to put me off, and so I put the book down after 180 pages (something I rarely do). I wanted something to compel me to keep reading, but Toole's novel frustrated me. I chuckled at a few scenes and smiled at more, but in the first half I didn't see this as the ""comic masterpiece"" others have called it. Yet I decided to finish reading for two reasons. First, I came to like several of the side-characters (Darlene, the would-be exotic dancer, Jones, the aggrieved and exploited janitor at the Night of Joy club) and Mrs. Battaglia, good friend of Reilly's long-suffering mother, who are not only interesting in their own right but likeable where Reilly was initially obnoxious. The other reason is that I wanted to see whether there is a vulnerable self-awareness to Reilly or whether he is simply full of himself. I found I wanted him not to be the overbearing, narcissistic mama's boy that he seemed to be in the first third of the book. And as another reviewer has perceptively commented, one goes from disliking him to fearing for him. To my surprise, I found myself liking him. Beneath the self-absorption I found a keen mind, one unwilling to accept the absurdities and hypocrisies of Our Modern America quietly. And in taking his speak-your-mind attitude to the extreme, Ignatius J. Reilly turns out to be quite the American. Loud, manipulative, and self-serving he remains, but he isn't without a sense of justice and self-respect, and in the final scene, he just may be opening his eyes to what the ""minx"" Myrna Minkoff really means to him.";1
433460;When the world has no air left only the rich are able to survive comfortably. Alina, Bea, and Quinn are on a mission to change how the world works and thinks and to make air available once again to the masses.It was an interesting concept but I didn't like having to follow the constant change of perspectives. Also, none of the characters were really that likable. Both Quinn and Bea seemed to be weak for a hero and heroine meant to change an entire way of view of life. Alina just had a mean and condescending attitude most of the time and came off like she could save the whole entire world by herself. With the hope of a good story line I was once again disappointed, most of the plot points were disjointed and from too many different perspectives. Needless to say I felt there was much to be desired in the outcome.;1

602275;I recently read this new translation after reading James Joyce's Ulysses. It is not the tedious book I remember in high school. Perhaps it was my age and immaturity at the time, but I prefer to believe that that previous translation was more difficult to wade through. This translation, however, makes the Odyssey amazingly accessible. Without the barrier of language, one can perceive the beauty of the verse and the complexity of the story. It is easier to see both the heroism and the flaws of the central character, Odysseus. The reunions that occur at the end are truly touching. If you haven't read this in a while, and you weren't impressed the first time through, I highly recommend you try this translation.As an aside, I find it odd that the Cliff's Notes for this epic has a higher rating than the epic itself.;1

240228;"My Thoughts: I really wanted to love this as much as Wicked Lovely but it fell a little short. We are introduced To Leslie who is Aislinn's best friend. Remember Aislinn from Wicked Lovely?Leslie lives with her brother and her father is off doing only God knows what leaving Leslie and her brother to basically fend for themselves. Usually Leslie can float the bills with her job but sometimes it gets hard, especially since her brother doesn't do much besides smoke it up.Leslie wants to get a tattoo, something to mark her independence. Something that will build her confidence and make her feel like she has some control over her own life.Leslie ends up picking out a tattoo linked to the Dark Court and to Irial, the Dark Court's King. She is basically going to be used by him. She also has a thing for Niall (Keenan's ""uncle."") Niall and Leslie are forbidden from each other by Kennan though.I like the world of faeries. Its interesting how they can be around humans and the humans have no idea.Ink Exchange was a lot different than Wicked Lovely. While Wicked Lovely was more interesting in my eyes, learning about the Summer Court. Ink Exchange had a dark feel to it. It dealt with many different addictions and made me feel a bit disorientated. It was still a good book, just darker.I really liked Niall, I might even say I loved him! But there was something mysterious and sexy about Irial too. I found myself rooting for both guys at different times. And the ending, wow. I can't wait to see what he does next or how he's going to handle things.I'm excited to read the next in the series.Overall: Ink Exchange was good, but not quite as great as Wicked Lovely. I'm excited to see where the characters end up.Cover: Such a pretty cover!

289349;"The Green Collar Economy, How One Solution Can Fix Our Two Biggest Problems, by Van Jones, could not be more timely. As our economy (and perhaps the world economy) enters a period called stagflation--meaning, a stagnant economy coupled with inflation--Jones offers a sound solution.Van Jones gets right to the point in the first sentence of the introduction: ""The pain at the gas pump is just the beginning...This weakness can and will send the entire country into a particular kind of a tailspin."" Jones writes that oil can't keep up with the demand and that it is running out. This is a fact--we cannot keep on living as we have, sucking up finite resources as if there is no end.""Clean coal"", (an oxymoron, he explains, and part of a clever marketing campaign,) nuclear power plants, and off shore drilling are not the answer to our problems. We need to invest in sustainable resources--like the sun and moon--for the future of the planet and people.Using corn for fuel was also a huge mistake. I love what he wrote: ""Government-mandated and subsidized ethenal from corn will go down in history as the 'Iraq war' of environmental solution.""The solution to the problem lies within our people. Jones believes we need workers--and lots of them--trained to green our economy. Most of the jobs would be considered blue-collar, and little more than a high school education and some training would be necessary. The new green collar workers have jobs ""preserving and enhancing environmental quality."" Jobs run the gamut of installing solar panels to energy auditors.Yesterday on the radio, I heard a plumber complain that he hasn't had so little work in over 20 years. That he considered a good day when he could work until 1pm. These people are who Jones writes about and are the workers who would most benefit from the new green economy.Let us hope that The Green Collar Economy becomes the reality.Highly recommended.By the author of the award winning book, HARMONIOUS ENVIRONMENT: BEAUTIFY, DETOXIFY & ENERGIZE YOUR LIFE, YOUR HOME & YOUR PLANET.";1
514116;"Once I read the review that said ""what's the big deal?  So many pages and pages about the same thing"".  Well, it's not all the same thing, not in my ""book"", anyway.  I thought I'd add my two sense worth and say, ""yes"", read this book.  Here is my reasoning.  It may be true that we've heard it all before but it's not all the same ""blah blah blah"".  To get the meaning from this book you must approach it with your imagination not just your analytical mind. Experiencing the hurt of being habitually invalidated requires that we go deep down where the shame lies.  Who wants to do that?  Shame, like invalidation, hurts.  Why do people spend years and years in therapy, hearing the same ""blah blah blah""!  Because, hearing it and feeling ""it"" are not the same, hurt hurts.  This book helps with the ""hurt"", the  meaning of the hurt and what to do about it. In addition, it's a lot less expensive than the price of a therapy session. In the end, the book will last longer and you will be able to lend it  to a friend.";1
202707;I came across this book when researching coma victim Karen Ann Quinlan, who was the probable basis for the novel.  I found it totally believable until the second part of the book after she awoke 17 years later.  (The real Karen died after 10 years in a coma.)  It then morphed into an 'end of the world disaster' film.  However, it ended satisfactorily, and I would happily recommend it.  The reason for giving it only 3 stars is because I found the formatting rather careless, with many paragraphs being tacked onto the preceeding one. This was particularly prevalent with dialogue, on several occasions four separate speeches were piled under one paragraph, making it difficult to work out which character was speaking.I have found this to be a fault in many Kindle books. Come on you guys, it's not rocket science.  Read your book after it's been published as well as just before.  If there are errors, unpublish, correct and republish.  Having three books already published on Kindle I think I know what I'm talking about.  Just type in Helen Byrne/O'Connor's Boy if you don't believe me.;1
405300;Same as the first book? Nope..Better than the first book? Hell yah! Through the Ever Night has wowed me to the highest level. I don't even know how to express my thoughts into words! I probably won't do this book any justice as to what it deserves, hehe. But I'll try ,) Another thing, I don't know where to start after all those mashed up emotions and eye-boggling events that happened in the book.Perry is now the Blood Lord of their tribe but things didn't go well as to what is expected. Some of his people mistrust him for his careless and abrupt decisions. Some of them even left his tribe because of it. But Perry has always put others as his first priority than himself. Despite their attitude  towards him, he didn't hesitate to do the right thing for the safety of his tribe.Aria was forced to find the Still Blue. She was dispatched from the Reverie by Hess' commands. Although this mission was beyond her own volition she she can't get rid of her excitement because this is the only way back to Perry. By the time Aria was back to him, the atmosphere that surrounds them both was dark and heavy. All eyes of Perry's people was on her. They don't and won't accept her for what she is, a Dweller. In the end, Aria knew better than to stay and create havoc in the tribe.Things are against Perry and Aria's relationship. His people, her mission and the Aether. All those hindered their feelings towards each other. On the contrary, because of the Aether and it's dreadful effect to everyone a unity between his people and the people living in the reverie was formed.The characters in the book were well-developed compared to the first installment. Aria's character grew stronger every single time. She knew the best way to sort things out and to make things better. Perry on the other side was in a dire situation. But despite the difficulties he still manage to do the right thing. And of course this won't be complete without saying a thing about Roar, wouldn't it? :) Okay, so let me start off by saying how annoyingly good and attractive he is! * insert crazy fangirling face here* He's just (gawd how do I say this?) overly attractive and scorchingly hot? Haha. The part where he saw Liv? Gawd! That was one hell of a moment to see. And why? Oh, why Veronica Rossi? That was so sad :(The story-line captured my attention till the very end. The actions and unexpected events bombarded me with sugary and sweet desserts! Uh, that was too much of a description? Sorry guys, hehe. The emotions were greatly expressed and was intense enough to stir your stomach. ( What's up with me and food today? 0_o)Through the Ever Night is one unforgettable book you don't want to miss! Veronica Rossi has created an in-depth story that will let you stay late up night just to finish and fangirl afterwards. ,)I totally recommend this for all readers out there![...];1

538530;"I'd read several of Georgette Heyer's books before this one.  While I loved the witty dialogue, the rich language, the attention to period detail, and the characterization, there was always something that kept those books at the 4-star level for me.  An enjoyable light read, yes, but not a beloved must-have book.  This was the first of her books to earn the 5-star rating from me.I think it's mainly because I like both of her main characters exceedingly well.  Sir Waldo Hawkridge is known as The Nonesuch, a man without equal, one of the Corinthian set.  But, he is exceedingly down-to-earth, a charitable man who doesn't think more highly of himself than he ought, and with a wonderful sense of humor to boot.  Miss Ancilla Trent is a lady born, but when her family fell on difficult times, she became a teacher in a girls' school and is not ashamed of it, but has accepted her new place in society.  Sir Waldo finds her as the companion to a spoiled rich girl used to turning everyone's head.  But, it is Miss Trent who eventually turns his head.  Both characters were very likeable, and well-developed, and it was a pleasure to see them end up together, with some obstacles along the way.As with Heyer's other books, this has the wit and dialogue and great characterization (including some minor characters).  It also is ""clean.""  Her characters share no more than one or two kisses/embraces (even that not described that much), usually when they have come to be engaged, but the romance is still believable.  And, in my book, it's much more pleasurable to read.  There is a scattering of mild profanities and a very small number of casual uses of the Lord's name in exclamations, but not so much that I have a problem with just skipping over them.Overall, I would recommend this book as one of Georgette Heyer's best, and an excellent starting point for someone interested in trying her books.";1

I have only bought a couple of products, one of them the Veg-O-Matic, and another one that did slicing or dicing.  I was satisfied with both of them.  But for the most part I thought the rest of the stuff I saw advertised was highy over-priced for what it was. After reading ""But Wait""-- I wouldn't dream of buying anything from an infomercial ever again. I have a suspicious mind anyway, and  this book just re-inforces what I already thought--- that the buyers had better beware.  And keep their credit cards in their wallet.";1

It is far too melodramatic, and the protagonist Guy Montag uninteresting and merely a plot device.  The writing is harried and convoluted, and the plot both unbelievable and shoddy.  In many ways, it's a pale imitation of George Orwell's much darker and sinister ""1984.""

Finding perverse pleasure in a situation that avoids existing people but explores many aspects of literary life with chess as an illustration of how people use their minds to visual the nature of problems that reach back to ancient religion to make black hats a symbol for strict social control that gives an author opportunities to drop comic comments on some relationships that really wish supernatural powers were helping to end what is going on instead of sucking up anything Kant would consider a fetish made The Yiddish Policemen's Union worth reading for me.;1
157712;"I am one of the many people whose first encounter with Phantom of the Opera was the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. It was the most inspiring production I have ever seen, and I fell in love with Phantom immediately. At first, I was mainly interested in this original novel because of the play, sort of as ""research"" into the background of the stage production I loved so much. My interst was not in the book itself. In the end, however, I found out that it was a great work of literature by itself, truly worthy of being called a classic, and deserving higher recognition.In the book, much more than in the musical and other adaptions, Erik the Phantom, is someone the reader can, at first, truly loath. His more tender side isn't shown until the very end, making you almost guilty that you ever passed him off as a sadistic murderer. All he ever wanted was to be normal: to have a normal life, a normal home, and a wife, like an ordinary man. Moreover, he could have become a quite a distinguished figure in society for his architectural and musical acheivements, if he were anything close to ""normal"". And yet this would never happen: his face was so deformed that he couldn't be anything other than a social outcast, hiding in the underground labyrinths of the Paris Opera House.When Erik falls in love with a young and beautiful singer, Christine Daae, he is driven mad by the fact that she could never love him because of his face, and resorts to insane methods to make her ""love"" him. Unfortunately for Erik, she already has a lover, the young Raoul de Chagny,who is generally clueless as to the degree of Erik's passion, and his utter, dangerous genius. Much of the story revolves around this bizarre love triangle. Then there is a whole sub-plot involving the (somewhat humorous)dealings of the Opera managers and the Ghost, and the latter's pranks against them and their business.If you read this novel, prepare to be drawn into a whole new and complex world--that of the Paris Opera house. When I read it, I was struck by the vivid descriptions of the building itself--its enormous size and rich architecture. It creates this sort of cut-off-from-the-world feeling. It is partly this feeling that makes the story so appealing.Phantom of the Opera is written in a very matter-of-fact manner, almost like a newspaper article, with 'interviews' and 'narratives'. The author starts the story by stating that ""The Opera Ghost really existed"". By the end, you are left wondering if perhaps this IS a true story, or at least if Gaston Leroux really believed it was. This is another of the book's appealing qualities. Of course, it is also quite well written, exciting (although it would be wrong to call it constant flat-out action)and just...classic. In short, everyone should read Phantom of the Opera before they die...and prepare to be enchanted by the rich plot and unique characters.Just as an aside, I also strongly recommend the 2004 movie(with Emmy Rossum as Christine and Gerard Butler as the Phantom). It is a well filmed, well acted, and really quite heartbreaking representation of the musical. It never fails to make me cry at the end!";1
217781;"I would give Cool Shade no stars if I could.The main character, Maddie, is introduced to us as kind of a loser. Cool Shade begins with her getting fired from her job - for doing something that she knows will get her fired. Because she'd like to leave town and she's just too messed up to put in her two weeks. She is also full of excuses for why she's a loser - rough childhood, depressive personality, etc. When her (equally loser-ish) sister's landlord calls her regarding her sister's abandonment of her apartment and life, she puts her neglected cat and few posessions in the car and drives cross-country to deal with her sister's mess.So Cool Shade starts off as a mystery - a search for Maddie's sister. But then the sister sort of becomes a secondary plotline as Maddie encounters our male protagonist, Eddie - who is an agoraphobic prostitute-loving alcoholic, mind you, but it's okay because he went through something very bad. And he's so handsome that the throbbing in Maddie's loins that overcomes her mental reasoning is LOVE. She then proceeds to do all sorts of completely irrational things and generally behaves like the mentally unbalanced person she is. Which Eddie is somehow charmed by, through his alcoholic stupor - so charmed he practically stops calling the local pimp for hookers.Both these characters are so full of whining about how rough their lives are, and neither is inclined to actually do something about it. ""Poor, poor victims of a cruel, cold world find shelter in a codependent relationship"" is the underlying theme of this book. It was incredibly frustrating and I could not feel any sympathy for either one.And the big mystery reveal at the end - no spoilers - is anticlimactic. So little attention had been devoted to that plotline in comparison with the dysfunctional romance that my reaction was, so?I do not recommend this to romance lovers, mystery lovers, or anyone else.";1

In chapter after chapter, he demonstrates the significance of understanding the factors that comprise our global economy, explains why the investing maxims you memorized back in business school are misguided, and lays out his paradigm, which focuses on understanding volatility and risk.  Along the way, he makes heretical statements like ""buying stocks is a dangerous way to invest.""The solution to investing woes: options.  Augen makes a compelling case for employing different options strategies to achieve satisfactory returns and minimize risk.  Because the market is evolving rapidly, with new investment products coming available every month, the prudent investor does not adhere to a fixed strategy but rather, using Augen's framework, tries to stay abreast of innovative investment vehicles and exogenous market factors.The appendix is an Options Primer, but Augen acknowledges that it is merely an overview, and that ""interested investors are encouraged to pursue more detailed students of option pricing theory.""  If this is your first (or even second or third) exposure to options, you will need to delve into sources that provide a comprehensive discussion if you want to understand Augen's arguments.My only complaint about the book: some of the examples seem overlong, and (in the proof copy) require much page-flipping to follow.  I assume the formatting will have been fixed in the final version, but a book this superb doesn't need filler.  Brevity works.Trading Realities isn't a how-to manual, but an overview of the complexities that all investors should consider.  Identify the underlying forces, manage your risk...and read this book.";1
202119;"I finally got on the bandwagon and read this book, expecting great things. After two hundred pages, I began to wonder when the story would get underway. Things happen, or don't happen, we're not sure, and then switch tracks and other things happen, and so it goes. Certain characters are developed at great length in excruciating detail, and then vanish completely from the rest of the book or pop up briefly for an unnecessary walk-on. Other characters come along fairly late or lurk in the shadows until all of a sudden we're supposed to start caring about them. We get lots of background we don't need, and other fairly big incidents are danced around maddeningly. (Example, not a spoiler: a character has an experience, and we are later told more than once of his/her sad deterioration. Was it because of this experience? What sort of deterioration? Why? How? Too bad we NEVER FIND OUT ANYTHING MORE.) It's like Maguire has only heard about emotions, but never experienced any himself. I care a lot more about the personal story it was trying to tell and the intersection with LFB's work than I do about Byzantine political intrigue, or how Munchkinland needs to diversify its economic base, or about the oppression of Animals (which got old fast). Not surprising that the musical is only ""loosely based"" on the book--there isn't enough plot here to hold together a short cartoon, let along a feature-length play.";1
507174;Evie has always been different from most other people in her world.  She lives on a farm with her parents and her two brothers, and despite her mother's best efforts she refuses to be more feminine.  Her brothers Doug and Parr defend her the best that they can and everyone else in the family ignores her strange dress and actions.  She is set to inherit the family's farm with Doug, allowing Parr to escape to college and to a life without farming.While Doug is away at college, Evie and Parr meet Patsy at a party.  Patsy's father is an important banker in the community and has an incredible amount of power.  Without Patsy's father's knowledge, Evie and Patsy begin spending a lot of time together.  It becomes clear to Parr that Evie and Patsy are gay and have started dating each other.  He is upset because Evie isn't doing as much around the farm anymore, and he worries that she will leave, forcing him to take over in her place.Others in the community, including Patsy's father, are upset about the fact that the girls are lesbians.  Nasty things are said to them and about them, and Patsy's father blames Evie for corrupting his daughter.  Evie, though, has never been happier.  Can her relationship with Patsy survive all of the obstacles in the way?I liked that Evie was so true to herself and didn't care what others had to say about her.  This story lacked much of the angst that stories about gay teenagers often have.  I would have liked to have seen things from Evie's point of view, though, to get a more well rounded idea of what she was really experiencing, rather than just hearing about it from Parr.;1
494765;Those looking for a fast read full of steamy sexual interludes that leave you wrung out will be drawn to Flashes of Me.  A woman still reeling from the loss of her father is drawn to a quiet yet supportive mountain of a man into a relationship that brings both of them a spot of happiness amidst the grief that they're both living with.  They're both feeling alone at the start of the story which has their burgeoning relationship intensifying in the blink of an eye as they both understand what the other's going through.Kat is a seemingly carefree woman not afraid to express her sexuality.  The last five years have been devoted to her father as he slowly deteriorated from cancer.  She still can't accept the loss and many of her actions throughout the story are due to denial.  She's not wanted a relationship for fear of losing someone else, but the strong and sexy Henley looks like a man who will never leave and who will take care of her no matter what.  Kat left me conflicted in that she seemed very child-like at times, overly exuberant, and acted any way she wanted without fear of reprisal.  Her actions were over-the-top but I applaud her embracing of life completely, even if it didn't feel realistic.I loved Henley from the very start!  He's the strong yet silent type and a calming and supportive influence throughout the story.  After the death of his mother he feels an obligation to protect everyone as he couldn't protect his mother and seeing this scarred and bear-like man show so much care and compassion was immensely appealing.  Everyone runs from him, is scared of him, with him being thought of as a Beast.  The Beauty Kat is the only one not scared of him and she does everything she can to make him smile which in turn made me smile.Theirs is a sweet yet intensely sexy relationship.  They might seem like opposites but their being together seemed very right.  Their relationship progressed quickly and was fueled by numerous playfully hot sexual encounters in the workplace and out but there was a surprisingly emotional connection apparent too.  Though Kat's actions in the real world would be unbelievable, here it made for a delightfully steamy fantasy and a few hours of reading enjoyment.  Though the heroine wasn't always my favorite, Henley definitely won me over.  I loved the sexy beast and his rare heart melting smiles and am still dreaming about him.  Here's to the next tempting hero Ms. Sax creates for us and the continuation of this series!;1

3307;"It is a fascinating tale of Robert (Roberto) Jordon and his paisonos, caught up in the Spanish Civil War. The story covers only three days of the war, yet it takes us on Robert Jordon's life voyage. It is conveyed by the brilliant soliloquy, a tug of war of conscience, duty, honor and death itself.  Who among us has not had such dialogue?It has everything, romance, camaraderie, bravery, cowardice, and above all sacrifice. Jordon, an American, who is addressed as ""Ingles"" by his comrades, is the band's leader, who is commissioned by the rebellion general to blow up a bridge.His team includes some unforgettable characters ever penned, the ruthless yet pragmatic Pablo, his incredibly humane wife, Pilar, Augustine, brave soldier, like a brother to Robert, and lovely, innocent Maria. Roberto (Jordon) and Maria fall in love the moment they meet and once Pilar reads his palm, the denouement is never in doubt.The scene where Pablo is in charge with a gun hustling out town's fascists who are holed up in the church,  to be ""taken care"" of  by the avenging mob outside  is reminiscent of ""krystalnacht"" enactment superbly portrayed by G&uuml,nter Grass in his classic Nazi drama"" Tin Drum"".An all time classic";1

292084;"It appears that our Founding Fathers are big money making schemes. George Washington, father of our country, appears to be the king of money makers of all. From telling fantastical tales about his life, to spreading rumors to where he slept, you wonder if it is at all possible to get to the historical person. Edward Lengel's fantastic new book attempts to peel away the mythological layers of the man in his delightful new read, ""Inventing George Washingto: America's Found, in Myth and Memory.""Turns out, much of what we think we know about George Washington is actually untrue. Lengel addresses each of the myths behind the first president in a gentle tone, respecting the knowledge that people think they know while blasting away the persistent barnacles that latch themselves onto Washington's legacy.Throughout his book, Lengel claims how challenging it can be to know the actual president. Due to unscrupulous people trying to make money off Washington's papers, his written legacy (papers, letters, documents) has been thoroughly trashed through the years. Parson Weems made up countless stories of George (the most famous being the cherry tree story) which has evolved into fact in many people's minds. However, throughout the book, I saw a little bit of the actual Washington peeking through, and that, in itself, was interesting.  Perhaps Lengel, after all, succeeded somewhat in bringing us a slice of the real man.No doubt that people will continue to alter George Washington to fit their cause or beliefs, if only to make a buck. ""Inventing George Washington"" is an important book that allows us to glimpse, however small, to see the man and not the myth.";1

This is, in a sense, Arthur Miller's take on tragedy for a common man--a tragic flaw. Is there a ""growth of character""? The ending may hint at that.

Now I love fantasy novels, and there's an extra level of appreciation as an adult with the Narnia series, since you have a better understanding of C.S.

154998;This book meets the criteria of the film noir movies of the 40's and 50's: oneiric, strange, erotic, ambivalent, and cruel. Well, not erotic. And unlike the films of those days, the pictures here, and the stories that they tell are true.This is a book composed of pictures made in the days after 9/11. They were taken in black and white, and are somewhat grainy. The photographer, John Botte, a police detective and world-class photographer, was assigned by the police commissioner to document the aftermath at the World Trade Center. He was there, day after day, breathing the dust from the concrete, the insulation, and everything else - getting a lung condition that almost cost him his life.Out of the thousands of photographs he too, he has selected this couple of hundred and created captions that sometimes explain, sometimes just comment on what is being pictured.It is indeed a fitting AFTERMATH to 9/11.;1
255655;"Carl Anderson, the Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, has written a practical, yet spiritual book on living out one's faith in the world today.  Drawing on the teachings of Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, he presents the challenge faced by individual Catholics and the institutional Church in living out the Gospel message in a secular, and often antagonistic world.Drawing on papal teachings, Second Vatican Council documents, and an extensive array of other works, Anderson crafts a compelling invitation to Catholics to live the faith that they profess each Sunday at Mass.  The work focuses on the individual dignity of all human life -- valued for its intrinsic worth, not because of it monetary value or economic utility -- and moves to a holistic exploration of the structures of social justice.  He challenges the reader to move beyond the ""culture of suspicion"" to an appreciation for humanity contained within the individual, family, and society.The author calls for those who respect life to work for that respect in all areas.  For example (and I am paraphrasing), opposition to abortion must be coupled with work to ensure that those elements in society that drive a person to consider abortion as an alternative are no longer present.The book is well written and presents a bold challenge to the indifference of many who call themselves Catholic, yet confine their Christianity to the pew on Sunday morning.  At the same time, it is a universal call to social justice, which can be embraced by anyone who seeks the betterment of society and the most vulnerable of its members.";1
13479;This is the third time I have visited the magical world of J.R.R Tolkien's unique Middle-Earth, and I'm sure it won't be the last time! The Return of the King is the final, and in my opinion the best, book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. With just as much action, adventure, suspense and romance as the first two, the final episode breaks all bounds with not a dull moment in its entirety.The book resumes the story of the remnants of what was the Fellowship of the Ring, now the Grey Company. Each have gone their separate ways, and Frodo and Samwise have journeyed to Mordor to fulfill their dreadful task of destroying the Ring. Peregrin and Gandalf set out for the slowly dying city of Minas Tirith to inform its Steward, Denethor, of the death of his son Boromir, who died protecting Peregrin and Meriadoc. While Gandalf and Pippin ride East, Merry, with the rest of the Fellowship and the host of Rohan, rides to Edoras to consult the lady Eowyn, daughter of the king of Rohan. However, a new path is revealed to Aragorn and the Grey Company: The Paths of the Dead. All paths hold danger for each company, though Frodo's is the gravest. With Sauron's Eye upon him constantly, the Ring weighs heavier on his conscience than ever, slowly working its evil on his heart. Having lost all hope, Frodo succumbs to despair and even Sam's optimism cannot lift the heavy burden from his mind.Following the end of the novel, there are the Appendices, which describe the history of each ancient race and its background. Including some excerpts from Bilbo's Red Book, they are a great help in understanding Middle-Earth as a whole.I could not stop reading this book once I started, and I believe the reader will find it just as addictive. Tolkien combines all of the human weaknesses and strengths into this magnificent story of betrayal, temptation, courage, love, hate and valor. Journey with Frodo and Sam as all of the Races join in the fight that will seal the fate of Middle-Earth and end the Third Age. I guarantee it will be an adventure you will never forget.;1
316327;"The premise, though a bit clunky in places, is original. It's not a perfect story, but somehow the author makes it cohere. I thought the ""rules"" for how things worked in the afterlife were arbitrary, inconsistent, and not altogether logical. For example, Madison is connected to her former life by specific objects, but the rules are changed when she's allowed to see her own demise by concentrating on an abstraction. (I'm trying not to give too much away here.) Also, Gabriel is too perfect--no seventeen-year-old boy is that mature, understanding, compassionate, etc. I got a little bored with the scenes centering on Madison as a child. These flaws would have detracted from the story in the hands of another author, but The Everafter is a good read.";1
209941;Reaper Man is the 2nd Death story (after Mort), 10th novel overall, and one of the strongest so far in the Discworld series.  Pratchett's unique talents are in full force with Death, an amazingly funny, amusing guy.  Reaper Man gets off to a hilarious start with a new set of goofballs, agents of the god Azreal, informing Death that his turn is up.  Apparently no matter the (near god-like) occupation or (multi-millennial) tenure, one can be fired and replaced.  Such news is not simply a downer for Death, oh no, this unhappy event literally signals his death.  For him to die, however, he has to first become alive.  He wanders into a corn field and settles down for a day or few as a helping hand for a widow.  Life, he finds, is more than he'd imagined.  Doesn't take him long to decide that he isn't going to take death lying down.While Death's learning a few of life's lessons, Discworld is suffering the consequences of his retirement.  If a 130 year old wizard--such as the cranky old geezer Windle Poons--kicks off, and Death is not around to move him on, what happens?  Zombiehood, that's what (turns out Windle isn't gonna take not dying lying down either).  Discworld starts to fill up with extra life (or untended death, which is pretty much the same thing), and the results are a hoot.  Some of the later half of Poons' story gets a bit disjointed and silly, but the surrounding cast, from the bumbling wizards to the mildly protesting undead, are well-fleshed out (in spirit, anyway) and laugh-out-loud funny.The parallel story of Death stays focused and always engaging and funny.  And Pratchett goes further with Reaper Man:  the conclusion has real substance, providing serious insights with regard to human life and death.  Reaper Man is very, very good.  Highly recommended.;1

385558;Tara Hudson's debut novel, Hereafter, with its romance and stirring descriptions, will appear to fans of ghost stories.  For you see, Amelia is dead.  And when she helps save Joshua from drowning in the same river where she died, an unbreakable connection is forged.Although Amelia and Joshua's romance is love-at-first-sight, their chemistry is the strongest part of the novel for me.  I loved their scenes together, and the electricity that sizzles between them each time they touch left my heart fluttering.  The best part about Joshua?  He's just a nice, normal guy.  Nothing paranormal.  No jerk tendencies.  Just a boy-next-door good guy.  After reading about one too many jerk bad boys this year, Joshua was refreshing in his normalcy.Amelia and Joshua's chemistry kept me reading, but I wished the plot had more places to go.  The focus seemed to be on Amelia and Joshua's romance, and I wished for more action and conflict as a counter to the lovely romance.While I liked Amelia and Joshua, the characters in Hereafter are a little flat.  They are likeable, but nothing was compelling me to root for them or go all fangirly for them.  It was a sweet story with sweet characters, but it was missing that certain something that makes me crave a sequel and proclaim declarations of undying love for a book.But that silver lettering on the front cover?  Sooo pretty.  Fans of a sweet romance with some paranormal ghost elements will enjoy this debut novel.  Tara Hudson has created a world with lots of potential that she can capitalize on in the sequel due out in 2012.;1

I don't know if this is the publisher or the author that does that, but I'm guessing publisher. So to that, I say, don't mislead us without the actual book in our hands to feel how much is left. An ebook should never end before 95%, In my opinion.;1
399321;I got a copy of this book to review through NetGalley.  This is the final book in the Celestial Blues trilogy by Pettersson.  I have actually been enjoying this series quite a bit more than Pettersson&#8217,s Signs of the Zodiac series.There are spoilers ahead from the first two books in this series.Griffin Shaw has finally learned that his wife, Evie, is still alive and he hopes to track her down and finally solve the mystery of who killed him all those years ago.  Unfortunately his obsession with the past is costing him his newfound love with Kit Craig the Rockabilly reporter.  Grif is determined to solve his murder no matter what the cost.  Then he finds out that the past is tangled indeed and he has to ask Kit for her professional help in solving this mystery.This was a well done conclusion to this series.  There is a lot of investigating, mystery, some paranormal elements, and some organized crime.  Grif of course is an angel of sorts, he was sent back to dwell among humanity to be given the chance to solve his murder.  But there is a time limit on how long he gets.  There are some interesting revelations in this book about Grif&#8217,s fellow angels.However the main portion of the story involves Grif hunting down Evie and solving his murder.  Poor Kit loves Grif and wants him to be happy, so she decides to help him track down his wife no matter the emotional cost to her.I love Kit she is such a sunny character, but this is a rough book for her.  She goes through a lot of depression and self-doubt and is left picking up the pieces.  Of course, Kit is strong in her own way and she continues to pave her own way throughout.  I love Kit's attitude and Rockabilly style.Grif has had a blind spot the whole series for his wife from 50 years ago, Evie&#8230,.he&#8217,s been obsessed with solving his murder and finding out what happened to Evie.  This is the book where he finally starts to take the blinders off and see what&#8217,s right in front of him.  I loved how Grif struggles with resolving issues from his past life versus embracing a new life with Kit.The mystery is a bit convoluted but was well done.  There was a lot of &#8220,she did it&#8221,...&#8221,No, wait...he did it&#8221,...&#8221,No...wait..someone else did it!&#8221, types of twists and turns.  The whole thing got a bit serpentine and, at times, kind of confusing.  There were a couple times I had to stop and read back about who was who in all the organized crime families.  In the end though everything made sense and worked out.  Things are tied up well for the end of this series.  There were some surprising twists and turns.Overall this was a decent conclusion to this series.  The twist and turns in the plot got a bit convoluted at times.  However, I really enjoy the way the book had a nostalgic feel even though it takes place in modern times.  I also really enjoyed Grif and Kit as characters, they are very well done and have excellent chemistry together.  This book was an interesting blend of paranormal, mystery, and crime.  I would recommend to those who like urban fantasy and are up for reading something with a bit of a nostalgic feel to it.;1

107764;I made it to page 216 on this one, which is a sign the writing is not terrible. And the premise looks intriguing on paper: the old gods of Europe, brought over by immigrants, are battling with the new gods of technology (shopping, TV). Unfortunately it is all centred around this ex-con named Shadow, who is employed by one of the  old gods as a bodyguard. Shadow is a flat character to whom things happen, he's got no sense of the sacred, it seems, and he seems hardly fazed as he moves from the world of Mickey D's and Greyhounds to the world of Mickey Ds',  Greyhounds and old gods. And there seems to be a reason for this in that Gaiman's tone is so casual, so whatever, and blah that you feel that gods are just boring, normal folk. Who wants to read about boring folk who hire non-emotional characters to fight a war against what? new gods who behave like thuggish stockbrokers? The book is unimaginative and the writing almost never sparkles, it's just chockfull of  cliches. At one point Shadow's dead wife comes to visit him, and she's obviously a corpse, her breath stinks and her feet leave dirt on the floor. You'd expect that kind of scene to be somewhat emotional, or thrilling, but it left me yawning. It was all downhill from there, to the point where I had to stop. You may wish to continue, but I don't envy you at all.;1

How all  the varities of human life can be stored in a single brain of Mr.Seth.  That wonders me. Till now. I can't escape the thoughts of Lata, Maan,  Kabir, Haresh, Varun , Meehakshi, Kakoli, Mrs Rupa Mehra, Arun, Pran and  all those.  I liked Maan's heart, Lata's sensibilities, Malati's  companionship, Mrs Mehra's responsibilities, Pran's arguments,  Kabir's  Passion, Haresh's practicability,  Amit's poetry,  Firoz's friendship,  Arun's angriness,  Varun's simplicity, Mahesh Kapoor's politics, Saeeda  Bai's Ghazals, Meenakshi's cleverness, Bhaskar's calculations, Priya's  talks, Kedarnath's efforts and in the end Seth's picturisation of the whole  of it.  In the end what wonders me more than anything else is the way it's  composed.  While reading it if someone asks you where in the world are you  ?

456160;The Bride Says No (The Brides of Wishmore #1) by Cathy Maxwell is a 2014  Avon Publication.  I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.BOOK BLURB:Lady Aileen never thought she&#8217,d be in this position&#8212,falling in love with her sister&#8217,s betrothed! Of course, her sister did run away rather than marry him, and he doesn&#8217,t seem to be all that interested in her sister either, but even so, such a match is impossible...isn&#8217,t it?Aileen is certain she must turn away from the man she loves in order to protect her sister&#8217,s reputation. However, he&#8217,s not one to give up without a fight, and now that he&#8217,s met a woman he wants to marry, nothing on earth could convince him to let Aileen go.This book was  a hilarious mix up of duty to marry vs marriage for love.  The absurdity of arranged marriages and all the money and politics that put women up for sale basically is examined up close and it's not pretty.  Aileen is one of those VERY rare ladies that has gone through a divorce.  While her husband was abusive it was her alleged extramarital affair that had the divorce papers signed post- haste. Now, Aileen is back in her homeland of Scotland living a quiet unassuming life... until her younger half sister arrives.Tara was to marry Blake, the bastard son a duke,  but at the last moment she gets cold feet and runs away.  She believes that three years ago she left behind the love of her life ,  a horse trainer named Ruary.  She thinks she can just waltz back into this man's life and pick up where they left off.  However, Ruary is engaged to another woman now.  His feelings temporarily become confused with Tara's blatant pursuit of him.  Meanwhile, Tara and Aileen are stunned when their father and Blake arrive and announce Tara is still engaged to Blake and they will indeed marry.  But,  when Blake and Aileen meet there is a chemistry between them.  Soon, Aileen and Blake are falling in love and Tara is being spurned by Ruary and is now desperate to marry Blake.  That should give you an idea of how mangled this whole thing has become.Tara is  not a character I felt any warmth for and that is what the author intended.  She is all about doing what serves her best interest.  She doesn't want Blake anymore than he wants her, but if she can't have her horse trainer she is set on settling for Blake.  She never stops to consider the feelings of others.  She gets Ruary in trouble with Jane and has him confused as to how he feels about Tara.  She also jerks Blake back and forth more than once and it doesn't matter to her one wit about her sister's feelings toward Blake.  She is selfish, immature, and spoiled and has no idea what she really wants.Saying Aileen is bitter about love and marriage is a massive understatement.  She is sick about her father's arrangement for Tara after her own arranged marriage was such a disaster.  She practically pounds the pulpit in an effort to convince her father, Blake and Tara that arranged marriages and selling women off for money ,  or in Blake's situation,  a chance to legitimize himself and have heirs that would inherit without the &#34,bastard&#34, label he carries now.Blake is pretty much in agreement with Aileen on matters of the heart and he respects her far more than he does Tara.  When he learns of Aileen's troubled marriage and her father's deplorable behavior towards her ,  he begins to see that all the tongue wagging gossips are very wrong about Aileen.  It was never the intention of  Aileen or Blake to fall in love,  but fall in love they did. But, Tara is not finished with Blake.  She may not know her own mind , but she's not leaving Scotland without a wedding ceremony.The steam level is very low  in this one, but there was a reason for that.  The plot would not have worked if things had gone too far between any of the characters caught in the web they were all dragged into.The epilogue will have you howling when you realize that Tara and Aileen's father did not learn his lesson the first two times he tried to arrange marriages for his daughters because he can't manage his own affairs.  It seems he's at it again and book two in this series promises to be just as much fun as this first one.Cathy Maxwell is a seasoned historical romance author and I have enjoyed many of her books,  this one is no exception.  4 stars;1

But when the inspiration struck me to try writing some young reader's novels of my own, I began to gravitate towards those books I'd loved as a child, and I've slowly begun to rediscover them.Julie Andrews-Edwards may be famous as an actress, but she's a wonderful author as well. This book focuses on three children who, one Halloween night, fall in with a slightly eccentric professor who believes in another world ruled by a kind but reclusive creature called a Whangdoodle.

606179;Ray Kurzweil, an inventor of new technologies, discusses how today's rapid advances in computer intelligence will eventually lead to machines that are more intelligent than human beings. He suggests that these machines also will develop human sensitivities, leading to an increased blurring between machines and humans. Drawing on the latest developments in science and technology, Kurzweil presents a fairly compelling argument, though some readers may find the discussions hard to follow since he frequently cites physics, biology and other scientific disciplines. Kurzweil is trying to simplify a complex theoretical and technical subject, so we [...] forgive the occasional repetition of his main arguments, and recommend this fascinating, well-researched and well-reasoned book.;1
191630;I've read tantalizing tidbits about Fleur Pillager in other Erdrich novels and stories, but here I got to meet the real woman, in all her magnificent flawed beauty. I especially enjoyed the storytelling when it came from the old Native Nanapush, one of the narrators who combine to tell the story ofFleur's revenge on a white land speculator. A priggish white spinster is one of the narrators, each of whom is affected by the vengeance motif. A poetic and highly satisfying reading experience.;1
633851;Titius Alone is the last, and admittedly weakest, of Peake*s great Gormenghast trilogy.  In it, the self-exiled young Lord Titus Groan now  confronts the world he desired to see.  Before, the brooding pile of the Castle, a character in its own right, had influenced everyone, everything within it, even the spirited Titus.  Its absence already throws this book out of kilter with the first two, it really is necessary to read the others first to uncerstand this one.  The world Titus enters is still no less macabre, a city of spires and airships (it is never clear just when the era is).  The people, animal lover Muzzlehatch, tragic Black Rose, no less compelling.  Yet the story appears incomplete, there exists rebellion, fights, illness, Titus is bewitchingly betrayed by the girl who once loved him--but all throughout, whatever Titus, and the book, is seeking, still remains elusive.  He had sought to be free of his dark home Gormenghast, yet carries his title nonetheless, a name mocked by nearly everyone he meets.  I have not personally read this edition, but actively seek it, as it contains Peake*s notes and further ideas, that may have fleshed out Titus in adulthood.  The ending of this book is abrupt--all but within site of the Castle, he yet turns and leaves once again--a scene rather disappointing, certainly puzzling.  While it is too much to ask that someone take up a sequel (it is like trying to add on to CS Lewis), this reader yet wonders, *What happened after......*  Not for everyone*s taste, or even for all who enjoyed the depth of the first two, but a thoughtful last look, a final postcard from a twisting, tangled journey.;1
363989;This is not a guide book or a compilation of various walks in Paris, but yet walking within the heart and soul of the city. This author seems to understand what makes this a sensational city. Why expats like himself stay on. He has wonderful stories to tell about places, people and events. It is a history lesson, a visual experience, a culinary experience and book of French etiquette all wrapped into one. I am living vicariously through John Baxter. I feel as though I'm strolling along with him in Paris as he is pointing out the scenes and sights, the history of a certain item or event all from my arm chair. I am so there! There is something magical about visiting Paris and after reading now 2 of his books, I know why I have such an infatuation with this city. As many times as I have visited, there is always more that intrigues me, more that I have to see and taste. Thank You Mr. Baxter!;1
401195;Some books are  a foot wide and a mile thick, while others are a mile wide and an inch thick. This book was an food wide and an inch thick, just mindless drivel in a pretty cover. It really was not ready for publication.  The characters are flat, the murderer in the mystery is not developed throughout the book and shows no development, the love story bland.  There is no wedding in the book, either, which would have saved it, in my opinion, as it would have given us something at the end to read. The only thing I did like about the book is that the main character is not 22, stunning, blond, rich, and well sought after, ya-da ya-da. She's 29. That's about it.;1
621255;"Classics.  You pick them up, start into them, and over and over again you end up saying ""So THAT's where that saying (or that name, or that character, or that idea) came from.  Charles Dickens' David Copperfield is one of those lifetime literary destinations for any serious student of English literature.  At nearly 900 pages (and 1.2 lbs shipping weight, per Amazon) it's going to take a chunk of time even for a speed reader to complete. Why do it?  Bunches of reasons.No one, but no one, creates memorable characters like Dickens.  Be it the infamous and serpentine Uriah Heep, the wonderful Mr. Peggotty (whose family dwells in a boat drawn on shore), little Em'ly, Tommy Traddles (whose hair springs straight up every time he takes off his hat), or the eerily accurate portrayal of the idle nobleman in the character of the charming, rich, heartless James Steerforth, Dickens is unmatched in his ability to populate a novel with unforgettable people.  Ask any English Lit. professor ""Who is the master of the archetype?"", I'd bet that nine out of ten would say Dickens (with one out of ten just being wrong).The most autobiographical of Dickens' novels, David Copperfield is strengthened by Dickens' determination to discuss the social evils of the day.  Child labor, the evils of rigid class distinctions, the lot of women, the creaky and abuse prone educational opportunities (or lack thereof) are part of the fabric of the book.  But unlike the important but sometimes dreary social exposes of writers like Upton Sinclair, a Dickens narrative is always infused by hope, gentility, friendship, and often romance.Two small asides:  Dickens was ahead of his time in several sociological concepts.  In the last decade, sociologists with a focus on family have been saying that an individual's success in life is more often determined by having a few key supportive people in one's life, blood related or not, than whether one lives in a family unit with one's biological mother, father, and sibs.  David Copperfield, an orphan from early on, is a powerful demonstration of the concept.  Secondly, an emerging term, PLP (platonic lifetime partner) refers to people that choose to live in a non-sexual relationship with someone as a lifetime partner.  The PLP may or may not be of the same gender, or gender preference.  David Copperfield's aunt and her PLP, Mr. Dick, are an outstanding example of the concept.David Copperfield moves along at a gentle walk, occasionally breaking into a canter.  The pace may not be suited to the sprint mode that many Americans feel compelled to live in.  Relax a bit, settle into a comfortable spot:  the best of Dickens' novels is well worth the time spent.";1
465433;The minute I see the name &#34,Kadir Nelson&#34, I have to buy the book.  I love his artwork and his books are inevitably wonderful.  This one is no different. The story follows a young bear who is lost as he seeks to find his way home. He receives advice from the other animals he meets along the way, each seeking to help him in their own way.  From the cougar who tells him to &#34,remember how you got here&#34, to the ram who tells him to sing a song, Baby Bear searches for the way home. A beautiful look at the journey that we all take through life searching for a place to call home and those we meet along the way to help guide us there.  A sweet story that can be looked at from many levels of understanding with much that can be discussed and enjoyed. The illustrations are vintage Nelson from the sweet-eyed bear to the grinning salmon and the end pages which depict a night scene giving way to dawn.  I think my favorite illustration though is the one with Baby Bear hugging the tree and thinking of home.;1

The plot has potential. The characters are boring. There's a Yoga sex retreat in the middle of the book that drops like an anvil in water.It seems that the author's premise is a girl can get away with anything if she has nice boobs and a nice face.

246720;"Award winning novelist Manette Ansay (Vinegar Hill, Midnight Champagne, Blue Water) doesn't seeem to shy away from challenges.  She set quite a task for herself in crafting a work of fiction focusing on two complex relationships - one historical and the other contemporary.  While the author assures readers in an Author's Note that this is purely a work of fiction, the inclusion of letters and diary excerpts penned by Clara Schumann, Robert Schumann, and Johannes Brahms tend to create a feeling of historical accuracy.To my knowledge the question of whether or not Clara and Johannes were close friends or lovers is still the subject of discussion.  One can draw his or her own conclusions when reading some of their correspondence included in this story.From Johannes to Clara in 1856: "" I wish I could write you as tenderly as I love you and tell you all the good things that I wish for you.  You are so infinitely dear to me, dearer than I can say.....""From Clara to Johannes in 1858: ""I wish I could find longing as sweet as you do.  It only gives me pain and fills my heart with unspeakable woe.""The other relationship explored takes place over a century later and involves 42-year-old Jeanette Hochmann, a novelist who is working on a book about the bond between Clara and Johannes.  Recently divorced she is wounded, alone save for her young daughter, Heidi.  Through a dating service she meets Hart, a handsome German businessman .  By coincidence his native home is Leipzig, which was also Clara's, and he offers to help Jeanette with her research by translating for her.  Of course, more than translation develops.For this reader the lives of the Schumanns and Brahms proved more intriguing than the connection between Jeanette and Hart.  Nonetheless, the play of a historical pairing with a modern one does result in entertaining reading reminding us that the stories of love truly are timeless.- Gail Cooke";1

346605;If you love paranormal YA books like I do, you have heard of the Evernight series by Claudia Gray. I even own the first book in the series but just have not had a chance to read it. When I got a copy of Balthazar (a spin-off title from the Evernight series) for review, I was a little worried that I would be lost having not read the original series first. I'm thrilled to tell you that my concerns were completely unfounded!Skye Tierney, a former student at Evernight Academy, is having disturbing visions where she sees violent deaths and feels what the people in the vision felt. Skye writes to her friend from Evernight, Lucas, for help and he sends Balthazar to see if he can help Skye with her problem.As Balthazar arrives in Skye's small town in upstate New York, she is being attacked by vampire, one from his past. What should have been a quick visit to help an acquaintance with an issue turns into a full time mission to keep Skye from being killed or worse by an extremely evil tribe of vamps led by Balthazar's maker himself.Portions of the book are told in flashbacks and so you get to see how a 19-year-old Puritan boy became a 400 year-old vampire. I love Balthazar and even though I have not read Evernight, I'm so happy he got his own book. Balty is ridiculously swoon worthy and while he is a teeny bit brooding over his past and what he is, he is not overly emo. I love how he treats Skye and while his reasons for avoiding a romantic relationship with her are valid, it's easy to see how much he cares for her.The relationship between Skye and Balthazar is my favorite aspect of the book. Having known each other before, it's easy and natural for these two to click. It also helps that Skye had a huge crush on Balthazar when they were at Evernight but she never acted on it.Unlike a lot of girls in YA these days, Skye is very smart and capable. Balthazar does end up saving her a few times but that's only because Skye is not always a match for a tribe of evil vampires. I'm happy to say that does hold her own a few times.Balthazar is fast paced, exciting and so romantic. Claudia Gray's writing is solid and I raced through this book. If you have been holding back on reading Balthazar because you have not read the Evernight series, don't. The book works perfectly by itself and has actually made me want to read the original series even more. There is no cliffhanger ending and my heart broke a little bit when I found this is a standalone book. I would love to know what happens next with Skye and Balty.Content: Kissing, implied sex and violence.;1
488113;Okay, I have fanned myself and am ready to write my review&#8230, Holy babymaker I loved this short book ( I express the word short). I really do want to complain that it was too short! I know the story ended within the novella but man I wanted it longer and I wanted more! The whole story kept me completely captivated from the first paragraph. I felt as if the characters were completely realistic. I didn&#8217,t feel as though any of it is pushed but in reality thinking about a retired army. I didn&#8217,t buy and read this book as soon as it came out because I was nervous of being let down. I mean really Ms. McAdams how can you top the Taking Chances or Forgiving lies series? Plus I&#8217,m not much into Novellas especially one the precedes a series I haven&#8217,t read yet. But I digress and now must eat my words. I can&#8217,t explain the warm and fuzzies I got during this story and how much I fell in love with Coen and Reagan. This story leaves no cliffhanger and will leave you feeling happy and peaceful with the ending.Review copy provided for an honest review.;1
445721;This was very similar to the author's first work.  The plot involves a man whose foreign wife is missing and his child's preschool teacher is beaten.  The question is whether he is involve with one or both issues.I found it very slow reading.  I spend a lot of time in Tel Aviv so thought its setting there would make it more interesting, but it involved the city very little.  I felt like I plodded through the book and now, a few days after finishing it, I have actually forgotten exactly how it ended.  I really wanted to like it, but it didn't keep my attention.;1

Right now I am rather allergic to vampire novels as so many are being published and very few worth reading.  Though I am not allergic in any way to Tim Powers and he presents vampires that are very powerful and very scary.  As always Tim Powers can take a myth and make it his own with a behind the scenes supernatural system very unique.  So he adds to the vampire myth in his own way.Like the ""The Stress of Her Regard"" the plot involves getting out of the influence of a vampire and in this case two vampires.  There are lots of plot turns along the way to keep the plot growing and enjoyable in the 500 plus pages. I certainly enjoyed the various characters and there is also more of a Catholic element in this novel.";1

160743;Narrators with a touch of bipolarity give this reader trouble. On one page, they are superior, dismissive, and smug, on the next, they are hysterically dependent, remorseful, and wretched. As a reading experience, such narrators seem like artificial constructs where the voices are inconsistent and never quite come together. For this reason, I had trouble with A FAN'S NOTES, HUNGER, and ASK THE DUST. These books give the feeling the author never quite mastered the material.In AtD, this bipolarity undermines the engine that powers the book--the strange romantic relationship that Fante establishes between Arturo and Camilla. Here, Arturo, the narrator, is infatuated with Camilla. He yearns for her when he is alone. But in her presence, he is cruel and condescending. Basically, this dynamic--he's in love, he's a monster--moves the story forward. But this dynamic constantly raises a question: Why doesn't Camilla just drop this obnoxious oaf? What I'm saying is that, on the level of character, this odd romance is improbable, as well as annoying.The ambivalence in this relationship, however, does make better sense on an abstract level. Here, Arturo is a young writer who comes to LA with dreams of literary success. In this striver's adventure, Fante makes Camilla represent LA and Southern California, both in her beauty and her indominability. When viewed this way, Arturo's battling infatuation with Camilla makes sense, since he is accommodating himself to, well, life in California--something that's beautiful but difficult and that he wants to conquer. Still, this is an element in the book--to be puzzled out by a conscientious reader--that lacks emotional impact.Maybe it's a SPOILER. But I recklessly disclose that the ambitious Arturo does have some success late in AtD. But once this happens, the push and pull of story disappears and Fante has to force an ending. Regrettably, this is melodramatic with the young Fante apparently writing about something--hopheads--that is beyond his experiece. Here, clueless is an apt word.Final Note: In my edition, Charles Bukowski wrote the introduction and it's terrific.;1
224788;Brinkley has demonstrated great ability in his research and writing, in his sympathetic imagination and his judgments.  However the book is almost impossible to read:  too much detail, too many individuals and their stories, too much unavoidable repetition.  There is almost too much information from which to draw any conclusions, except the obvious ones:1. At all levels government failed, but the higher the authority the more monumental the failure.2. New Orleans and the Gulf Coast were a disaster just waiting for Katrina, geographically, demographically, socially, and culturally.3. The rebuilding of the damaged remains should proceed only when and if enough funds are really available for a proper reconstruction which would make another disaster virtually impossible.4. Even without Katrina, this part of the country was rotten to the core and would have collapsed of its own weight eventually.  Katrina hastened that process.  New Orleans is the monumental underside of America:  a third-world tribal African country hidden by Ptomekin-like facades.Probably Prof. Brinkley was too concerned with getting a best-seller out.  I don't resent this -- he deserves the acclaim.  But real history cannot yet be written on this topic.  It will, when written, not be about water and sickness, levees and bridges.  It will be about what is wrong with America in the Age of Bush.;1
15965;Make no mistake when reading this review, I enjoyed the book(except the letters sprinkled throughout which seem to accomplish nothing for the plot and only act as a review of the story so far).  My problem with the book is that it starts out with very little to cause the author to jump into the feminist ranting.  Some of the feminist ranting is even worthwhile but with very little to get you to that point, it seems excessive.  And the feminist talk definitely goes overboard at a few points.So what did I like about this book?  Well I loved the idea.  A daughter suddenly taking to the street with a sign and a mother with no idea why.  Instead of explaining from the beginning it was an entire book of speculation on the wreckage that the mother's life became in the wake of her daughter's actions.The conclusion (don't worry I won't give it away) simply removes any significance the feminist tract could have had.  So in the end it's all for naught.;1
34139;Insurgent has got to me one of the most, if not the mot anticipated YA release this year. I was one of those people jumping up and down waiting for the novel going crazy, doing anything I could to get my Four and Tris fix. So you can imagine my excitement when after driving across country my pre-order copy was sitting on my bed! I instantly dove into reading this novel and I was not disappointed.Insurgent begins exactly where Divergent left off. Tris and Four are on the way to Amity compound to see if they can seek shelter or find an ally following Jeanine's simulation attack by the Dauntless against the Abnegation. Now that is as much information about the story as I'm going to give you. This is one of those books where if I tell you just a little bit it will give something else in the story away and I want all of you to be just as surprised reading the story as I was!Tris throughout the novel struggles with the death of not only her parents but the fact that she had to kill Will during the simulation. Her guilt is very real and you feel it right along with her. Unfortunately it also felt never ending. I found myself getting annoyed at Tris a little bit. I understood why she was feeling what she felt but I wanted to see the strong Tris I had really come to love in Divergent, I wanted her to forgive herself.Four *sigh and starry eyes* Oh Four, while he is mostly called Tobias throughout the novel my mind still calls him Four. I'll admit it I'm smitten with him so it is a little harder for me to scrutinize his character the way I can Tris. In this novel though Tobias did seem a little more distant, although I can totally understand why! (I am trying so hard not to give spoilers right now).The relationship between Four and Tris was one of my favorite parts of the story. It was so real. Not just your easy warm fuzzy romance. It had its ups and downs like any relationship, and both of the characters struggled with secrets. It made me love each of them just a little bit more. All of their times alone were exactly what I had hoped they would be. I hope in the next novel we get a little bit more Four and Tris time but as that has never really been the focus of the books I don't expect a TON of love, just enough to keep my romantic side satiated.The world building in Insurgent also greatly expanded on the foundation that was laid in Divergent. We get to see a little bit more into each faction and I felt like in this novel I got to better know not just Amity and Candor but the Factionless as well. That insight into what happens when someone doesn't have a Faction and the way they have been living was really eye-opening and I can't wait to read more!Insurgent was a great second novel. I really enjoyed seeing all the characters again and the action was non-stop I don't think I took a full breath until I was finished reading. I must admit though I liked Divergent better and the loss of the strong Tris I loved so much in Divergent made me give Insurgent 4 rather then 5 stars. This isn't to say I'm not super excited for the third novel, which is slated for a Fall 2013 release date, I am really really really excited for it! Now to sit back and begin waiting impatiently!;1

442820;I always find Dan Ariely's titles interesting and find myself thinking that if the book can deliver on the promise of the title it will be insightful and helpful. Unfortunately, I have not found that to be the case with the books of his that I have read. I am not a social scientist but I find that the research methods that he describes lack adequate (or applicable) controls for the many variables that are outside of the scope of the research. I have also become very skeptical of much of the pop lit social science that has been crowding shelves and Kindles since Freakonomics. As self-help, this may help, but, if like me, you want to know more about the nuts and bolts of the behavioral science that go into the conclusions and recommendations, you may want to stick to journal articles.;1
366275;As Courtney herself can attest, I have been very eagerly awaiting my chance to read Angelfire. I first saw it on a blog several months ago, and then featured it on my first Books I Want SO Badly I Could Pee post. I applied to every ARC tour that had it, entered every Angelfire giveaway I could find, and scourged the ends of the blogosphere for a copy.  I had fallen in love with a book that I hadn't even read yet.Then, on that fateful day that I downloaded it from Netgalley and put it on my Nook, I could swear I heard a choir of angels in the background. I finally had the book I had been ardently pining after for months. I started reading it immediately...And fell even more in love.When Angelfire started out, I will admit that I actually wasn't that into it. It did take a few chapters until I fell into the groove of the novel, and the world built itself in my mind. And then, I was hooked. I sat there curled up in my bed, Nook in hand, for hours until I finished the book. I read it all in one sitting.Ellie, as a protagonist, was good, although I felt she was unattainable. By that, I mean that there were times that I really couldn't relate to her. That's not necessarily a bad thing, because there were times when I was reading, and I sympathized with her completely. Despite the fact that she has superhuman abilities and is the only person in the world that can wield swords of angelfire, she's just a lost teenage girl who doesn't know who she is.  She has boy trouble, she has school trouble, and she has some major parent trouble with a dad who is verbally abusive. (For the record, I suspect foul play where her dad is concerned. There is definitely something fishy going on with him, and something decidedly not human. But, I digress.)The concept of the reapers and angels, and the cake frosting in between, was something new. I've been reading a lot of paranormal lately, namely where demons and angels are concerned, so this was a cool concept. Especially about Ellie, and her reincarnation cycle. I know there are a lot of things that still have to be revealed about this, so I'm definitely on the lookout for the sequel.An integral part of the novel, and what made it so engrossing, was Will. And not just because he's a nice piece of man, but because of the intensity of his relationship with Ellie. He's been with her for centuries, watching and being powerless to save her life as she dies. He loves her. And he's more than willing to risk everything for her, even his life. He feels guilty that he can never save her, even though she always is reborn. Will is strong and fragile all at once, and reading about him was one of the best parts of this novel.Overall, I loved Angelfire. It had everything I look for in a good novel: dynamic and loveable characters, a rapid-fire plot, and an intricate world that'll pull you in and won't let you go.Plot: 4/5Characters: 4.5/5Uniqueness\Creativity: 4/5Writing: 4/5Cover: 6/5!Overall: 4.5/5;1
123313;Lost Horizon is the perfect book for a slow day.  Just sit outside, with a glass of tea and a fuzzy kitten in your lap.  The novel is a slow moving, delightful story, with fully human characters set in a setting of fantasy.  It's not a big book but it feels longer - because of the slow pace and detailed, colorful, descriptions.Four people are kidnapped and taken to the valley of the Blue Moon, where they are offered, in a way, not just a better life but a chance to help in a larger than life project to help the future of mankind (if mankind has a future).A must for ANY library.;1
492383;Faith Clancy has just opened her new psychiatric office in Santa Fe, a long way from where she originally hailed from. She is starting over with a new life and hopes to put her past behind her.In order to be out among the people she dresses in her best dress and only high heels to attend a local art gallery. There she meets Luke Jericho, a rich rancher with a penchant for the finer things but also with a shattered past.Her first problem...her one and only client is his brother! This begins a spiral of epic proportions as he confesses to be the Santa Fe Saint, a serial killer that wishes only to save one's soul. The question is...is he?------------------------This book sends you on a psychological thrilling journey in which you just do not know what to think about the characters, their own haunted pasts and how they all tie in together. Just as you think you have it all figured out...BAM...another twist!Of course there is the innertwining love story between Faith and Luke that adds to the book and does not detract. Even though there is a sexual encounter and sexual tension sporatic throughout it is not described in such detail that you think you are reading a dime store romance novel. This is a nice plus.This book is so complex but yet so easy of read, I was immersed almost from the first pages. I shuddered under my covers at each page turn and lost a little sleep as well.It is unusual for me to read thriller books but this book is a must read for anyone who loves a good can't put it down book!5 stars!~Naila Moon;1
581177;Well, maybe that's a silly title, but Crankshaw's book has to be compared with A.J.P. Taylor's and the latter was a professor.I'm sure Taylor is better informed, but Crankshaw is the better writer.  Unless you're doing a degree and specializing in the Hapsburg dynasty, I'd read Crankshaw.Ditto for the biographies of Bismarck that both men wrote.  Crankshaw is the more enjoyable read unless you're majoring in German history.I read mostly fiction and poetry, and so am no judge of historical writing, but I think learned professors might consider that the common reader can be put off by too many obscure allusions and too much technical jargon.;1

199058;"I really wanted to like this book, but my God, did I find it boring.  Maybe it was because I didn't have the ""typographical weirdness"" on my kindle version the author describes in the intro, but it seemed like a stereotypical ""most teachers are angels, many students are brilliant but just need to be ""reached"" and are misunderstood and not given a chance, families are too busy to care, administration and support staff don't care at all and are lazy"" type of books.  I think I got about half way, and then quickly returned it when I realized I had no idea why I was continuing to read it.I am honestly surprised that this is the long-lived, mandatory reading that the author describes in a somewhat self-promoting introduction.  It was the first book I returned just because I felt like my time wasn't well spent reading it.On to better things!";1
277775;There are so many reviews on this book, it almost seems I don't need to write one, but I loved it so much, I wanted to write my own review anyway.I am a cat person and I hate car racing, but my sister introduced me to this book, showing me all the consistent high reviews, so I had to check it out. I am so glad I did. It is such an amazing book, when I found myself crying in the first chapter, I knew I was in for a good read!The dog, telling the story, is more of a human then many people I have met, and I love that the author chose to tell a story through his eyes. It is a book that is one I will read over again. After racing through it the first time, wanting to see where life was leading this family, I feel like I should read it again, and savor the wonderful writing by Mr. Stein. Great book, great story, beautiful words.;1

574348;"This book is full of general statements and rules of thumb.  I think beginners may like this style as it will put them in the right direction.  What the book is missing for the more advanced are detailed explanations of WHY.  The author will say (I'm paraphrasing), ""holding to expiry is not a recommended strategy"" but then will say ""but it's doable""... No explanation of why/when is it doable or not doable... In contrast, look at Jeff Augen's books (who wrote the Foreward to this book), Augen shows you quantitative evidence for explanations and methodology to evaluate strategies yourself.  Another example is L.G McMillian's ""Options as a Strategic Investment"".  McMillian walks you through exactly what position you'll be given a certain follow up scenario.  Just my opinion, but the book never seems to leave the introductory chapter and get into the meat of things.";1
56023;For the last decade, in the interests of Family Law Reform, I've advised men and women regarding technicals aspects of paternity testing.  In 1994 I helped to revise the Delaware paternity testing statutes to include DNA analysis.In the course of this work, I've met the like of Pete Morrison -- Edward Deangelo's engaging protagonist -- on many occasions.  Here is the first realistic portrait in contemporary literature of one of the men who are fathers from conscious acts of will and innate affection.These are the step-fathers, foster-fathers, and cuckolded husbands who struggle against the societal notion that biology is ironclad destiny.The law, sociology, psychology, and social barriers depicted in this first novel are despairingly accurate, as I can attest.  The issues and arguments are discomfertingly real.Yet what stands out beyond the strong thematic structure is the people Deangelo makes flesh: a confused but well-intentioned man lost in a world of changing rules, a boy cut adrift from the anchors of his identity, and the woman, who in lesser hands could have been a caricature of venality, who remains a sympathetic figure torn between conflicting loyalties.Travel with Pete Morrison on the winding road toward the boy he would have as his son.  You won't be disappointed.;1
49899;In spite of the title, this is a very useful book that will undoubtedly point you in the right direction if you are trying to crank out your first romance novel.  Julie Beard is a romance novelist and a good reference writer.  Most writers are not able to do both well, since they require different skillsets.  I found the boxed writing tips on almost every page to be annoying, but they are probably a generic part of the Idiot's Guide format.  So it is.;1

523822;"""The Well-Balanced Leader,"" a book by Ron Roberts (a well versed and influential trainer of executives), initially appeared as another self-help book for those of us inspiring to be more effective.  When I saw that it came with an ""assessment,"" I began to regret my purchase.  As a leader and manager for over 25 years, I have done my share of assessments.  Was this a failed investment?First and foremost, the assessment was spot on.  It confirmed some shortcomings I have as a leader (as evidenced by my latest performance review I received).  HMMM. . .maybe Ron knows what he is talking about.Here's the valuable part of the book...the assessment will pinpoint areas in your professional life that needs shoring up or fine tuning.  Each chapter is devoted to a particular section of the assessment.  For example, if the assessment states that you have a problem with ""letting go,"" you can go to Chapter 8 and get great advice, tips, and exercises that will help you feel comfortable letting go and letting others assume control. The advice and tips are in-depth and very executable...you can put them into practice and make an immediate positive impact on your leadership.The beauty of this book is that you could use it as the basis of a training problem for your peers and subordinates.  The assessment is quick but thorough and the layout of the book can allow you to tailor a training plan for each of your people.  This book will definitely become a cornerstone of my own professional training and my employees' self-development.So...is this a self-help book?  Yup.  Is it worth the investment?  Definitely.  Should you buy and read it?  I don't think you can afford not to.Read on...learn...prosper.";1
356292;Its not really that great. I like sex as much as the next person I suppose, and there were a few good tidbits here and there about the actual body, but all this goddess crap... sounds to me like the author sets us up to believe that we wont get what we want out of lives unless we worship the goddess within both literally and figuritively. All because of a sex organ... c'mon ladies, we've spent the last century trying to prove thats not all there is to a woman, don't let this sweet talker make you feel any different. The notion that there is another self post orgasm bordelines on the religious, and I don't think I will be attending the church of vagina saints and the patron goddess soon. It was a weird combination of science, only it was used to futher the idolitry of vaginas.;1

I read them out of sequence having read one earlier childish one and then picking up Betsy's Wedding in the school library because of the awesome cover.  I later read the rest of the Betsy books and this one is definitely the best one.  I think the author changed the level of maturity to match the age of the characters.  I'm definitely a fan of Maud Hart Lovelace in the way that some readers are hardcore fans of the Anne of Green Gables writer (I'm not).;1
586587;This little book (Cantor's dilemma) came to my attention ironically not because of its well celebrated English version, but because of the new Chinese translation, which bore a new name (The prisoner of the Nobel Prize). Anyway, I spent a whole evening enthusiastically (at the beginning) perusing it (the English version), but was left with more or less joy.Many people in Amazon.com have praised this little book presumably without any reservation. I would also first congratulate the author's great effort to write a novel on scientific ethics, and in particular for the psychoanalysis of scientists. However, in terms of literature and science, I would say this book is not worth much attentions.The plot in this novel is too simple. A serious professor had a brilliant idea (which is flawed based on biology, by the way), two worked experiments (probably), and the Nobel prize, but suffered by unverified experiments due to suspicious manipulations of his postdoc. It surprised me that he won the prize within a year. This oversimplified the reality. If the professor didn't publish his experiment details and furthermore the experiments couldn't be replicated in other labs (officially), it is impossible to get the Nobel prize, let alone within a year. It would be better that the professor didn't get the Nobel prize and was constantly suffered from unverified experiments, rumors of data fabrication, and science politics. The deft handling of these crisis is more interesting for future academic seekers.One of the key components in this book is about research ethics. We have heard many rumors about research ethics. This book talked about a similar situation occurred in the Noble Laurel David Baltimore's lab, in which a postdoc was involved some manipulations of data. I like the author's way of presentation: hinted but never gave a definite answer whether the postdoc did something wrong with the experiment or not.In terms of science ethics, I would like recommend people reviewing one of the most horrible studies in modern history: The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment. This study was initiated by the United States Public Health Service, together with the Tuskegee Institute in 1932. The study recruited 399 black men diagnosed with syphilis in Macon County, Alabama to determine the effects of untreated syphilis. The study would last until 1970, way after the discovery of penicillin in 1943, which is the most effective drug to treat syphilis. Unfortunately, these black men, with the highest education at 7th grade, were only treated by aspirin and an iron supplement. It was till mass media caught this horror that halted this experiments. By then, many had died of complications of syphilis.Although the book spent quite some length talking about trust, responsibility, authorship , lab rules, and in particular the peer pressure and jealousy, advisor seeking, tenure system, and gender discrimination, the author barely scratched the surface of publishing process, grant application and management, and other important research activities. It is possible that the author thought his intended readers are most likely undergraduates or beginning graduates. However, beginning graduates are eager to know how these research activities are like so that they can decide whether they want to seek academic jobs or not. Most time advisors are reluctant to talk about these issues with new graduate students.The author also devoted some pages on sex, especially on teacher-student type of sex. I am not sure why he blended sex in this book but it did add some vintages in it. The depicting of female scholars in this novel is too optimistic. That a fresh female chemistry PhD can get an assistant professorship in Harvard, Cal tech, and Wisconsin is amazing, if not shocking.In terms of writing skills, the author seemed to have adopted a film making style. However, sometimes background events cut into flow of story too abruptly. Furthermore, the author lacked the ability to write juicy words when he was describing romantic events. His view of sex and romance was also old fashioned.I think the ending is the worst part of this novel. As we all know, academic people are good at insinuating things. A famous professor will never write a blunt insulting letter to another professor. I guess the author tried to give solutions to all problems left in the novel instead of giving some hints. This reflects his lack of confidence to his readers, which are at least college students ( I doubt a not prepared high school student can understand many concepts discussed in his book).In summary, if you don't know much about scientists, this book will give you a good kick start. If you are a graduate student who talk with your advisors very often, this book may be too simple to you. If you are a seasoned researcher, it is probably wiser to use your time on other amusements.;1
594037;Many years ago, when I was a teenager, I read Singer'sEnemies, A Love Story.  Today, I barely remember the plot or the characters.  What I do recall is the sense of beauty and strength in the writing, how it evoked strong feelings and emotions.  I have meant to go back and re-read that book.  Now after reading The King of the Fields, I definitely will.In this novel, a story about a small tribe in pre-industrial Poland, the Lesniks, and their leader Cybula, Singer manages to evoke a good number of universal human experiences, in particular disturbing thoughts.  For example, Cybula deals with his desire to die rather than confront the problems of daily life, as well as his discomfort with seeing his own daughter nude.  He seeks truth but is constantly confused about what is true or not.  His tribe believes in many gods, but this belief is tested when it encounters a Jew and later a Christian bishop.  Who should he believe?  As far as he can tell, his own gods did not protect him or his tribe from misfortune and the new gods seems to come with their own burden of contradiction, rules and cruelty.  This basic questioning of religious faith - to believe or not, of so what to believe, and if so, how to deal with the contradictions and inconsistencies?  - is something that most people confront and deal with at some point.  Cybula's default is his god of death, who seems to be the final arbiter who gives peace when someone dies.The religious aspect is but one of many different perspectives upon which the novel touches.  There are also the plusses and minuses of industrialization, including the challenges and meaning of giving up a former way of life.  There is also a lot of substance to be found on the meaning of relationships between men and women.  Singer presents this in a very crude and raw form, as they probably were in those pre-modern times, with women being completely subservient to man.  At the same time, Singer shows how this power relationship can be easily inverted given the right circumstances.This is a powerful novel that will resonate with the reader for a long time.  Read it and enjoy the work of this Nobel laureate who has been called a master story teller.;1
496425;Though there are no perfect translations of these two classic Chinese works, this version presents ones that are readable and understandable, and capture the grace of the philosophy.  Useful and readable.;1
426659;Damn. I can't believe this is the last book. I am rather sad about it, but also very impressed with the author's decision not to drag a series on into the 30s.  She obviously made a decision and stuck with it- I won't judge if perhaps we have a spinoff? At least a Grizz book- cause dang I'm rather curious.I would not recommend someone reading this as a standalone- you totally need the background that was covered in the first books.Plus there are some freaking hot shifters that you should not miss. So please do yourself a favor and read from the beginning of the series instead of skipping to the end.I would suggest that those who do not like paranormal romances read this book/series. Although it is set in the modern world, you might not appreciate it as much if you despise a fair bit of &#34,magic&#34, (shifters, immortality, etc.).I might just say that Wulfe was my favorite warrior. Why? Because he had such a good heart and soul- I think that was part of his charm.Anyways, read this book if you have finished the first seven in the series!;1

115959;"Working my way backward through David Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer's Best SF series, I have just finished reading The Year's Best SF 10.  I enjoyed most of these 23 stories although a couple left me wondering what I had missed.  Like the ""next"" book in the series,The Year's Best SF 11, this one enhances the stories with well-written story introductions that contain author bios, pointers to other works, and author web addresses.  Good references along with good reading.My five favorite stories all dealt with a deep love that one character feels for another.  This was not a theme of the overall collection, nor a conscious criterion for choosing my top five.  I only noticed it after selecting them and mentally reviewing the plotline of each.Bradley Denton's ""Sergeant Chip"" describes the bond between an intelligence-enhanced dog and his officer-master.  When the moral fog of war closes in, Sergeant Chip's devotion is as important as his intelligence in making the right choices clear.Terry Bisson's ""Scout's Honor"" introduces us to an anthropologist who loves the subject she studies.  This unfolding passion occurs along with a story of impending change in her life.  It's just a matter of when.Gene Wolf's ""Pulp Cover"" is a love lost tale about a devoted employee who loses the boss's daughter to a smarter, wealthier, more charming and more handsome suitor.  It's understandable that he regards this interloper as an opportunistic monster.  It's less understandable that he is chillingly correct.Sean McMullen's ""The Cascade"" starts off as a one-night stand following a chance meeting between two science enthusiasts in a bar.  It becomes something else.  Love can mean never saying the most important thing.Brenda Cooper's ""Savant Songs"" describes an intimate relationship between a brilliant physicist, her devoted graduate assistant, and a customized artificial intelligence program.  Sometimes growing knowledge of our selves makes relationships harder rather than easier.Janeen Webb's ""Red City"" and Steve Tomasula's ""The Risk-Taking Gene as Expressed by Some Asian Subjects"" didn't work for me.  After I finished each of them, I was left with the feeling of a slow build to an abrupt ending.  Both had main characters who achieved interesting insights.  But nothing that seemed to justify the long trudge through the story.  I'll admit that I just might have missed something in them.  The writing, characterization and other elements seemed skillfully done--these are obviously talented authors.  The stories just didn't come together.  Your mileage may vary.And yes, I read this book on my iPhone Kindle app.  It was no less fun than reading other story collections while sardined into a DC metro car or grinning mindlessly through the seventh speaker in some unmemorable government meeting.  The iPhone was good cover, the stories were sanity-preserving medication.  No complaints.";1

342563;As others have written, this novel goes back and forth between a teenage girl [Molly] &#34,with  attitude&#34, and an elderly woman [Vivian] who rode the &#34,orphan train&#34, from New York to the Midwest in the 1920's.  While the historical telling  of this unusual saga in American history had the potential to be fascinating, this book does not rise to that level.  It is full of stereotypes and a simplistic recounting of the trials and tribulations of Vivian from the time she's loaded onto the train as a young basically abandoned child through the war years. She lands in some pretty awful families, there's the abusive family including a lecherous sicko father, a cruel adoptive &#34,mother&#34, who makes her sleep on a palette in a hallway. Then there's the kind teacher who rescues her.  As for Molly, she's not either believable or likeable - really, she steals &#34,Jane Eyre&#34, from the library? And, of course, she's got the evil adoptive &#34,mother&#34,.  I never &#34,got' any true connection between Molly and Vivian other than the obvious, both orphans of sorts.  And the ending wraps everything up too much in a neat little bow.Two other things bothered me about this book: Vivian is only nine [and a deprived nine-year-old at that] and yet she observes things in a very mature manner, observing architectural details, for example.  The other thing is the author's seeming obligation to make Molly's world coarse via the usual ugly language, lots of s-words and f-words.  Kind of seemed forced to seem &#34,present day&#34, and only highlights how low our culture has sunk.  But was it really necessary?Characters are stereotypes and not developed thoughtfully.  And finally, I found the writing more on the level of a Young Adult novel as others have also noted.An irritating book.  And a lost opportunity to really get into the historical nature of this peculiar bit of our past.;1
159600;Fans of historical romance will watch and wait for the next Julianne MacLean release, as each of her books are a delight to read. Surrender to a Scoundrel is no different. The usual research, story and character development is there like her other novels. This story takes place during the time of the famous Cowes Week and yacht races so popular during this period of history. It opens with young Evelyn Foster and her friend Penelope dressing up as young boys and sneaking into a boys dormitory in order to not only see what it looks like, but to sneak a peak of the handsome Lord Martin Langdon, who Penelope has a crush on. They catch the rogue in his usual pursuit, in bed with a young maiden. The straight-laced Evelyn Foster is completely turned off by this scoundrel, even though as a younger man he was a hero and saved her from drowning. The story then moves ahead years later to Crowes Week. Evelyn is attending the event as the sought after young, rich widow Evelyn Wheaton. Lord Martin Langdon arrives with his fast yacht, expecting to win the race and the heart of the most sought after lady of the event, only to find out that there is stiff competition for the race and that this year's sought after lady is a straight-laced, hard-to-get widow and just happens to be the Evelyn Foster from his youth. He is immediately enchanted by the older Evelyn, no longer plain, but beautiful and intelligent, as well as extremely wealthy. Evelyn is not so enchanted, as she remembers the rogue she knew years ago, and the scoundrel appears to not have changed by the stories of his exploits throughout the years since they last met. Martin's seduction eventually wears Evelyn down and they become passionate lovers. What is enchanting about this story is what Julianne MacLean has a talent to do - write the deep depth of feelings and struggles characters are dealing with to overcome their fears about life in order to realize that all that matters is love and that love overcomes all. She did this so beautifully in Love According to Lily and we see it once again in this story. I am looking forwarding to yet another Julianne MacLean romance.;1

154501;I adored the first four books, tearing through one right after the other. But this book was painful to get through. Like other reviewers have complained, our protagonist, Rachel, has not grown one bit through this series. I could handle her antics in the beginning, looking forward to watching her grow into a more independent, self-empowered witch, but it hasn't happened. And from what I've read, it doesn't happen later either. I'm in the middle of the next book in the series,and while its an improvement over this installment, I don't know if I'm even going to finish it (plot problems). It's disappointing because I really like this world the author has created but can no longer stand Rachel!Most bothersome:1. The sleeping with Ivy thing? Ugh. Do it or don't. No one cares. Take out the 100 or so pages devoted to the Ivy/Rachel sex plot.2. More balance... less repetition. Rachel has the exact same conversation with different characters that are pages and pages long, when a brief summary would be sufficient.3. Rachel remarks several times throughout this series about men being men. 'Oh! what a typical guy' she huffs, but she is constantly ogling other men while being in a relationship. I don't care if she is female-- I wouldn't like it if a male protagonist behaved the way she does. She is a hypocrite.4. The bad guys tell Rachel she is stupid, and every time they do I'm reminded of how idiotic she is.***SPOILER******SPOILER***Don't read further if you haven't finished this book!5.

65713;It's difficult to judge how much of this book represents some degree of historical truth and how much just BS strung together to please both the post-Stalinist Soviet regime and, when that failed, the West.  This woman had a troubled past and was more or less crazy IMHO, and she had no loyalty to her father.  In the end I found the book interesting to read but could not bring myself to believe this was nothing more than soapy fiction.;1

594688;Steinbeck? Oh, right. Steinbeck. THE Steinbeck. I can imagine the man sitting in his study on the eve on his sixth birthday. He opens that letter from his publisher, or maybe James Dean. Whoever. It's the letter same letter he's receiving for the millionth time:::John, East of Eden was... It was... Gosh! I've just got no words, man. But then again, that's you're job. Really though, you've really done it this time, the pinnacle of your literary carrier. You're golden, now just kick back and have a martini, maybe give the kids a call. Anyway you can take it easy and die in peace `cause I happen to know that Governor Schwarzenegger is going to make an awesome speech about you in like, 50 years when he adds you to the California Hall of Fame... ::Yeah maybe he's getting pretty old at this point, but he's a writer. He doesn't like playing bingo. He doesn't want to move to Florida and sit on his ass day, he wants to write, even if he's loosing steam.I think Steinbeck's biggest mistake with this book was simply writing some of the world's most brilliant literary fiction, beforehand and not afterward. He kindof sets himself up for some pretty rigorous criticism.Ethan Hawley, admittedly, is a pretty interesting guy. His wit matched with an offhanded and loving sense of humor keeps his interactions with anyone, and sometimes even anything (the cans of produce at the Marullo grocery store, the surreptitious jury of his own subconscious) upbeat with a jolly sort of humor that adds flavor to his constant moral introspections.The rest of New Barrytown though, I couldn't seem to shake the eerie feeling that I'd landed inside a really well written 1960's sitcom. Even Margie, the town floozy, seemed antiquated, repressed, compelled or bound by the book's own courteous tone. The whole reason I love Steinbeck so much is that he usually gives narrative priority to the modalities of commonplace human life before a book's higher social or political motivation. (in Cannery Row he spends nearly an entire chapter delineating mankind's prehistoric relationship with frog hunting) I felt that here, too often, I was getting `American capitalism breeds immorality' smeared around it my face so much, I couldn't see though to what was actually going on, i.e. a portrait of life and money in a very interesting town.Long story short, it's a good read, but nowhere as good as some of his others. Unless you just have to have it all, I'd recommend first sampling the Grapes or the Mice or the Cans.;1

96679;As noted by all reviews of the book, the word play in _Dialogues of the Dead_ is witty and tremendously fun to read. The book centers around a kind of onion made out of games-- there are layers and layers and layers of words and rules and logical puzzles. Think of it as a kind of homage to Lewis Carroll.This said, I wish the plot had been as strong. I guessed the baddie very early on, and was unhappy with the ending, which felt gimmicky and out of place for a Dalziel and Pascoe book. Not my favorite Hill, although with a little better villain, perhaps it would have been.;1

273389;I didn't know a Birkin bag from a Michael Kors clutch, but my boyfriend collects and sells hangbags/messenger bags, and he recommended the book to give me some insight into his avocation/vocation.  The book started off great and I enjoyed the way he writes.  He's very funny, and very unself-conscious about how his comments and asides might sound to others.  It was interesting to read about someone with the balls to start a completely new life in a strange country, all by himself.  And, how he got into the business of re-selling Hermes bags and scarves was fascinating.  However, at a little over 1/2 way through the book, he seemed to just be giving us a travelogue of various, usually beautiful, cities and the nice hotels he stayed and the nice meals and wines he consumed while wearing very nice clothes.  This got to be monotonous for me, with little interest in such niceties.  I would consider buying another book from him, if he writes or has written another, IF it is on a different subject altogether...I think he's very funny.;1

You really got to know her and understand her need for Liz and then Hawk.Tablets and natural disasters? Sounds familiar. I think that was the best part of this book. The similarities you can pull from to our own modern way of life. The believability here is what makes this story. The only twist on reality is the Pulse.The only thing I wasn't quite sure about was how he went about it. You were like clueless up until the end. Secrets and half-truths left you needing to read more. Which is why I came to like this book. The mystery and suspecting left you with only glimpses of what was going on but in the end it was totally worth it. I cannot wait for the next installment to find out more about this cataclysmic world so close to what could actually happen.Carman definitely delivered with this adventurous, suspenseful tale of great characters and evolving relationships.

379052;I enjoyed this book enough to finish it.  As with all the Christine Feehan books I have read so far - it is overly long.  She takes the sexual tension and physical act and repeats it over and over and over.  I liked the dark and brooding and formula designed Hero. No matter how many of these dark, brooding, sexy men I meet in books, I always seem to fall for them. Not so much enthused about his love.  After a very short period of time, I started wondering about her age, and if perhaps she was a little young to be having sex.  I ended up with this picture in my mind of a big breasted 14 year old with the mind and heart of Mother Teresa and the instincts of a cat in heat. The only &#34,bad&#34, thing she did in the whole book, was run around in her bare feet.  Not an unhappy word left her mouth.What kept me reading was the fact that they waited until page 161 to get physical, which was amazing for this author.  And, there was a real story beyond romance.  A murder mystery that was written well enough to make me want to finish the book to find out who the villain was.;1
485907;I enjoyed this book tremendously. It kept me interested from the first page to the end. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's packed full of typos, words like him when it should've been her, etc. Had to re-read the sentences sometimes to make sure I understood it correctly.

484709;The First Phone Call from Heaven is yet another beautifully told tale from the incomparable Mitch Albom. I have been a reader of his work since reading Tuesdays With Morrie years ago and I love his writing. Mitch Albom works magic with words and always leaves you questioning life and what it means to you or should mean to you.What would you do or think if you received a phone call from a person who has already passed on. Well it happens in the little town of Coldwater near Lake Michigan but only to a chosen few of the townsfolk. Of course people are skeptical but to those it&#8217,s happening to it is a miracle. The phone calls tell of the beauty and peace of heaven and encourages telling others so they too would know what awaits them someday. The big question is whether or not these phone calls are real or a hoax and one man is determined to find out.There are several characters portrayed in the book but my favorite was Sully who is the non believer that these calls are actually coming from heaven. Sully has recently been released from jail and is trying to raise his young son after the death of his wife. Naturally these calls have his boy hopeful that his mama will call. Sully knows it can&#8217,t be possible and he hates seeing his son disappointed and hurting. He knows there has to be some explanation. People don&#8217,t receive phone calls or messages from the dead &#8230, or do they?As usual Mitch Albom&#8217,s novel left me questioning how I would feel about this happening. Of course you would want to say all those things you didn&#8217,t get a chance to and tell your loved one once again that you love them. Ultimately this happening in this small town brought people closer to their beliefs and God once again &#8211, it got them going to church and praying again. That alone makes it all worth while &#8230, hoax or not&#8230,I listened to audio of The First Phone Call from Heaven narrated by Mitch Albom himself and he does a fantastic job with perfect tone and emotion. The First Phone Call from Heaven comes highly recommend as do all of his books. He is one of my favorite authors and this newest book of his just topped my list of favorites for the year!;1
265612;Review:  This story is one that tells 2 stories into one. It slowly unravels the mystery of a group of 5 friends who come together after a terrible accident on Jellicoe Road.It tells a tragic story of love and loss. I loved how strong Taylor was while she was trying to dig into her mother and fathers past. Even Griggs, who is the leader of the Cadet with his drill sergeant attitude, has a compassionate side that he shares with Taylor. That compassion is what helps Taylor as she goes in search to find her mother. Slowly you see how their love grows even at times when you think their relationship is over!At times I felt very confused on which characters story I was reading about. I feel that if I were to read it a second time I would understand in better detail the past of the characters more.Overall I thought that it was a good story. I don't think this would be a book I would buy from the book story though. I would have rather got it from the library or borrowed it from someone. I would still recommend this novel to anyone. It was a good story of friends, family, love, and loss.;1
560666;"Mr. Loshin has produced a hands-on, practical work on data quality improvement and management.  If you need some theory but a nuts and bolts focus with a framework laid out for you, this is the book for you.  You can do a thorough assessment of the quality of your data across several dimensions, and develop a roadmap for making a program of specific improvements.Transactional data is distinguished here from informational data, especially from what quality means.  They differ in nature and in function.  Informational data is often mishandled by trying to apply the same standards and principles as you would for transactional data.  Because transactional data is primary and in full view of your business operations, it can overshadow informational data.  While quality is necessary and vital for transactional data, it is not sufficient for an optimally profitable process.  You may be in a line of business where the race is won on the competitive advantage gotten from complex, accurate and flexible informational data.  Quality flaws here are not always obvious up front.I use this book to:- develop action plans at all levels from assessments to strategy to hard dollar  reporting.- teach myself, my staff and my colleagues (each needing different education)On the technical level, this book is certainly not the last word, but it is detailed enough and thorough enough to get real work done while organizing your research and development efforts to plan an enterprise level program of data quality improvement both transactional and informational.  I have been able to define a stream of benefits at each stage of the program.The vulnerabilities I can address using this book are related to regulatory non-compliance, audit failures for data integrity in reporting and contractual liabilities.  On the other hand, I use the data profiling techniques to improve revenue streams as allowed by contracts and related instruments.  In particular, contracts that provide for incentives (and penalties), premiums, bonuses and performance schedules.  Data profiling, parsing and standardization are the big efforts to achieving profit results especially when you are dealing with heterogeneous data sets, for example transactional portfolios from different customers or partners where you need to establish audit worthy claims to monies due you.  We leave a lot of money on the table that we either overlook or miscalculate or do not claim in accordance with agreed terms and conditions.  All interested parties need to have confidence in the reliability and accuracy of data.Informationally, profit and performance align by themselves to create optimal processes and systems.  Data quality tools are used to engineer that alignment.  Of course, the really nasty side of improving data quality is the organizational.  The graves are full of visionaries, pioneers, prophets or whatever buzz word you like or despise.  Here I mean the doers, and not the happy babble types that float in and out of our rather more difficult working lives.  So Mr. Loshin here has a good list of topics in the organizational area, so that you can see and understand what are the obstacles and any possible paths for progress.  Maturity, readiness, will, governance, policy and leadership are all pre-requisites for making quality improvements that can be measured in hard dollar pay-offs.  He has working templates and descriptions for charting all the components of organizational maturity.. He has all the worksheets and exhibits you will need to determine and to document your assessments and recommendations.  I followed his roadmap without making a big political (confrontational) deal about getting agreement, one player at a time until the executive leadership decided what geniuses they were for coming up with it.I would have been satisfied enough with just the first five chapters, just to get me launched.  But the real meat is in the metrics.  You will see the standard old warhorse of statistical process control.  I have really come to like the granularity of daily performance at the shop floor level because you can find the weak and the broken events as they happen, especially as you start to deploy process changes.  People really respond when you are able to show them within a day of launch if they are still doing x or not yet doing y.  By the way, all the mathematics here are early high school level, so you can expect to roll them out to all your analysts, leads and coordinators with just a little presentation, review and coaching.In highly federated organizations, your first steps will present themselves out of common ground, dependencies and other basic interfaces.  Communities of interest and best practices follow especially if you can establish a single showcase.Mr. Loshin lays out the dimensions of data quality, each requiring a method of measurement.  He says that each line of business can pick these up on a dashboard that can eventually roll up to an enterprise view.  Furthermore, he wants these dimensions to create a hierarchy of categories that lay out according to a pyramidal framework where the broad base is constructed from simple measurements and many rules, upward toward the enterprise view of few rules and complex metrics.  This undertaking is ambitious, far beyond the statistical process control and continuous process improvement of the industrial beginnings.His dimensions are categorized between the intrinsic and the contextual.  Both are problematic.  Contextual dimensions are by definition formed in relation to one another, tested for consistency and coherence.  There is no way of knowing if you have done a complete job at any point in time.  Anyway all these systems and process exist in a dynamic world anyway, so you are never truly done, but you get the point.  But the idea is that if they make relational sense, you are likely on the right track.We are still far from some grand unification theory of business process and data quality.  Indeed, just when you get to the critical detail of this schema, you hit a patch like this:Yet although information policies (such as those governing security or privacy) are a major source of data quality assertions, they imply the need for data governance, which is covered in chapter 7.  - [i.e. the previous chapter]Huh?  If you read it really fast you can pretend that it means something.  But just try to parse it.  In a tough and complicated exposition where you most need clarity, he goes all muddy.  This is no time for guessing, which is precisely what you are left to do.  In a moment of a Godel-like nightmare, Mr. Loshin makes completeness and coherence two of the contextual dimensions.  He does say consistency rather than coherence, but to little comfort.  Talk about asking for trouble, especially under the scrutiny of those who have not yet bought into this program...Yet his failure to attain the elegance of mathematical theory or the rigor of applied science does not invalidate his approach.  Seeing is believing, which is his ultimate aim. The intrinsic dimensions are more straightforward and serve a bit as guideposts in otherwise uncharted territory.  Again it is his tables that provide you with handholds to his framework.  Chances are you will not be able to farm out a lot of this work to your people, especially at the beginning.  You must make the high level customization to your organization, your business context.  Then others can carry it forward into their own work and departments.  A core team of architects, analysts, process mappers, project coordinators, data stewards and report producers will require a material operating expense just to get started, about a six month period, and about eighteen to be really firing on all cylinders.  You will be integrated into the familiar world of budgeting and forecasting, capacity planning, performance measurement, and project/data governance.His treatment of a Data Requirements Analysis Process shows you how to transform the way you manage data and processes.  The BIG however, is that it presumes a level of project and development life cycle management far advanced from what is usually existing in operational business units.A further complication is that informational data by nature is a highly derived and constructed.  Because strategic foresight and organizational cooperation (let alone external cooperation) are rare in our customary approach to work, whether business or government, these derivations and constructions are so much more divergent at their origins.  You can build cooperation into your methodologies and governance in order to make data standards a priority.  The best thing you can start with is a proper assessment of the state of standardization (and data quality, for that matter) and decide on ways to move toward your desired point of arrival.  A common fallacy, stemming from shortsightedness, is to choose highly proprietary solutions, confusing obscurity with innovation and competitive advantage.  When leadership imagines that it is way out ahead of the pack, it is actually only temporarily so, because you often motivate the seemingly disadvantaged to cooperate against the outlier.  Think Beta Max.  By contrast, when contemplating the critical employment of meta data, Mr. Loshin does so via ISO 11179.I cannot resist pointing out that, as he is illustrating the problem of data quality, he gives as an example all the different ways of  representing California.  He includes ""06"" as the number in alphabetical order.  The table he references meanwhile clearly shows California in position five.  I almost think he is doing this on purpose to prove his point in a self-validating example.  That or he just wants to se if I am paying attention.By the way, for those who are old cranks when it comes to grammar, this book may be the ultimate in showing why perfect grammar can be worth millions, just by making data representation and communication clear.  Grammar is especially effective in defeating that old bugaboo - ambiguity.Mr. Loshin covers both remediation (correction and correction, to name two types) as well as future planning and design.  He gives a substantial  discussion of Service Level Agreements.  Finally, I know of no better place to go for help in beginning data profiling and parsing, he gives each a chapter.  He shows how it all comes together in a nice master data management schema.  Thusly, he returns to the top of the pyramid, the Enterprise view, well connected, powerful and clearly represented.  This is the only business book I am likely to wear out before I am done with it.Please vote so if you found this review helpful. Thank you.";1

608928;A brilliant telling of a one-day battle where our UN soldiers in Africa  are pitted against the unspeakably evil factions that rule poverty-stricken  Mogadishu, Somalia.  Author Bowden manages to embrace and hold a multitude  of terrifying moments that ultimately merge and grow into hours of  fighting.  It is the result of a small-scale action that unexpectedly  erupts into violence by the slimmest of margins.  An action that grows to a  full-scale battle that rapidly expands to one of impossible odds against  our tiny forces.The battle's progress is poignantly shaped by the  unwillingness of the American soldiers to fire into the developing threat  areas for fear of hitting women and children.  However, the opposing tribal  soldiers show no qualms at all against using Mogadishu's innocent citizens  as shields and decoys as they attempt to close on the tiny handful of  defenders.  That unwillingness to hurt the innocent, cost the lives of some  of the defenders.  This work, vivid and forceful, is an unrelenting  cliffhanger.In writing this account, Bowden insists on the need for  unflagging accuracy, resulting in a milestone work, --- a cogent and  forceful lesson for all.  It is a close-up zoom into the lives of a people  that are poor, where existence is their only priority.  It is also must  reading for the politicians who insist on solving all world problems by  imposing the American way.But, most of all, it is a stirring and  resounding tribute, a salute to our superb Rangers and supremely skilled  Delta and Seal teams.This is journalism at its very best.;1
611441;Travel narratives are my favorite genre, and Heat-Moon's classic, Blue Highways, certainly belongs on my short list.  I was really looking forward  to River-Horse--another sweep across America, by a perceptive and  thoughtful writer and observer.  The book has been a disappointment, and  though it is worth reading, it is not of the level that I expected from the  author.I think the main weakness of the book is that there is hardly any  human interaction.  The brief encounters the author has with folks along  the route really do make them seem like stock characters rather than  interesting individuals.  The author's wonderful introspection, which  enriched Blue Highways so much, just isn't here.  At one point along the  Ohio River the author has a conversation in a cafe, and rather than  relating that conversation, hints that he is saving it to use in a future  novel.  I felt cheated at that point--here I am, in this book, wanting this  adventure to be rich and illuminating.  What the reader is left with is a  series of historical anecdotes, descriptions of bridges and banks, with  occasional comments from his mate Pilotis, a composite of several people  (again, an interesting idea, but I found myself wondering at any given  section of the trip just who was with WLHM).I really wanted this book  to be good, not another Blue Highways, but good all the same, and it just  fell short.;1

214901;"As Patricia Kennealy-Morrison will tell anyone who listens, she once was briefly wed to Doors frontman Jim Morrison. But she rewrites her own love life in ""Blackmantle,"" a messy and rather dizzying fantasy novel, which is too vengeful and wild to be enjoyable in its own right.Imagine her autobiography ""Strange Days,"" but with a lot more murder.Athyn was born on a battlefield to a dying mystery woman, and was brought back home as a foundling by one of the surviving warriors. Years later, she is cast out of her family's home by her cruel foster brother, and goes on to become a legendary brehon. Then she discovers the shocking truth -- she is actually the hereditary queen of Keltia.During this time, she also falls in love with famed bard Morric Douglass. Eventually the two are married, as Athyn drives out the Firvolgi invaders. But the beautiful junkie Amzalsuna is still obsessed with Morric, and poisons him when he comes to comfort her. Now Athyn goes on a rampage against anyone who wronged Morric -- and then goes into the underworld itself, to challenge the god of death.At first glance, ""Blackmantle"" sounds like a sci-fi version of the Orpheus legend. But it becomes clear after a short time that this is a therapy session put to paper, where Kennealy-Morrison can get revenge on all the people in her life who have ticked her off, then live happily ever after with an idealized, faithful Morrison. It gets a little stomach-turning, in more than one way.It certainly doesn't help that Athyn -- Kennealy-Morrison's glorified alter ego -- is such a nasty person. At one point, she skins and debones several men for trivial slights, she also hunts down and beheads Morric's ex-girlfriend, who is a parodic copy of Morrison's longtime girlfriend Pamela Courson. Not to mention the brutal racism toward the Incomers, whose sole flaw seems to be that they are not Kelts. By the last third of the book, it's hard not to wish that a meteor would crush Athyn.Kennealy-Morrison has an admittedly pretty style, with plenty of description and some truly interesting scene, particularly her vision of the Underworld. It does get a bit exaggerated in its faux-Celtic (faux-Keltic?) atmosphere at times. Unfortunately, it's bogged down by too much talking from Athyn, too much adoration of the plastic Morric, and too much sneering at the absurd parody of Courson.Reality and fantasy collide with a nasty splat in ""Blackmantle."" In the end, it seems merely like a way for Kennealy-Morrison to get back at Courson and the Doors in fiction, as she could not do in life.";1
487424;I absolutely loved, loved, loved, this story. Lisa Desrochers took a somewhat touchy subject and created a story that showed just how much the couple struggled with what had been done and their feelings.  Sprinkle in a relationship with a man of the cloth that could or couldn't be considered inappropriate and it makes for a read that was both a joy and made the reader uncomfortable at the same time.Lexie Bank thought her love life was complicated when her long time boyfriend cheated on her.  But when she sleeps with her step-brother, Trent, the one person who knows all her dark secrets, she gladly jumps on the plane to Rome for her one year studying abroad.  She feels as if she's committed some terrible sin and seeks out advice from the church to right the wrong.  There, Lexie meets Reverend Alessandro Moretti.  Between them, they forge a relationship that once again her crossing a line and re-evaluating her life and just what she wants.Poor Lexie was stuck in a hard spot.  She crossed what she felt was a line with her step-brother when they had hot, scorching sex before she left for Rome.  She agonizes over what they did, how she feels about it and what thinks is the loss of her best friend.  That agonizes leads Lexie to develop a relationship with the reverend she's been tasked to work with:  Alessandro Moretti.  Lexie thinks what they have it safe because he's a man of the cloth, but when she discovers Alessandro's secrets and looks forward to the time they spend together, she starts to realize that maybe she's replacing Trent with another impossible relationship she has to take a step back and figure out what lead her down this path.Rome, in all it's glory, and the relationship with Alessandro did teach Lexie about herself and helped her rebuild her faith.  It helped her understand that sometimes you just have to put it out there and hope the person your sending the message to get it.  It wasn't an easy journey for Lexie and she often times questioned herself, Trent, Alessandro and what it all means, but in the end, she makes the right decision about who and what she wants.There is a line for readers in this book as well.  Some may cringe at the subject matter and turn away from the book, but other will be able to see past the line to a great story of self discovery.  I will credit Tiffany Reisz for introducing me to my line and helping me be a little bit more open minded when it comes to subject matters such as this.  If this were eighteen months ago, I may have shied away from this book and truly missed something fabulous.;1
215610;I could not put this book down!  The story is about this young, motivated Celtic monk that gets selected to go on the journey of a lifetime to Byzantium.  When things don't go the way he planned (as they so often happen in real life) he ends up journeying across much of the known world to not only set things right but also to restore his faith.  The characters, the plot, the setting . . . it was all there!I especially liked the rich, scenic descriptions Lawhead puts forth.  Wherever he takes you, whether it's the deserts of the middle east or the land of the vikings in the north, I never had a problem seeing where he was taking me.From the beginning, this story is based around a mystery that just gets more complex as the plot moves along, and yet I never felt lost.  Lawhead allows you to understand the mystery just as the characters understand it, so none of the discoveries really seem contrived or are complete surprises.  Definitely a book I would recommend to anyone interested in a book of epic proportions!;1
102692;The book was amazing, my saving grace in a pile of failures I bought at the book store.It details the adventures of Clio as she is forced from what could be a fantastic summer working side by side with her art store hottie, Ollie, to going along with her father on another one of his crazy schemes.  This time, Clio and her father's other shipmates, family friend Martin, Clio's father's girlfriend, Julia, Julia's assistant, Aiden, and Julia's daughter, Elsa, will be on a yacht off the coast of Italy doing something that no one will tell her anything about.Clio is, understandably, upset.I found the book to be highly enjoyable and watching Clio try to deal with everything from her already frayed relationship with her father, to HIS relationship with Julia, to the extremely hush-hush reason they're on this modern day Gilligan's Isle waiting to happen, to the barbs exchanged between herself and the arrogant Aiden of Yale and Cambridge, to her friendship with Elsa especially when they both end up crushing on Aiden.  Clio was extremely likeable, very understandable, and I was rooting for her and Aiden from their first interaction.Although the real plot of the story got lost in the character relationships and took awhile to kick in, I still enjoyed it.  I love Maureen Johnson's writing and I think she's an amazing author.  Girl at Sea is a book I would recommend for anyone with some time on their hands and a love for summer novels.;1
192110;Cornwell's Grail Quest series isn't as good as his Sharpe series and it takes a book or two to warm up but in the end it delivers a popcorn-munching read. Thomas of Hookton is an archer whose tiny village is ravished by raiders. His adventures then revolve around seeking revenge, fighting for the English in France and reluctantly seeking the Holy Grail. Book 1 has little to recommend it: Thomas is a confused, passive character, the villains and other characters lack depth, there's little narrative drive and way too many gory and repetitive fights, while the Grail quest seems spurious to a modern secular reader. But by the third book, Thomas has matured, the battles have been fine-tuned, and there's a decent, dastardly scheme that must be thwarted. If you're looking for a Sharpe replacement, this isn't it. But as light historical adventure fare goes, you could do worse.;1
317941;Desire of the Dead was just as amazing as The Body Finder. Violet is just as complusive and lovable as the first book. Jay is really caring and sweet in this book. I also lived that you learned more about her friends. I am really interested in what will happen now that the FBI knows about her and also who is exactly Rafeis The plot was just as intense with tons of romance, suspense, and action that it kept me immersed in this book. I like how the echos were more extreme and much more interesting. I can't wait to see what will come next in the series. Derting wrote another amazing book that I love and I am sure that other fans of The Body Finder will love too. I highly recommend that you read it.;1

145642;"There are a number of different series of short biographies that are curretly being published. For example, there is a series of short presidential biographies published by Times Books. Penguin has issued a number of short biographies and now, Harper Collins has joined in with the Eminent Lives series. Edmund Morris's contribution, ""Beethoven: The Universal Composer"" is one of the best of the many short biographies I have ever read. The author, famous for longer biographies of both Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan (the Reagan biography ""Dutch"" was very controversial) has shown that he is an expert in music and is extraordinarily knowledgable about his subject.I bought this book at an author's signing at a bookstore. Mr. Morris stated that he was approached by the editors of this series to write a biography of a subject of his choosing. Morris proposed Beethoven. The editors were skeptical, thinking there might not be a wide audience for that subject. Mr. Morris, howver, prevailed and I'm glad he did as this is superb contribution to the series. At the booksigning, Mr. Morris spoke and he provided extraordinary insights. It is well known that Beethoven became hard of hearing and, ultimately, stone deaf. Although it is not stated in the book, in speaking, Mr. Morris demonstrated that there are certain instances in Beethoven's music in which he is reproducing the odd sounds he was hearing in his head due to his deafness. For example, the opening strains of the 9th Symphony, according to an expert Morris spoke to, sounds like the ""sounds"" caused by a certain type of deafness.Beethoven was raised by a father who was somewhat abusive. His father forced him to practice his music and physically chastised the young child when he did not perform properly. Beethoven became something of a prodigy, not like Mozart as a composer (althopugh he certaily was a very fine one) but more as a performer. He became famous early on and he was certainly the preeminent composer of his day. He became the great composer he was despite numerous demons. Remarkably, he composed much of his greatest work while stone deaf. He suffered from ill health and Mr, Morris speculates that he may have had a case of typhus which led to his loss of hearing, or, perhaps he suffered from lupus.Beethoven had other demons. At times he was almost psychotic. He was paranoid. He was a tragic failure in his love life and his ""immortal beloved"" letters are heart rending. He never had children and after his brother Caspar died, by way of protracted litigation, he got custody of his nephew Karl. Beethoven consiodered Karl his son, not his nephew, perhaps to the point of being delusional. He did everything he could to prevent Karl from seeing and communicating with his mother. Certainly, taking a child away from his mother is hardly meritorious conduct. Quite frankly, Beethoven was not someone who we would consider to be a ""nice guy."" Nonetheless, despite all that he went through, mentally, emotionally and physically,he produced extrordinary music. How can someone who lived such a miserable life have produced music of such unabond joy such as the 9th Symphony?Morris is very knowledgable about music and, indeed he is an accomplished pianist. In fact, during the book signing I attended, he sat down at the piano to demonstrate sounds that Beethoven produced which were influenced by the sounds he ""heard"" in his deafness. Therefore, Morris is able to explain technical aspects of Beethoven's compositions. He does so in a manner which does not make it overly obtuse to the reader who is not expert in music theory (that would encompass most of us). This short biography (a little less than 250 pages) is packed with insights into the remarkable Beethoven. I highly recommend this book to those who love Beethoven's music and to those who, perhaps would like to become afficionados.";1

443234;"From the first words, I immediately felt Kiri's intelligence and the way she is surrounded by people that inhabit her life  don't really see her.  Her parents are completely disassociated, her brother is drowning in rage, and her best friend isn't really a friend at all.  Kiri has built careful walls around herself since her sister's death, but  once a brick is loosened, everything comes crashing down around her.  The call about her sister and Kiri's desire to know the truth brings what she thinks is freedom but what quickly tuns into a prison of her own pain and obsession.  Kiri's mania starts out slowly and soon grows into every part of her life, which is a transformation that is beautifully written and subtle enough to avoid cliche.Kiri is the quirky friend, the brilliant and odd person who is the center of interest at a party, but a person that you don't really know that much about.  As open as she seems, she is a mystery to many of the people she loves.  For that reason, I think her mental illness hides behind her brilliance.  As a reader, you see that what she believes to be true and what people see are two very different things, but since we only read Kiri's voice, the reader must gather this information from the reactions of those around her.  I thought that was a wonderful way of presenting Kiri's spiral because as she goes deeper into her illness, you really do feel like you are watching someone slowly dive off of a cliff.  It's terrifying and mesmerizing all at once.When Skunk enters the picture, their relationship provides a puzzling distraction for Kiri.  Soon, though, it becomes clear that Skunk is fighting his own very serious battles.  Their love story is flawed and bittersweet, but I am glad it was in the book.  It gave a lot of depth to a story that could have turned into another ""smart girl descends into madness"" tale. Instead, their relationship helped it develop  into a darkly funny and sad book about flawed people dealing with sadness both large and small.  Somewhere between glorifying mental illness and showing it for the complicated and painful journey it is, Wild Awake is gritty look at the idea that everyone struggles in their own way.  It was a book that was both bittersweet and hopeful with characters I won't soon forget.";1
446814;I loved this book! The way it's written...back and forth between the past and present made it a little confusing at first and I had to go back and re-read a little paying close attention to the dates but it was well worth it! The characters were well developed and the suspense level was great. I will immediately by her next book as this was the most enjoyable book I've read lately.;1
395032;Even though I was familiar with the Iliad by the time I was 18, it was still a revelation when I learned that Patroclus and Achilles were lovers and not good friends as many translations would have it. This book manages to flesh out that relationship and even though that kind of endeavor comes perilously close to fan fiction, it never skimps on the details of the characters themselves or their relationship.Patroclus grows up as the son of a king but he is too kindhearted and honest to be respected. His banishment leads him to becoming Achilles' boon companion and they go from warriors to lovers even as Achilles' mother continues to hate him. The heart of the book is an effective love story that like the best of love stories anticipates a world that is moving beyond the couple. Most romances want to take place in a virtual bubble without wars or outside forces pulling them apart. The true love stories capture the moments even as history moves beyond them.What's also great about this book is the way that it preserves the greatness of the characters. Achilles is still Achilles and not some sad soap opera. Even though Patroclus sees his tender side, that doesn't mean that he isn't one of the scariest warriors in classical literature.Definitely recommended.;1
158336;This book was so dog gone cute, I couldn't put it down.  Rachel Hawthorne has done an amazing job with this book.  She did not disapoint.  Once I read this cute little story, I rushed out and picked up her other books and was very pleased with each of them.  Ms. Hawthorne has quickly become one of my favorite writters in the YA genre.;1
143740;I read this book a few weeks ago, and wished it was on my list twenty years ago.  So many things in this treasure of a book struck a cord: Cruising across the west on exhuberant road trips (done that), looking for  &quot,where it's at&quot, (still wondering where it is).  Yes, at times the  fellows seem pathetic and misdirected, but who wants spoon-fed happy  endings?  Dean Moriarty is one of the most amazing characters I have ever  come across- how much of him is fiction?  Was Neal really so bizarre? I  can't remember a book I've read that has jogged so many memories and made  me think more about my place in the US.  Definitely a great American novel,  and also a universal novel for wandering souls everywhere.;1
2753;The best part of this novel is the portion in the present day when the main character is an elderly man.  His flashbacks tell a story of an impetuous and hard-to-sympathize-with attraction to a married woman and his painful experiences working for a circus under a couple of bad guys, including a sadist who abuses animals and people alike.  Throw in a fantasy-like description of an elephant's intelligence and abilities, and you can decide if it's your type of story.I read some of the good reviews to try to figure out what the draw is from this book, and I still don't get it.  It was a chore to read, and the only reason I finished it is because it is so popular I assumed I would finally appreciate something about it.;1

552749;This history book is unusual because the facts delineated are from documented sources of truth.  Before reading it I did not realize that even our disgraceful (to put it mildly) exterminating of Native Americans was caused by the same greedy people who have caused all of humanity's troubles, certainly all our wars, via control of mass media and of politicians.  In this case, bald lies in our newspapers of the latter 19th century.  Very few Americans were themselves so greedy, and most could &#34,look any human being in the eyes&#34,.  The same old story, but what a gift to us from Mr. Brown!;1
440985;First, the caveat.  A jacket blurb by Karin Slaughter at the center of the cover states that &#8220,Lynda LaPlante practically invented the thriller.&#8221,  Be warned: Backlash is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a thriller.Backlash is a police procedural in the Anna Travis series.  It is also (SPOILER alert) very much in the spirit of the prime suspect novels.  The premise is straightforward.  A van is being driven erratically.  When it is stopped and searched, the body of a young woman is found inside.  The driver, a former prize fighter named Henry Oates, admits to murdering her and, simultaneously, admits to killing two other young women.  One of them is a young girl named Rebekka Jordan, whose unsolved case was worked by DCS James Langton some five years earlier.  Langton is recovering from knee surgery and asks Anna Travis to investigate the Jordan case (in tandem with another DCI&#8212,Mike Lewis&#8212,who is investigating the other cases associated with Oates).Thus we have a series of difficult personal interactions.  Lewis and Travis must work together but respect each other&#8217,s turf and each must conjure with Langton, who raves and frets and issues orders.  He cannot stand sitting on the sidelines and intrudes with regularity.Having said that, the story itself is completely linear.  We have one suspect and the investigators take 484 pp. to build their case and deal with a few tweaks at the end.  The story is very complex, but it is not convoluted.  Evidence is assembled, case by case, suspects are interviewed and re-interviewed.  Crime scenes are visited and re-visited.The story is well-told, but it is a very long story and it is a very deliberate story, not a thrilling one.  There is a good bit of texture, a decent sense of place and relatively interesting characters.  I would not describe the story as a &#8216,plod&#8217, but many readers will find it slow.  Lynda LaPlante is an expert writer, so this is a very professional work, but it is not a thriller and at some points it lacks &#8216,steady advance&#8217,.  Save it for a three or four-day winter weekend when you&#8217,re in the house for the duration and want a long read.;1

189501;An eating disorder sufferer myself for 7 years, I was very wary of reading this book, fearing that it would be too triggering during my periods of recovery.  However, I finally recently read it, and while it was indeed very triggering in some aspects, I also found that I could relate to Marya frighteningly well.  I think that many ED sufferers will feel this way upon reading this book.Her descriptions of treatment methods that she had experienced rang particularly true to me.  Her account of hospitalization on an ED unit was amazing.  It seems that we could have almost been hospitalized in the same place.  The timed meals, the patient-staff interactions, the fear of facing the dinner plate...all so familiar and honestly rendered.  Marya's interactions with ED specialists, therapist, and other doctors are also all too familiar...the phrase &quot,you don't look like you have an eating disorder&quot, that sprinkles the book will be familiar to anyone who has approached their &quot,healthy weight&quot, while still struggling.I would recommend this book to other sufferers, but with caution.  There are some very triggering passages, such as those describing Marya's frightening descent to her low weight of 52 lbs.  But if a sufferer is doing well in recovery, this can be an interesting and insightful book on the dangers of what we do to ourselves with these horrible disorders.  This book is also good for family or friends of sufferers.  While Marya's disorder is obviously of a very severe nature, she exhibits many of the same thoughts and behaviors of sufferers at any weight or stage of their disorder.;1

I think both are strange really lolI'm sure you know the story line by now so I'll tell you know that I think, both H/h are written well and shown to have flaws like all of us but Ms Gibson has created likeable characters that we want to have that HEA.Poor Stella never knew her father and now her half sister wants to meet her. She's 5 years older and  never knew about Stella till after their father's death.  Beau has been asked to locate Stella and invite her to Texas to meet her sister. Throw in some strange characters that add the story and the road trip that Stella and Beau -- that's the story!!Enjoy!;1
228484;I read this as part of my mission to read all of the Hugo award winning novels, as this is the book that preceded the winning Paladin of Souls.THE CURSE OF CHALION is a book that starts slowly, like a sore man lowering himself into a bath after a terrible day.  And the book's protagonist has had quite his share of terrible days.  Caz is a tortured, tortured individual, but from his troubles he's gained a sort of wisdom.The slowness of the book's start seems to fit with the character's reawakening to a world where he has to think as more than a slave.  As the pace picks up, we see Caz start to come into his own as a courtier, but for some, waiting for that is not going to be worth it.I kept reading--and ultimately loved--this book because Cazaril, Betriz, Iselle, dy Jironal, and many other characters are incredibly well drawn.  The heroes can become the reader's trusted friends, if you will let them, and the villains have power and machinations worthy of their roles.Lois McMaster Bujold is good at religion, miracles, and court intrigue, and those powers are in full force in the latter half of the novel.  The first half is an experience in getting to know the characters, and is broken by an abrupt and forceful climax.  Just when you think it ought to be over, though, you realize that the heroes have worse enemies than you ever realized.The problem is that this early climactic event has a lot of buildup, and then the author has to reestablish a conflict in the middle of the novel.  While she succeeds, this can seem like the reader is getting jerked around.In the end, though, the heroism and depth of the characters can carry you through these rough edges.;1
169514;The Lacuna is an extremely difficult novel to explain. It covers a lot of territory, and a lot of topics. It's difficult to know where to start. It's a novel about a young man named Harrison Shepherd, a Mexican-American who grows up in Mexico and later lives in North Carolina. From the age of thirteen, when Harrison finds himself mixing plaster and cooking food for Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, up through his thirties, when he is a famous author and suspected Communist, this novel is, as the back of the book states, a coming of age story. But it's much more than that as well.As I've said, this is a tough novel to describe. In high school (about 10 years ago), I read everything Kingsolver had written up to that point, and I can say that this book is very much unlike any of her other novels, both in subject matter and style. But just the same, I loved this novel. Lacunae are voids, pieces that are missing, and it's hard for me to grasp exactly what this means. It's because of this that The Lacuna is a thought-provoking novel, one that had me thinking about it and its characters long after I'd put it down. It's definitely bleak in parts, but Kingsolver's writing is magical, contrasting the warmth of the Mexican climate with the coldness of the United States during the 1950s. There's also, sort of, an anti-American bias in this book, the United States certainly doesn't come across very well.The characters are also amazing and well-drawn, though Shepherd seems to be more of an observer in this novel as opposed to an active participant (much, as he says early on, like viewing the world through a camera lens). But there are other, interesting characters in this book, including the prickly Frida Kahlo, with her morbid sense of humor, and Violet Brown, Shepherd's middle-aged stenographer, with her archaic grammar. I though the newspaper clippings and reviews to be a little bit too much, but I really, really loved the rest of this novel.;1
309016;"Truth is, there is no understanding men. They will also never truly understand women, so we are even. So what to do? If you want to know what the average guy is thinking, see what Steve Harvey has said in this book. He presents an honest, down-to-earth version of the true thoughts and feelings of the men around us.While he is his usual comic self, he does an great job of cutting to the chase and seriously telling us women what we might not have wanted to know...that men are what they are, right or wrong, good or bad. Learn to accept that the man in front of you is going to be who he is and you either need to love him ""as is"" or move on until the right one comes along. He makes an excellent point of not settling for a guy who does not deserve you which is something that is not said enough to young women these days.I gave this book to my 20 year old daughter to read after checking it out myself. I felt confident that Steve Harvey was going to give her a new perspective worthy of what I would pass along to her. We were both able to get an idea about why men do what they do, why they think what they think and how to think a bit like them. There was also a section on How To Win the Game...with a refreshing dose of ""get some standards and make him live up to them"" as opposed to ""do whatever it takes to make a man happy if you want him to love you"".This is a fabulous book for women whether you have a man or are looking for one. Truthful, humorous insight and some of the best advice I have seen in a long time!";1
230122;This 2nd book in the Lady Spies series is infinitely better than the first.  I really liked the characters of Ana and Lucas, Ana, a widow is content to remain faithful to her first love Gerald and her love of cryptography until lady spy Emily is shot and she has to take over for her.  Ana, then meets tempting spymaster Lucas who provokes passion from her.  Ana suspects Lucas' best friend of being responsible for the spy murders, and circumstances lead them to be married to each other which complicates the case and their live.  The clever writing and tension in this novel is absorbing and I definitely know that the connection between Ana and Lucas is passionate which make their somewhat contrived story just read so good.;1
157969;"Message to academic critics: Recognize there is a distinction between a ""translation""--which this is not--and a ""rendering""--which this is. A rendering breathes fresh life into the message. The best way to create a rendering is to take the best contemporary translations, and sense one's own resonance with them, and express this resonance from the heart, to the heart of the reader. Mitchell does this spectacularly. Obviously, the Tao Te Ching is itself a rendering. Certainly this ancient perennial wisdom existed before it was written down, likely far back into pre-history. The wisdom resonated with Lao Tze, and he expressed it in writing. Why would we be so naive to think he originated it? Do we have that little regard for our ancient pre-historic ancestors? There never was and will never be a definitive version of the perennial wisdom. Not Lao Tze, not Moses, not Jesus, not Meister Eckhart, not Socrates, not Buddha, not Shankara, and not Stephen Mitchell, and not any of the ""academically correct"" translations you seem to worship. The true Tao cannot be conveyed in words. Anyway, that's my take on it.";1

554378;"I don't always agree with Mark Kermode's opinions (""The Exorcist"" is the greatest film of all time??!!) but I admire his ability to express himself with passion and intelligence. His reviews are unapologetically personal and biased and his aesthetic wanders all over the place.What I like most about this latest volume is that Kermode puts the blame for the present sorry state of cinema where it most properly belongs: on the average movie goer.As long as a substantial number of us are willing to put up with ""diminished expectations"" and go to films merely for two hours of diversion and entertainment, we will continue to be bombarded with the cinematic offal spewed out by the likes of Michael Bay, Zack Snyder and JJ Abrams. Directors with no respect for the power of film, the legacy of past masters. And truly brilliant talents like Mike Leigh and Ken Loach will struggle to find a mainstream audience for their magnificent offerings.It's a sad state of affairs but at least we have voices like Mark Kermode's out there, insisting that we can do better and demanding that we at least TRY.";1

I never expected to like this book as much as I did but it was amazing!  I appreciated all of the author's anecdotes from her time on Little House, (I have a completely different view of Michael Landon now, not bad, just different!)... but what threw me for a loop was how well she related and has dealt with the horrible abuse that she suffered as a child.  I applaud her for being able to get through that trauma and also actively campaign for protection for other victimized children. I also want to add that much of this book was laugh out loud funny!

631664;Library Lil is a great and funny picture book for kids about a determined young librarian who wants everyone to use and enjoy the library.  It is a tall tale, which is the only truly American folk/traditional tale, in the spirit of Pecos Bill or Paul Bunyan with a female heroine, and it's the ONLY tall tale I know with a girl in the lead.  Lil is a great role model who is able to singlehandedly haul a beat up bookmobile around and tame a wild motorcycle gang, all in the name of producing prolific readers in her small town. This is a great character who gives tribute to the usually under appreciated school librarian. Steven Kellogg's colorful and active illustrations add to the wildness of the story and the savvy of Lil's character.  They allow children to see everything unfold as Lil's story is told.  Lil is an unforgettable gal who delivers a good message about reading and with a surprise twist at the end she leaves them laughing when she goes!  Believe me, when this one is used as a read aloud, the listeners will howl!;1
88584;This is great science fiction, time dilation giving us glimpses of humanity every few hundred years as our race battles against the competing issues of the drive to procreate and the limited resources available to a growing population.In many ways the war just seems like something to throw money at to keep the economy stable.  It's based on a lack of communication.  For both of those reasons it seems to resonate with our current political climate.The Forever War asks many questions.  One of the biggest:  Will there be war as long as there are differences?  And the corollary: Are these differences worth holding on to?  The only real answer that we get is that love still manages to find a place in all the insanity, even when both love and the very concept of individuality border on extinction.;1

It contains a wealth of illustrations and tools that are priceless in terms of teaching process improvement teams basic six sigma methods.

447816;"Set at the base of Hope Mountain on a farm during the onset of the Great Depression, Patricia Harman begins one of the most beautiful novels I have ever read. Harmam describes the landscape in such a way that you feel the seasons change. She draws you in so deep that you forget you are reading a work of fiction.""I've played too many roles in too short a time, had too many names, lived too many places."" -Patience MurphyElizabeth Snyder Gordesky is on the run when her friend and midwife mentor, Ms. Kelly, brings her to West Virginia. Ms. Kelly dies of a broken heart and Elizabeth has a new role to play. Of all the roles Elizabeth has played being the midwife, Patience Murphy, is her most redemptive. Bringing new lives into the world slowly heals her heart of all the loss she has suffered in her past.""To be a midwife was never my goal."" -Patience MurphyWith each baby that Patience brings into the world there is a unique experience and an equally unique family. Times are hard for everyone. Patience's expertise is needed regardless of color, class, or economic status and she gives herself relentlessly. When Patience acquired an apprentice, Bitsy, who was threatened with homelessness a beautiful friendship blossoms. Bitsy being a young black woman brought a new dynamic to Patience's life and work. No matter how the community embraced Patience, she did not feel comfortable revealing who she really was.The communities surrounding Hope River was clearly divided. Whites and Blacks. Patience being from Pittsburgh often crossed the lines. She was determined not to be boxed in. She faced racism head on. It must be said that Harman includes themes such as social justice, domestic violence, labor organizing, women's rights, and violent racism in a novel whose main theme is midwifery in an extraordinary way. Just when you thought the story could not melt your heart anymore Harman moves us by including two women with disabilities whose strength is astonding.There were so many small details of this book that really made me smile. I fell in love with Patience's love and affection for her animals. The dogs Emma and Sasha who were named for radical anarchists. The cow Moonlight with her calf Sunny. Patience nursed a lame horse, Star, back to health. She often delivered babies where her only payment was food or nothing at all. The different reactions to birth by each family will make you laugh and cry.I literally pondered over this review for days because I knew no matter what I wrote it would not express how much I enjoyed reading this book. Over the course of the novel, Patience reflects on her own past little by little. She heals gradually. Throughout Harman gives a balance of life and death. By the end a new life and a new love is blossoming and Patience's past is finally put to rest.The Midwife of Hope River is one of those books I will never forget.*ARC provided by LibraryThing Early Reviewers";1

519121;Jack Morgan was a great guy and when he died, a lot of people mourned him. He could have lived another 20 years, but he died because of an inept, malfunctioning, costly healthcare system. Jack thought this system was protecting him, but it killed him.The hospitals, employers, managed care insurers, the Congress and executive branch, and health policy academics, all conspired, according to Dr. Regina Herzlinger, Harvard Business School Professor and accomplished author, to kill Jack and hundreds of thousands others, and to make enormous profits in the process.Her solution? Consumer-driven healthcare, more or less following the Swiss model. It would enable innovators who have great ideas about how to get more value for the money to enter the space and allow providers compete for Jack's business. It would encourage multiple revolutionary innovations in the supply of health care and result in significantly better and less expensive service.A truly innovative approach for radical improvement that can be accomplished incrementally and tremendously benefit all of us.

648349;"To read Cather is to see life stripped bare of all but the essentials, then to recognize its beauty anew, and finally learn something original and profound. This is certainly the case with Song of the Lark.I won't detail the novel in full. Instead I'll try to offer a few pithy observations.SOTL is epic in scope. The first ""act"" taking place in Moonstone is so well developed it is a complete story unto itself. As a result, I am glad I read the book tabula rasa. This allowed me read unencumbered by expectations of plot development and to find each new turn in the novel a surprise.This novel speaks to anyone who has ever wondered if they must reject their home and leave a life behind in order to achieve greatness. This theme is echoed often in modern literature. The Fountainhead by Rand may seem like a strange comparison but in fact, the concept of giving everything to art is fundamental to both author's works, however divergent their style and tone may be.Regarding the style, I don't seem to recall as much noteworthy prose as Cather's other novels. That said there certainly is much to admire here. I vividly recall the final pages (spoiler ahead) with Thea's theater exit and a friend left among the waiting throng of admirer's. This scene combined with the narration, evokes the loneliness and separation Thea's pursuit of art has created.I am surprised to find this novel among my favorite Cather books. After reading My Antonia, this novel provides greater diversion from the homogenous world of the prairie. As wonderful as the aforementioned novel is, it's nice to see Cather explore other places with her eye towards the simple, unrefined beauty that is found everywhere.";1

302604;THE LONGEST TRIP HOME is a heartwarming and highly readable boy-next-door memoir about growing up Catholic in 1960s-70s suburban Detroit. It's also about growing independent from family and away from faith, and, decades later, coming back to face parental health declines.Simply written and straightforward in structure, the book's appeal is its universality -- that every ordinary life is filled with interesting and meaningful moments. That said, Grogan briefly loses sight of the reader near the end and segues into more of a Grogan family history than a memoir for public consumption. Still, his story is fun and touching and relatable in so many ways that I recommended this book to my siblings and cousins.;1

636784;"As a reader I like to have quick reference books at my finger tips including a new version of the Oxford English Dictionary about 3500 pages long - that I use almost daily. So I decided to add a ""history atlas"". In the process of doing my research I read the other amazon.com reviewers and then made three trips to two large book stores to actually look at the books and get a better feel for which was the best. I ended up buying the Oxford Atlas of World History. Here are my picks and rankings.Listed by My ranking, #1 is the best, #2 is a creative alternative but no substitute.1. Atlas of World History, Oxford University Press 2002, 368 pages, $57.80, 13.5"" x 10.3"" x 1.62"" ranked 46,632 on Amazon.com. Hands down winner - professional - good text descriptions, outstanding maps and drawings, covers most things from the cave man forward. Negatives: Big and heavy. If you want to save a few dollars buy the ""concise"" version.2. Creative alternative: The Penguin Atlas of World History, Penguin Books 2004, $11.20, just a paperback sized, just published, 304 pages. Surprisingly impressive, lots of text and pictures mixed together and it is easy to carry around. A nice quick alternative but it will be printed in two volumes.3. Timelines of World History, DK Publishing 2002, 666 pages, $27.20. 10.0"" x 1.6"" ranked 25,800 on Amazon.com. Second with lots of value but in some ways not as comprehensive.4. National Geographic Almanac of World History, National Geographic 2003, 384 pages, $28.00, 9.6"" x 7.8"" x 1.17"" ranked 24,426 on Amazon.com. Similar to but less impressive than Oxford books. More text, narrower coverage, fewer maps and drawings.5. DK Atlas of World History, DK Publishing, 352 pages, $35.00, 10.96"" x 14.66"" x 1.28"" ranked 10,716 on Amazon.com. My last place book seems like a giant comic book. I love the DK travel books but this seems like one step beyond DK's area of expertise. Superficially it is similar to the Oxford book and it is cheap, and some might like it but it tries to be politically correct and fails.6. Oxford Dictionary of World History, Oxford University Press, 704 pages, $7,66, pocketbook sized, sales rank 330,000. Mainly terms, people, and dates but has a few maps also. Limited use but an alternative. I prefer the new Penguin book but this is the best history dictionary to buy.";1
16693;"""The Big Bang"" is, as you can see from other reviews, a brief history of the theory of the Big Bang genesis of the universe. Singh takes us through the material in his usual skillful style: foundations, some science and reasoning, personalities, arguments, counter arguments, and proof of the theory. not bad at all, and it's very much like the book ""fermat's enigma"" in its style and presentation.my complaints with this book are that it's cursory (which is expected), it omits huge swaths of material (including the past ten years or so), and it's a bit simplistic (which it has to be for a broad audience). not that i was expecting an authoritative source of material, but as a scientist i guess i was hoping for a few extra pages here and there. for instance the story of how humans have understood the structure of the atom is lacking, and the history of black holes is completely absent.if you like this kind of writing and the history of science and discoveries, i suggest you check out ""The Discoverers"" by Daniel J. Boorstin  and ""Coming of Age in the Milky Way""  by Timothy Ferris. both of these are written with the same amount of accessibility and both are written as a compelling tale, but each covers a bit more material. still, i think singh's accomplishment here is pretty good. i think it's fair to say that any college educated person should be able to read this book and understand it. he covers a lot of material in a clear and comprehensible way, and i think it's well presented.";1

266385;Take a main character minding his own life and thrust him into a whirlwind (Grisham - The Firm), allow that person to unravel psychologically (Stephen King - pick one), cause the reader to turn the pages faster than they can read (Harlan Coben - Gone for Good), mix in some killing that is hard to take (Cody McFayden - pick one),  feel the prickling of the hair on your neck as the detective can't quite put a finger on it - can't tell any more without spoiling something - (Thomas Harris - Silence of the Lambs), add a dash of dry humor (Robert B Parker - Spenser Series) and then keep the reader guessing as to how in the world this is all going together (Michael Marshall specialty) and this is what you get.  Oh, and did I forget, Marshall can actually write.  The characters, while not fleshed out in depth, are nonetheless life-like, likeable, and running for their lives.The ending is well, you'll just have to read it.I have nothing more to say, but add this one immediately to your Mountain of Books to be read.

571535;This is a very thick book with tiny print.  It is indepth and detail-oriented, and I recommend purchasing this if you really are interested in the background of the Scriptures.  It is NOT a &#34,Bible,&#34, but a commentary that explains traditions and customs of the times, and interpretation according to the early Church Fathers (in particular St. Jerome).  It has been beneficial for me in recognizing the traditions of the Catholic Church that have been preserved throughout the last 2 millennia.  The actual theology of the Church, based on Scripture and Tradition, are explained here in such a way that one can easily see and understand the roots of Catholicism and other apostolic churches.;1

And seemingly everything in between is spent slamming on Peter Criss. Apparently Gene hated Ace and Paul hated Peter.  Gene spent the majority of his book slamming Ace and Paul does the same to Peter. He does take moments to slam on everyone else...so he and Peter do have a LOT in common with their insecurities and prejudices. So expect a lot of that kind of thing. Don't expect too many sordid tales of life on the road as Paul doesn't go very deep with that ( which was fine by me, it gets old, quick).It's an interesting read, just gets a little heavy handed with the vendettas.....as the other three did, so why shouldn't Pauls, right?;1
135678;I was first introduced to Garth Nix a little before my 12th birthday-when re-reading the whole Anne of Green Gables series every month was part of my normal book rotation. I didn't know what a necromancer was, much less why anyone would want to write about a well educated young woman fighting them to save her father and a whole Kingdom that had never really been her home.Sabriel lives in a land divided by an old, crumbling wall. It's nothing special this wall, old and crumbling, nothing that would really keep out an invading force. Yet on the other side the Army of Ancelstierre waits with old fashioned weapons for something horrible to come over the wall. They wait in the dark because frequently the lights go out and any kind of technology fails them. They used swords instead of guns because the guns fall apart. All because of what is on the other side of that wall.But there comes a time in every young girl's life when she must embrace the inner rebel who lives inside, just screaming to get to out. Sabriel's moment comes just after she graduates a finishing school in Ancelstierre that also teaches charter magic and martial arts-when a sending appears from her father giving her the bells and sword of the Abhorsen. Interpreting this as a call for help- meaning her father is either dead or trapped too far in death to get out on his own-Sabriel heads for the old Kingdom, a land she may have been born in but has no practicle knowledge of-and no idea of the new dangers abounding within.Sabriel may be an Abhorsen-one of many in a long hereditary line-but this family of necromancers doesn't raise the dead to do their bidding, they lay them back down and send them back from whence they came.Sabriel knows almost nothing about this.Could she quell the tides of rising dead?  Interpret her father's message, travel through a world she has no preparation for with only a servant bound by the most powerful magic to keep it from killing her? Free a mysterious man trapped in a spell and bound by guilt for an act committed over 200 years ago that still has ramifications today?  Try to defeat an evil that has defied the Abhorsen for hundreds of years? And bring the old Kingdom into something back of the glory it once was?As the terrifying repository of knowledge on all things dead says on its very last page: does the walker chose the path-or the path chose the walker?I should mention that Sabriel can stand totally on its own and does so very nicely.*******Spoilers next about what happens after Sabriel. *******Next we have Lirael, the only member of the prophetic Clayr who can't see into the future and has dark hair instead of blond and sharp features instead of cherubic ones. Ostracized by her community after finally realizing she'll never gain the sight she becomes a Liberian in the Clayr's great library-which holds so much more than just books.  Working there Lirael becomes an accomplished charter mage and even gains a mysterious friend-the disreputable dog- who grew out of a statue and gains her freedom when she discovers her true destiny and identity.It's been fourteen years since Sabriel became Queen/Abhorsen and in that time the old kingdom has become considerably safer-but there are still areas no one goes. Around red lake is one of them. And it just so happens that Prince Sammeth's friend from Ancelstierre, Nick (who happens to not believe anything about the old kingdom and that everything has a scientific explanation) is funding a dig at a site there that people avoid as much as possible and lighting strikes far more often than normal.On the other side of the wall in Ancelstierre the King and Queen of the old Kingdom are politicking with the government so they don't sent thousands of refugees over the wall with promises of free land-when really they'll be walking straight into a trap set by a necromancer Sabriel has yet to catch.And back in the Old Kingdom Sam is plotting an escape from his necromancy lessons-as he is certain he is not meant to be the next Abhorsen. But his older sister is so clearly meant to be queen that the burden falls upon him. So does what any noble prince would do in the situation- runs away.And lastly the whole Gangs here in Abhorsen to face the biggest evil of all- something so dangerous it was buried not only in the earth but in seven layers of warded materials guarded by the Abhorsen, sought by many a necromancer- none of whom knew what they were getting into. This is not just a fight to save a life or a kingdom, but the whole world and may more after that.These books are amazing fantasy novels that manage to straddle the age gap between young adult and adult very well. They are quite scary, but that's the only kind of content that might be upsetting to younger readers. And since it's not nearly often enough you come across a real strong fantasy heroine who doesn't need anyone's help, they're also a big girl power boost. And funny and full of mystery and legend. Recommended to anyone over 12 or very advanced young readers who don't scare easy. I'm not exaggerating on this point- these books are full of characters and beings out of the worst nightmares.Five stars. A trilogy to read over and over.;1

573951;The basic philosophy underlying Trade the Trader is that applying basic technical analysis methods is no longer sufficient. The author suggests that traders need to take a second level view of things and learn to anticipate what those traders using basic methods will be doing in the market and positioning accordingly to take advantage. This bit of philosophy is definitely interesting and worthwhile of itself, but the book doesn't actually spend all that much time on that subject, which may disappoint some readers.This is not to suggest the book isn't a good and useful one, just that the title probably doesn't best reflect the fullness of its contents.So what does the book focus on, if not trading the trader? Well, just about everything else, actually.Tatro covers just about all the high points in individual trading. He has chapters discussing time frames, entry and exit rules, risk management, trading plans, and trader psychology. Mostly it focuses on things in terms of his own particular style, which is largely basic chart and trend oriented (no indicators). There are numerous examples and stories scattered through the text to help reinforce the points he's making. This is a stock trading oriented discussion, but most of it can be applied to other markets as well, so non-stock traders should not be dissuaded.My one little gripe with the book is that the author could have used more sectioning in the text, and maybe the latter part of the book could have been structured differently, but it's a minor thing. The chapters are fairly short, making the book convenient to read in small chunks, as I was doing during my daily commute. Also, the author's writing style is pleasant and easy to follow. Plus, it's a short book at just about 200 pages. Overall, I found it a good read and would consider it well worth going through for developing traders.;1
83087;This is the thoroughly, wonderfully engaging story of Dominick Birdsey, a likeable, complicated, rather angry man with a lot to deal with when we get to know him: a schizophrenic twin in crisis, loss of a child, a failed marriage, a career in limbo, and profoundly unresolved family relationships and history.Every character in this intricate novel (and there are many) is authentic, well-developed and interesting. Nothing about this story is shallow or careless.The novel has multiple and overlapping themes: twin-ness, fatherhood, cycles of destructon and rebuilding, and the long journey of seeking self. It's a heartfelt journey. This story sticks with you long after you've read it. I was sorry it ended.;1
12637;Agatha Christie&#8217,s Hercule Poirot was one of my first favorite detectives as a teenager. I cut my wisdom teeth on mysteries. A strong branch of my family tree is Belgian and an astute detective from Belgium appealed to me. When I recently came across the author&#8217,s ebook, Hercule Poirot&#8217,s Christmas (Hercule Poirot Mysteries), available for Kindle, it seemed the perfect choice for a middle-of-December read.Ms. Christie did a fabulous job of setting up a locked-door murder mystery. Her red herrings had me guessing all over the board for the true culprit, or was it two culprits? She also offered a delightful cast of characters, diverse and colorful. The plot was intricate and complex enough to hold my interest throughout the story.A mild disappointment lay in the lack of Christmas in Hercule Poirot&#8217,s Christmas. Granted, no one is in a festive mood once a body takes center stage, but the title raised my expectations and I would have liked a bit of holiday spirit, at least before the murder scene.Within Hercule Poirot&#8217,s Christmas, there is still the holiday madness, however, and this author&#8217,s superb writing is worth the read.;1

Although the title alone didn't really grab me, I decided to read it anyway and see if it contained anything interesting that I might not be aware of, especially since over 50% of my diet is protein.Unfortunately, it doesn't.Pretty much the entire book is a hodgepodge of stories about cows and beef, loosely ""organized"" together by time period.  At 200 pages, this should be a quick read, but I struggled with ""Beef"" for three months before finally forcing myself to finish it.  And if any of you have ever spent three months trying to consume beef, you will understand how stale it can get toward the end.  Rimas provides us with endless accounts of ancient cows, bullfighting, bull paintings, cattle ranchers, and pretty much everything you wanted to (but mostly things you didn't want to) know about cows.  Some of the information in the book is interesting.  For instance, I had never heard of an Aurochs (giant cow that is now extinct) before, and some of the information about cow domestication in Europe and the spread of cow diseases, but all of this would be much better suited to a Wikipedia article I could skim over in five minutes, not a 200 page book.  The book is interspersed with ancient beef recipes, which I did find intriguing from a culinary perspective, but which don't really offer anything other than filler to the story.Overall, ""Beef"" suffers from a lack of interesting material, and a lack of cohesiveness.  If your interest is in cows throughout history, ""Beef"" may be for you. But for the casual reader who is more interested in beef as a food product, I would recommend one of Alton Brown's books orFast Food Nation.";1

183373;...or is Aldous Huxley smoking crack a better analogy?  Either way, know that this is not your average comedy/drama/mystery.The best things about this book are the acerbic wit, unusual circumstances/story line, stream of consciousness style and quirkily (that a word?) endearing characters.  The worst thing about this book is that it's going to require me to read it multiple times and to consult a Crying of Lot 49 primer before I can fully appreciate it - which, on second thought, is not such a bad thing afterall.The base story line details the trials and tribulations of a woman unravelling a mystery found in a dead man's will.  The steps she takes to solve it propel her into a number of unusual circumstances where she encounters a variety of curious and extraordinary characters.  In fact, the premise of the mystery itself is preposterous (in an anti-utopian sci-fi kind of way) yet fascinating.The story line is by no means straight forward and many scenes seemingly come straight out of left field.  It is writing like this either turns you off or on - I happen to fall into the latter category.  If you're more comfortable with a standard three act play format where everything is wrapped up nice and tight at the end, then you best look elsewhere.  Additionally, there are so many obvious references (names, places, situations) to present and past icons that I wonder how many not-so-obvious references I missed.I admit that I didn't fully understand what I read, but it is the challenge of a greater understanding that compels me to do some research and read it again ...well...that plus it was just plain fun to read.  I'll let you know how that turns out...If you enjoy books like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or A Conferacy of Dunces then I'm pretty certain you'll enjoy this as well.  Let me know how that turns out...;1

592339;"""The Man Who was Thursday"" is a fantastic, bizarre puzzle that defies attempts at explanation or description.  On the surface, it is a spy story about anarchistic terrorists with elements of suspense and paranoia, as you dig a little deeper, a black comedy emerges, peeling back a few more layers reveals a philosophical underbelly, and it all ends in an uproariously enigmatic denouement worthy of Lewis Carroll.  If the book is, as its subtitle indicates, a nightmare, we all should hope to have dreams as sweet as this.The hero, Gabriel Syme, is a poet-detective (yes, seriously) who works for a special branch of Scotland Yard dedicated to apprehending ""intellectual"" criminals, particularly anarchists, because they tend to be the most subversive and therefore the most dangerous.  By operating undercover as a poet-anarchist, Syme manages to infiltrate the seven-member Central Anarchist Council, who alias themselves using the names of the days of the week, and fills the vacant slot of ""Thursday.""  The Council's main directive is to cast the world into chaos by assassinating heads of state, and their current plan, as masterminded by their president, ""Sunday,"" is to bomb the upcoming meeting of the Russian Czar and the French president in Paris.It is, of course, up to Syme/Thursday, who is always at risk of being exposed as a policeman, to put a stop to this nefarious scheme, to which there is naturally more than meets the eye.  As the plot unfolds, it breaks down (or builds up) into an indescribably wild farce, Syme's mission turns into a picaresque adventure of disguises, a swordfight, and several chases -- involving horses, cars, an elephant, and a hot-air balloon.  At the end of the book, a surprise is waiting, a strange detachment from everything that has preceded it, which slyly lets the reader in on its symbolic joke.  If not for its relentlessly silly tone and idiosyncratic resolution, ""The Man Who was Thursday"" could be a perfect sister novel to Joseph Conrad's ""The Secret Agent.""Like fellow British wits Dickens, Wodehouse, and Waugh, Chesterton is that rare sort of writer who is skilled in combining breathtaking narrative with irreverent and intelligent comedy and whose prose is as poetical as it is humorous.  The fact that Kingsley Amis called this novel the ""most thrilling"" book he'd ever read speaks volumes.";1
342375;When I saw this book listed on the Kindle Daily Deals, I was fascinated. I thought it was about children being moved in Europe during World War II. When I started to read it, I was hooked. I was unaware of the reality of trains taking children from the streets New York to the Midwest where they were given to adults to be raised or used as labor.This novel tells the story of two women and what happens when they meet. Molly is a 17 year old in a foster home who has one last chance to avoid going to &#34,Juvie&#34,. Vivian is a 91 year old who agrees to let Molly work off her probation by helping her clean out the attic of her large Victorian home. Over the course of the story, Vivian tells Molly her story from the time she and her family came over from Ireland to New York, to her time on the train and the couples that took her in. Molly begins to see the similarities in their stories and decides to see if she can help Vivian with one thing left undone in her long life.I had not been aware that the Orphan Trains really existed. The story in this book was powerful enough for me to do some research. Although some children did find good homes, many did not. Many were literally kidnapped and put on the trains although subterfuge was used and it didn't seem as if a kidnapping had taken place. The book brought a sad chapter of American history into the light.I have always felt that an historical novel can teach a lot. This book is a perfect example and I enjoyed it tremendously.;1
340864;This is a beautifully well-written story. It is sound and thorough. The characters are well-developed and inspiring. Such an experience it must have been to be a child on the orphan trains. You will be so glad you have read this book. Bravo, Ms. Kline!;1

89318;"I can't help thinking about those poor trees slaughtered for printing this book!!!This is the silliest and faultiest book I've read in years. It's an insult to the intelligence of readers and an insult to women. The pseudo-scientific tone with lots of statistics is just a disguise for a weak and biased thesis. Logical fallacies abound and the notes are a mess.Here's my interpretation of Wolf's ideas: Beauty is a very recent thing invented by men, women's magazines, the cosmetics industry and the plastic surgeons. It's an invention aimed at keeping women busy and unhappy. Since women are much more productive than men are, men would succeed in keeping women out of the power structure by keeping them busy in trying to look pretty. By keeping women unhappy for not being as pretty as the models in the magazines the cosmetic and plastic surgery industry would make billions of dollars by taking ever increasing shares of women's paychecks. Wolf ends the book with a sort of manifesto in which she invites all women to slow down with the grooming in order to free themselves from the tyranny of men, cosmetics and plastic surgeons. Ugly women of the world unite - she could have written.Now the problems with the theory:* Beauty is not a new inventionIt's not even a human invention. For more details on this check Desmond Morris' books such as The Naked Ape or Intimate Behavior or check the excellent Nancy Etcoff's Survival of the Prettiest.* Women have brainsMen, women's magazines, plastic surgeons and the cosmetic industry cannot control the minds of over three billion women. If that sort of control were possible the ice-cream industry would use it as well and promote fat as beautiful therefore increasing tenfold its sales.* The idea that women can unite against the ""Beauty Myth"" is tremendously naive. The reason why women use beauty as a strategy is because it works. If a significant part of the female population were to listen to Wolf's ideas and stop grooming themselves the rewards for the few women who would ignore the manifesto would be very high. With the increase in the number of women following Wolf the reward for not following her would grow exponentially since there would be less competition for men or whatever other reward there is for looking pretty. It would be an unstable system and very soon it would fall apart.The book is very weird. At a certain point, just out of the blue, the author states that she is still a virgin. Her virginity is not my business, actually nobody's business other than her own so why declare it? It sounds like Britney Spears. Now for me, reading on a book written by a Doctoral candidate a statement that she is still a virgin sends alarm bells going off everywhere.On another weird chapter the author gets very personal and describes again out of the blue how she became anorexic by the age 13 and all the suffering that followed. I take that as an insurance policy - you might not like my book but if I tell you how much I have suffered you might at least like me.Take my advice, save your money, save your time, and, for God's sake, save those innocent trees. Look around and get yourself a better book.";1
558585;I read a lot. Many of them are classics that I thoroughly enjoy. I have even read Hemingway and loved it. I couldn't finish this book.Their is more dialogue than anything else. The dialogue gets very confusing and repetitive. It seems unreal. I don't see real people talking that way. Now, that might be because I don't hang out with people who spend their lives in foreign countries and party every day and night.That's something else. All they do is drink, flirt, eat, and go to another party. They also insult each other and then are best friends. Maybe after I go through and read some analysis and commentary on it, I might enjoy it better. But I shouldn't have to do all that to enjoy a book.There are some that find this book outstanding. Great! Read on. This just wasn't for someone likes to read for enjoyment.;1

113928;I actually would like to award this book four and a half stars - it's not quite up to five stars, for me, but then four is underselling it. Still, it's a really good book to while away a long afternoon.Rachel Morgan is a white witch in a world where supernatural people mix with humans. Vampires, witches, werewolves, pixies, fairies... they are all part of the `modern' world in Cincinnati where Rachel lives. Her job in Inderland Security (Inderlander being the name for non-humans) is as a kind of police officer for the supernaturals but for some reason she's getting the worst possible jobs assigned to her. When she arrests a leprechaun she is offered a way out - the leprechaun wants her freedom and will, in return, grant three wishes. Rachel decides to take her up on this offer to gain freedom from Interland Security and a new life for herself.On the way she has to give two of her three wishes to her companions of the moment - Jenks the pixie and Ivy the Alive Vampire. These two characters are excellent - Ivy is spooky with her vampiric nature, although as she's not yet dead she doesn't have to exist on blood, and Jenks is just brilliant as the annoying yet fun pixie with a huge family.Ivy and Rachel find themselves living in a church and trying to settle down in some kind of domestic situation with all the difficulties of vampire and witch living together - and then Rachel realises that she's got a price on her head and is a Dead Witch Walking.Rachel, Ivy and Jenks need to pull off a huge coup for Inderland Security to remove the death threat from Rachel so they start investigating an important local businessman who they believe is running drugs. Things get more and more complicated, they run into danger and hook up with new colleagues. But is everyone as they seem?This book is obviously the first in a series - there are a lot of loose ends at the close of the book. They're not annoying loose ends, just hint at future explanations. There's a lot of mystery about Ivy - what did she use her wish for, for example - and about some of the other people that they meet in the course of their investigations. I certainly look forward to the next book in the series and hope that it will answer some of these questions, as well as setting more.;1
630897;This book didn't get the greatest of reviews by school library journal, but I absolutely love it. Oh, and so do the students.  The kids get a humorous kick out of how the friendship rules are reverse etiquette. Hands also shoot up in the air as discussion leads to how bad behavior can ruin a friendship. They really get passionate about How To Lose All Your Friends. If you are looking for a book that will lead you into a conversation about how to maintain friendships, this is a good one.;1
519916;In addition to being racist and sexist the book makes it clear that GE was a horrible place to work.  The book makes some excellent points concerning corporate presentations. But it paints a horrible picture of the GE environment.  I doubt this guy will be getting Christmas cards from Jack Welch. After 20-years at the company the author obviously didn't really absorb much beyond how to put together an interesting PowerPoint presentation. The author seems to find no irony in the fact that he was shown the door as soon as Welch left town.;1
69510;Wells wanders around Paris, gathering recipes from her friends, grocers, mentors, and even taxi drivers, that turns out to be fine, since she knows lots of people who cook brilliantly. What's even better is that many of the dishes illustrate the return to long cooking techniques, using less-expensive meats.  This is right up my alley -- I'm a braisen' fool -- and so far, I've been happy with everything I've made.  One caveat: Wells is no wine expert.  Approach her wine pairing recommendations with caution.;1
81090;I thought Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging was a riot, so when On the Bright Side... came out I couldn't wait to read it.  I was slightly disappointed.  Georgia was always a bit on the selfish side in the first book, but it took on all new meaning in the second.  I no longer felt I could relate with Georgia, she became the annoying, self-centered, never-was-all-that-close-anyway friend that always hangs around and ruins all the fun for everyone else.  Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the book and even laughed out loud at some points (like the nose comfy or Angus' new love interest), but I've always found that a book is much more enjoyable if the reader is able to relate to the main character and I lost that somehow in this sequel.;1
240129;Easily as good as Wicked Lovely, but really? Even better.I started Fragile Eternity, not realizing that Ink Exchange should come between it and Wicked Lovely. This has probably been my biggest complaint with Melissa Marr's books, because it really wasn't easy to figure out which books should be read in what order--because this really isn't a series. But for all intents and purposes, it IS a series and should be read: Wicked Lovely, Ink Exchange, Fragile Eternity and the soon-to-be-released Radiant Shadows. Now that I've read Ink Exchange Fragile Eternity is making SO much more sense.Ink Exchange deals with the topics of rape and drug use in an amazing way. Those who have been through such challenges will find truth and honesty in Melissa Marr's story, but those who haven't had to walk through those darker alleyways of life will still enjoy the story and the journey.Niall and Leslie are strong and admirable characters--Leslie especially. Every girl should hope to be as strong and capable as she.Throughout the story there is a thread of what it means to be a survivor, and Leslie, is a true survivor.And excellent, excellent novel, especially if you enjoy stories that take you to the darkest parts of your soul before leading you back out into the light.;1
372572;Having always been in love with any type of Greek Mythology books, I was over course in love with Josephine Angelini's Starcrossed. This book was a great blend of both Greek mythology and a modern day love story.One of the best parts of this novel was how the main character, Helen, seemed so relatable to the reader. Even though she does have powers, many teenager girls would be able to relate to the struggles of high school and boy drama that Helen has to go through with Lucas.Lucas Delos probably is one of my favorite male characters of all of the young adult novels that I have read. I absoulty adore Lucas and how much he loves Helen and that he will do whatever it takes to be with her.And the ending!! Cliffhangers are what always gets me at the end of books, and this one leaves a huge one!! I did not see that one coming at all! It's going to be a long wait till next May, when the sequel, Dreamless, comes out.Overall, if you love Greek mythology and romance combined, then this book is for you! Starcrossed is a fun, unique book and should be read by all!;1

The Alchemist is a heck of a first step toward helping find out the answers to those questions. It really is written with an otherworldly purpose in mind. It's a story that will never get old, won't lose inspiration and it won't ever die.It took me two days to read about Santiago, a young shepard who has dreams of travel and seeing the world. On what had the potential of being an ordinary day, he is moved to search for his ""Personal Legend,"" the ultimate point of your life, the reason for your being alive. Along with the trials and tribulations that he has to overcome, he learns many lessons about being one with the universe and what it is to be loved by God.This is no ordinary book. This is what you need to read to understand the forces of nature and why we're all brothers with every single one of them.";1
514599;A good companion to Dale Carnegie's books, which you must absolutely read if you're interested in this subject. Leil Lowndes offers a collection of brief, but to the point techniques which will make you a better communicator: anything from how to make a proper introduction at a party, to good etiquette in asking for a favor, to how to inject yourself into an existing conversation at a party.Not surprisingly, all of these techniques have very little to do with you, and everything to do with paying attention to how others feel, dress, talk, and their interests. Being a good communicator is about listening, not talking, and Leil's book is a great resource which will remind you of all the subtle things you can do to improve in this field.;1

184806;This is a very good account of a sadly ignored part of World War Two -- the campaign by German submarines off the East coast of the United States in 1942. The author has certainly done an impressive amount of research and this shines through clearly in a compelling account. He is lucky that the U-boat captain he focuses the tale on was one of the very few to survive the war and could therefore recount his experiences at leisure, but this does not detract at all from a book which shows how U.S. incompetence and arrogance in the face of a clear threat they'd been warned about almost cost the Allies the war.;1

9455;Flashman is a rogue, bounder, and cad: the archetypical anti-hero.  Duplicitous and sneering, yet publicly charming, the most noble thing he does in this opening volume of the Flashman Papers (12 in all) is to seduce his father's mistress.  After that, its off to foreign parts - India and Afghanistan - surrounded by historical figures and partaking of historical events, all told with wit and mocking insight.In the 1960's George Macdonald Fraser set out to write some stories set in the golden age of the British Empire - well, golden from a certain point of view, anyway.  To do this, he set an anti-hero loose in Victorian England, and gave him free reign to do as he would, so long as he reported truly.  The Flashman Papers were the result - and apparently on first publication, some papers assumed that this was not a work of fiction, but a true history.Sexist, racist, and whatever else, Flashman is unique.  He gives us a new pair of eyes on which to view the past, and GMF tells the story in fine style.  In addition, the history that Flashman occupies is true, and (comparatively) rigorously footnoted.  Here Flashy is leaving school (as told in Tom Brown's Schooldays) and joining the Army, getting mixed up in the great events of the day.This is superb reading, true history written as fiction.  It is both laugh out loud funny and sombering, a wonderful window into the past.;1

108420;A working-class boy lives with his crude father in the Porter's Lodge of St Oswald's, an ancient and grand-looking day school for the middle classes.  He develops a love-hate relationship with it: he wants to become part of it, and once inside, he wants to bring it down.  It stretches credulity somewhat that he managed first to insinuate himself, in stolen school uniform and under an assumed name, into St Oswald's.  It has some thousand pupils, so that neither teachers nor pupils can expect to know every boy.  Then later, under another assumed name, he manages to join the teaching staff, so he can now plot the school's destruction from the inside.  Once we have overcome our  disbelief at such an unlikely basic situation, we can appreciate the  descriptions of the life and lay-out of the school, the tensions in the Staff Common Room, the clash between traditional and modern educational ideas, and above all the tension as the plot develops make it an unputdownable read. The parts dealing with the boy's time as a schoolboy bring out beautifully how he is torn between love and hate,  but by the time he has returned as a member of staff he has become pure Iago, so devilishly evil and so successful in his evil-doings that it made for me quite repellent reading, brilliantly though it is done.  A delightful Mr Chips-like schoolmaster is the would-be Othello victim.  The ending of the book is terrific.  And to prevent this review being a spoiler for those who have not yet read the book, it contains a deliberate inaccuracy.;1
413194;The thing that stands out the most about these stories is how conventional they are.The first stories explore pre-contact Martian civilization, which, readers will be surprised and disappointed to learn, is pretty much the same thing as mid-century American suburbia, complete with dutiful housewives, pipe-smoking husbands, and idyllic neighborhoods with lots of little Martian children playing in the streets. You can almost see the white-picket fences, or hear the martian version of Leave it to Beaver playing in the background on some Martian TV set. It's all a bit much. The only thing that's really different about the martians is that they're telepaths, but that doesn't lead to much of anything - even though, presumably, a civilization in which telepathy is taken for granted would look very different from anything we earth-men are used to.The middle stories are, again, disappointingly conventional. It's basically just the American West in space. The martians are wiped out by chickenpox, clearing the way for brave pioneers from earth, destined to build a thriving new civilization of free men and women. That's what American school children have been told about the founding of their own country for generations, so, again, what we're really reading about is Bradbury's America. The new Martian society is filled with prospectors, whores, missionaries, saloon-owners, explorers - all characters that readers will already have encountered a dozen times before. Mars even has its very own Johnny Apple Seed. Curiously, savage Indians and heroic gun-fighters are missing, even though it's hard to imagine a frontier society without violence, or Martian survivors looking on with indifference as settlers use the bones of their relatives for flutes and whistles. The uglier aspects of the American West seem overlooked entirely. Much could be said about the nationalism and sexism that the Martian Chronicles takes for granted, but it seems sufficient to remark that the Martian Chronicles is very much a product of its time in this respect.To sum up, the Martian Chronicles isn't really Science Fiction at all. It's simply a retelling of traditional stories about Bradbury's America, dressed up in Martian props. There's nothing really new or challenging here. Even from the perspective of Bradbury's own day, it's all very conventional stuff. It's also true, as other reviewers have pointed out, that the science is, in many places, just awful, and the characterizations astonishingly naive. I don't find it credible, for instance, that members of the 3rd expedition would wander around Mars unarmed, even though they're fully aware that their predecessors all disappeared under mysterious circumstances.Just the same, Bradbury's writing has a lyrical quality that makes his stories difficult to resist once you're involved in them, and he did have a gift for creating images that linger long after the story has ended. Even though the stories are occasionally violent, their tone is, in general, humane, gentle, even idyllic. I think these are the book's chief attractions. People who read this book for those qualities will not be disappointed. But people who read it on the assumption that a classic of science fiction will expand your horizons, tease your imagination, or in some way challenge you to think differently - as I did - will probably feel a bit short-changed. The martian chronicles is mid-century suburbia and the American West in space, beautifully retold. Nothing more, nothing less.;1
496097;I am an unabashed fan of Jay Crownover and have inhaled the Marked Men series to date (some better than others, but all very read worthy). However, she has hit one out of the park with Better When He&#8217,s Bad. She prefaces this book with a description of a series that features a grittier, darker and more malevolent ambience than usual and this is not an understatement. The Point (the fictitious environment of this series) is reminiscent of a crime, poverty and depression ridden place where no one, utterly, NO ONE is safe.  Growing up here means you earn every breath you take and you develop life skills that are far from those found on a university campus, a board room or a master craftsman.  Instead, learning to operate outside the law via drugs, thievery, illegal fighting or running numbers is found in place of academic achievement. Shane Baxter (Bax) is no exception&#8230,he is mean, heartless, driven and soul-less, or at least that&#8217,s what he appears.  Coming off a 5 year stint in prison after being set up as a fall guy has him yearning for revenge for those who stole his 5 years.  He is committed to finding his best friend Race to determine what happened and how to exact the most meaningful revenge possible against The Point&#8217,s crime war lord, Novak. Enter Dovie &#8220,Copper-Top&#8221, Pryce, Race&#8217,s half-sister from his father&#8217,s meandering ways. She&#8217,s a product of this harsh environment but Race vows to protect her and care for her when he learns of her existence. Race has now disappeared and Bax wants information from Dovie. Well, you know the story&#8230,bad tattooed boy, sweet (but tough) girl. Instant apathy that dissolves into feelings the likes of which Bax is not accustomed. The ensuing story of their dance in and out of caring, in and out of danger (mostly in), in and out of The Point, in and out of pain, in and out of darkness and in and out of hope is a lovely, wrenching, sharp and powerful one.I adored this book. It&#8217,s beautifully written. I rarely highlight phrases/sentences when I read. I have highlighted more in this book than in any other I&#8217,ve read with the possible exception of The Sea of Tranquility.  Ms Crownover&#8217,s voice as a writer is stronger, crisper, edgier and more attuned to the human condition than ever. To pull one of my favorite phrases from this book, reading the story of The Point, of Bax and Dovie, of Novak and Race, of Gus and Reeves is like &#8220,kissing a candle&#8221,.  Maybe not for everyone, Better When He&#8217,s Bad was certainly a winner for me. Thanks, Ms Crownover for such a powerfully moving and redemptive story.As for y&#8217,all, get it and read it.;1

I left the book feeling slightly unfinished.  I wish the author had taken a stand and explained his reasoning.;1
595491;"'Mr.Sammler's Planet' attracts criticism for being too much an excuse for the exegesis of a series of ideas, yet to take this criticism at its word and to imagine Bellow's work recast as a collection of essays would be to reveal how these ideas require a novelistic framework for their power.  The ideas seem to be gestural and provisional, with little in the way of evidence or argument to bolster their claims, and a large fraction of their suggestiveness comes from the very fact that they are uttered by the persona of Mr.Sammler himself.The bare biographical facts pertaining to Mr.Sammler are salient.  He is a Holocaust survivor.  He has killed a man.  He survives through the generosity of an ersatz nephew, and exists as a witness to the times, rather than as a participant.  Whatever his likeness to Bellow in other respects, he is starkly different in regards the above.  Consequently, as one reads it is possible to repeatedly ask what would a Holocaust survivor make of the state of the modern world.  Sammler's actual take is but one answer.  Perhaps the core of his answer is the idea that a sense of order is ineliminable in humankind, be this couched in terms of a consensual or objective morality, or in the frankly religious terms of an existent God, and that we know that there are limits to the ways in which a human life can be rightly lived - this is presented as a tremendously strong and inspiring idea, a real wellspring of optimism.  And it is one thing for Saul Bellow, Canadian born and blessed with a stellar literary career, to say this as in an essay, but quite another thing to have Mr.Sammler, a resurrected victim of obscene persecution, hold this as his most sacred truth.Impotence is an idea explored repeatedly, along with the related notion of false potency.  Sammler is the embodiment of a kind of impotence.  He is, perhaps through his history, robbed of the arena in which to act - indeed he characterises himself as 'hardly human' for the ten years after the war.  Instead he thinks, and words by his account have no business in necessarily being translated into action.  They can and do exist for their own sake.  Being embarassed by this 'impotence', as is evidenced in Sammler's quotation of Hamlet, can lead to chaos and terror, to actions beyond control - to a false and inauthentic potency.  Potency has obvious sexual connotations, and this is further complicated by Sammler invoking Schopenhauer's esoteric theories where ""The organs of sex are the seat of the Will"", just as there exists a misguided attempt to make words potent by using them as a springboard for action, so too the sexual bloom of the sixties is questioned as an example of another kind of sterile potency.This last point is related to some unattractive aspects of the book.  It seems entirely legitimate to take the book as a misogynist tract.  No female character is cast in a positive light - condescension is the best attitude that can be mustered, the worst is overt abuse, with a welter of Neitzchean, or Schopenhauerean, invective labelling women malodorous, mad, their flesh criticized to the point where an incidental character is branded a 'dugong', and where reproduction occurs courtesy of the 'female generative slime', and female sexual desire becomes summarized in the slur, 'a sloppy c***'.  What the intention is behind all of this I do not know.  Is it a deep resentment of Sammler's against the fertility of youth?  His own amorous life is conspicuously avoided.  Is Bellow actually hinting at his own demons, which he can only discuss tangentially?  In any case, I found this aspect of the book stale and offensive.Likewise, the African-American presence in the book is of an over-dressed phallus-wielding pickpocket - a figure that cannot help but provoke a reaction in the reader.  As a further generalization, Sammler speculates that, ""From the black side, strong currents were sweeping over everyone...Millions of civilized people...acquired the peculiar aim of sexual niggerhood for everyone.""  My edition of the novel is without Stanley Crouch's introduction, where such issues are apparently discussed.  Still, Bellow's motivations might be simply to uncover the power of prejudice, to level the pessimistic charge that humans are inherently tempted to be prejudiced.  Another instance is cited where Sammler's Polish rescuer, Cieslakiewicz, reverts to his native anti-Semitism in the years after the war, having risked his life to save Sammler during.  Perhaps we are all being asked to recognise our own capacity for prejudice and our own capacity to overcome the same.The misogyny and prejudice present in the book again highlight how it is a novel and not a camouflaged series of essays.  Our reactions are constrained and conditioned by the very fact that we are reading a work of fiction, and that an unspecified distance lies between the views mouthed by the characters and those of the author.The word surface is easily digested, often being broken into ready mouthfuls as in a telegram.  It seems a mimicry of fragmentary thoughts, pouring through a mind that mainly has itself for company.  This inwardness lends it coherence and a rather cloying self-righteousness, there certainly is a strict limit to this mind's capacity for self-criticism, as distinct from judging others, which Sammler does instinctively, even if under the disingenuous guise of indifference.  It is a voice poorly suited to outward communication, and Sammler's quoted conversation is often brief and awkward, his interjections being pleas for his interlocutor to regain silence.  Worst of all is his interminable interaction with his Indian alter-ego, Dr.Lal - if this is an example of an 'essay', then I'm afraid it is confused, confusing, and lame. Lal's moon-related musings are equally vapid. Wyndham Lewis once characterised Joyce's 'Ulysses' as 'a record diarrhea' - Sammler offers some stiff competition.The plot, as described elsewhere, is simple and stupid.  The minor characters are chastised cartoons.  You certainly do not keep reading for any one of these factors, rather it is for the crazed amalgam of them all. For all its apparent order, this novel is a mess, and there is no other medium apart from a novel that accommodates a mess so well.  It is hard for me to think of another novel that investigates the same territory as ""Mr.Sammler's Planet"" - a septuagenarian Holocaust survivor, surrounded by the giddying turmoil of Sixties New York, crushing a collage of disparate elements into his own, one-eyed, unique view.  Despite Sammler's claims that, 'this liberation into individuality has not been a great success', this novel appears to be evidence to the contrary.  It stands alone, another instance of the basic mystery of subjectivity.";1

389114;"For a feminist, Maisie Dobbs is the ultimate detective. She isn't deceptively cozy (think Miss Marple) or exaggeratedly macho. Nor is she a mere sidekick to a lordly sleuth, like Harriet Vane or Barbara Havers. Both psychologist and criminal investigator, Maisie is in the vanguard of women's early-20th-century transition from conventional Edwardian wives to well-educated, independent professionals who vote, drive, and are in no haste to marry.Beginning in 1929, with extensive flashbacks to Maisie's early life and World War I experiences, Jacqueline Winspear's series now takes us to 1933, an era in which another international conflagration threatens. In LEAVING EVERYTHING MOST LOVED (the title paraphrases a line from Dante's Paradiso), Maisie comes to grips with two apparently unrelated cases: a murdered Indian woman, Usha Pramal, and a missing teenage boy.From the first, it is clear, Maisie recognizes something of herself in the victim: Usha had a college degree and a rebellious streak, she sidestepped the customs of her native land by emigrating to London as governess to a family returning home to England. Maisie, born to humble parents, was raised up and educated by the wealthy Compton family, for whom she originally worked as a servant and whose scion, James, now wants to marry her. Both women have ventured beyond their traditional place in society in search of their true selves. Their outsider perspective has made them keen observers, but it may also put them in danger.They are similar in another way. Maisie discovers that Usha seems to have had a powerfully charismatic presence, with her beauty, her vivid silk saris, and her extraordinary healing powers: Using what we would now call ""alternative medicine"" --- touch therapy, herbs, dietary advice --- she helped the sick and charmed all those who crossed her path. Except her murderer, that is.Maisie, in turn, learned unorthodox methods of investigation from her mentors, the late detective/physician Dr. Maurice Blanche and Dr. Basil Khan, a blind yogic sage from Ceylon. Thus, she solves mysteries not just with her rational mind but also with a deep grasp of emotional texture and connection (""Trust coincidence,"" Blanche told her), and she meditates in order to focus her thoughts and relieve worry or doubt. Both Maisie and Usha, in other words, dare to draw on less conventional sources of enlightenment.Conveniently, Dr. Blanche also left Maisie a fortune, so she is now a woman of means quite apart from what she earns from her business as a private investigator. In her New Age-y sensibility, her entrepreneurial vigor, her willingness to cohabit outside of marriage, even her choice of a sporty little MG, Maisie is eminently recognizable to our era --- and hardly typical of her own. Okay, she is a pioneer and (I hate the term) role model, but still, she sometimes seems a little too modern, in my opinion, and dangerously perfect. Couldn't she be in love with a chauvinist? Couldn't she have unprogressive opinions (even Eleanor Roosevelt did in the 1930s)? Couldn't she dress without style, or eat too much?At times, too, Winspear is guilty of letting her research show, particularly when she is describing the fashions of the day or dwelling on the design and provenance of a tube station. (If you've ever seen a movie in which close-ups of the d&eacute,cor and costumes outshine the drama, you'll know what I mean.)These quibbles aside, the series is a class act (even the cover designs, in the style of poster art of the period, are marvelous). Jacqueline Winspear based Maisie's story in part on her own family history, and she gives the reader a real and passionate sense of just how profoundly the First World War altered individuals --- indeed, a whole society. Maisie is scarred body and soul by her years as a battlefield nurse: ""Perhaps more than anything else,"" she muses, ""going to war had changed her life.""Like its nine predecessors, LEAVING EVERYTHING MOST LOVED is consistently intelligent and complex, though I must confess that I was less interested in the whodunit aspect and more in Maisie herself and her appealing associates, especially the war-damaged Cockney, Billy Beale, and Sandra Tapley, an observant and efficient widow with a thirst for higher education. Of course, there is a crusty Scotland Yard inspector as well, practically a requirement in a novel of this sort!In the end, Maisie uncovers the true story behind the murder, survives a gripping confrontation with the killer --- the hero of the day is a Golden Retriever --- and makes the decision that has been looming over the entire book. In the next installment, she is bound to find herself in new territory, be it emotional, geographical...or both. I'll definitely be going along for the ride.- Kathy Weissman";1

601282;As a fellow depressive, I agree with a lot of things Lauren Slater writes about depression, and especially with her feelings of loss of creativity whilst taking medication. I experienced the same thing. I've given the book three stars because I found her writing oddly flat, and even with Prozac as a reason for this, I still found it an uninspiring read- unlike Elizabeth Wurtzel's Prozac Nation, which was so well written I could hardly read more than 10 pages at a time without having to go and do something to cheer myself up. Still, some good points are made in this book, and I wouldn't _not_ recommend it.;1
568221;The strategies presented in this book are extremely actionable. The prose is clear and concise, and cases are offered which demonstrate the effectiveness of each strategy.

600821;"Okay. Finished another Eco book. Unsatisfied, again. Brilliant and beautiful writer that takes you in circle after circle after circle after circle until you arrive finally at - nowhere. I did not find it difficult to read as many reviewers have mentioned (except sometimes the broken and halting German/English that the Jesuit spoke) nor did I find problems in the translation from the original Italian. Eco writes masterfully. As I've mentioned in a previous Eco review, if you have hours upon hours to spend simply to be taken away into a world of words and ideas without any expectation of ""resolution"" then Eco is the writer for you. I understand ""The Name of the Rose"" is good but I can't imagine offering myself up to Eco again. I'd probably find more gain simply browsing a thesaurus as a thesaurus provides more ""closure"" to its tale. After 1,200 pages, I am cured of Eco.";1
409294;"I've haven't read many of Christie's ""Miss Marple"" series having enjoyed more of her Poirot stories, but I found this a fine representative of the genre of ""little old lady"" detection that Christie popularized. The mystery itself is serviceable, with an 18 year old disappearance leading a young couple to become amateur sleuths with the wise guidance of Miss Marple. The result is a bit far-fetched with the killer having less of a motive than would occur in the real world, but it is fun to read about Miss Marple ""tut-tutting"" the couple's errors of judgment and false conclusions. As it was the last in the series you can see the difference of opinion that Christie had for Miss Marple, leaving her to solve her little mysteries as opposed to the finality ofCurtain (Hercule Poirot). It's obvious her love/hate for Poirot didn't extend to Miss Marple. I doubt if this will make go back to the Marple books I haven't read, but it was a fun little mystery.";1

75933;Serena Charters is a talented artist who weaves magnificent tapestries using the mysterious designs that she sees in her dreams.  When her estranged grandmother, who raised Serena and taught her the secrets of weaving dies in a mysterious fire, Serena is stunned to receive her inheritance.  Her crafty, suspicious grandmother has written a cryptic note which accompanies four pages of a centuries old illuminated manuscript.  The note hints at a legacy passed down for more than a thousand years from one woman to another.  Serena is to be the new protector of a priceless manuscript --- but only if she can figure out where her grandmother hid the treasure.  Serena turns for professional help to Erik North, a reclusive manuscript appraiser whose passion for the past makes him the ideal companion on her quest for the truth about the manuscript.  But both Serena and Erik are linked more closely to the hidden treasure and to each other than they can imagine. The secrets of the manuscript put both Serena and Erik from an unseen enemy who murdered Serena's grandmother and has killed many times before to possess the manuscript.  Serena and Erik must go on the run to keep ahead of this enemy and uncover the ancient text.  Lowell has written a gripping suspense novel that will fascinate and thrill the reader.  The story unfolds and provides details about weaving and illuminating manuscripts that are an absorbing pleasure. Lowell's dialogue is snappy and realistic, making every scene a pleasure.;1
329238;To be honest, I had no idea there was a TV show based on this book.  I listened to the audiobook version of this and I loved the girl who narrated Emma/Sutton.  Maybe the way she read it made the difference?  Anyway, I absolutely loved it!!!;1
254887;This book surprised me in two related ways: (1) it's readability. I love non-fiction, but stories like this one can be dense, and this was a quick read. (2) it's depth. Iweala's ability as a writer to deeply tell these stories of AIDS in his native Nigeria in a way that made the reading of it both thought-provoking and effortless was impressive. I have not read his debut work,Beasts of No Nation: A Novel, but I plan to do so after seeing how well he told a difficult past and story of a nation's struggle with acknowledging and combating HIV and AIDS.I am encouraged that Iweala and others are writing about HIV and AIDS because many people still have 1980s and early 1990s mindsets about the issue. Times and treatments have changed, and as such, the public's perceptions locally and globally need to as well. This contribution will be helpful to that end, as Iweala tells current stories from a variety of walks of life and stages of illness. I think his book is most valuable in the stories of those who live with HIV with the energy and health to advocate for themselves and others, pointing out that the solution isn't for us (be it Westerners or whites or non-infected people) to help the poor African AIDS victims but rather that any efforts we take are joining with the efforts already in place by those who are self-advocates.Two related points I saw as flaws:--the repeated evocations about abstinence being unreasonable. I know it's not the only solution, but it felt entirely dismissed at times.--the lack of focus on solutions and the failure to describe the ins and outs of ARV treatment, which he acknowledges has been a game-changer for AIDS in Africa and elsewhereI don't think he intended his scope to include those, as he aims to tell the stories and set up the realities and let his readers respond to the social commentary he provides, but it still felt lacking to me.My final complaint is that the repeated us of HIV/AIDS as a label can feed into the misconception that HIV *is* AIDS rather than the reality that untreated HIV can lead to AIDS. I have friends with HIV who regularly have to explain again and again that they do NOT have AIDS because so many people interchange the two terms.Despite the flaws, Iweala's book educated me and made me think beyond the pages of the book. For those reasons, I will recommend it to friends.;1
457489;"I have a lovely wife who when she sees ""organic"" and ""natural"" brightens up and when she sees what she calls ""chemicals"", like prescription drugs, darkens. I can't convince her that all herbs consist of chemicals and that some of them are potent and even dangerous. Dr. Andrew Weil, for example said some very positive things about Kava until researchers discovered it causes liver damage.Since so many millions of Americans are disenchanted with orthodox medicine, and I think the mind-boggling cost of medical care is a factor here, this is a valuable look at alternative medicine and some of the hucksters who are having a field day in it. One problem with supplements, a $32 billion industry in America, is that it is not regulated. Herbs and all the other ""natural"" products are classified under the vitamin regulations meaning their manufacturers don't have to prove they help or work. And they can always use those weasel words like ""improve"" and ""help"" and ""support"" in their advertising. If my car gets 25.1 gallons to the mile and yours 25 gallons can't I advertise my car gets better mileage? It's true.I though Dr. Offit bashes treatments such as chiropractic or acupuncture somewhat unfairly pointing out that people have died from their treatment. Does an orthodox medical procedure exist where people have not died from its use? I'm quite sure orthodox medicine has killed a 1,000 times more patients than alternative. Remember how we were misled by the push for statin use, blood pressure pills and low-fat diets for some 40 years? I was urged to take statins 40 years ago and thank God I refused. Very reputable studies now show that a blood pressure of around 140/90 will not increase your chances of a heart attack or shorten your life. Yet most docs are still pushing statins and b/p pills. And how many of them make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year consulting and shilling for Big Pharma? But there is also a dark side to alternate medicine. And Dr. Offit  concedes that orthodox doctors have paid too little attention to placebos and the power of suggestion. It is not just in the mind but actually changes the chemistry of the body, he says.Countless patients went to doctors who calmed their fears, told them they would heal, and they did. The reason the doctors also prescribed some trivial pills is that we want to have something to hold and put in our mouth to believe it will help. ""Think positive"" from the doctor won't do it.I think what this book teaches you not to be like my wife, glorious lady that she is, but look at alternative medicine just as skeptically as many today look at orthodox medicine.I, for example, got valuable information about anti-oxidants and that too much of them, can be bad or useless.I was glad to be reminded that Saw Palmetto doesn't work, and it didn't work for me. Dn't forget that ""more"" is not better. More can be harmful. The people who took large doses of Vitamin E actually increased their chances of dying. I think huge mega-doses of Vitamin C can also be harmful. Nobel Prize Winner Linus Pauling, who influenced millions to take mega-doses of the vitamin, died of cancer. As did his wife. But it's worth noting that he was 93 when he died.So maybe the golden rule is wiser here and food practices thousands of years old shouldn't be discarded. Must we really give up our delicious bread because some docs are warring against it? If you want to be a famous doc you need a shtick or Oprah. I'm in my 70s, have eaten a lot of bread and grains all my life, and I'm quite healthy.A valuable, important book. If I could only get my wife to read it.";1
135004;"Just like the greatest generation had their war, our generation (those born mid to late '50's and up to mid '60's) had drugs...tons of it. So even though I fortunately have never taken drugs, almost everyone I knew did or knew somoeone who did. Christopher Lawford brings back a time when drugs were very, very prevelant in our culture...that he has written a honest testament about that time is admirable. Everyone glorifies the 1970's like it was the coolest decade ever and it wasn't. It was a time when the country was falling apart, the divorce rate was climbing to heights unknown and kids were on drugs and honestly a lot of parents didn't care because they were so wrapped up in their own lives. CKL captures that era perfectly. The disappointment of the book of course is his leaving his wife and kids to find his ""authentic self""...come on Chris, as a child of divorce yourself...couldn't you have waited until the kids were a little older to find ""the most beautiful girl ever!"" Regardless of that for those who have had painful childhoods you will totally get this book!";1
614983;"The Neverending Story by Michael Ende is a book that I've been intending to read for years. I picked up a used copy a few months back, and decided that it was a perfect book to take on my recent vacation. The paperback edition that I have is nice and dense, and thus excellent for travel.The Neverending Story is about a boy named Bastian Balthazar Bux. Bastian is a bit of a loser, the kind of boy other kids pick on because he's whiny, and he's not very good at sports, and he's somewhat pudgy. He lives with his father, who has been very distant ever since the death of Bastian's mother. What Bastian does have going for him, however, is his love for books. I was completely won over by The Neverending Story on page 10, when Bastian steals a book called ""The Neverending Story."" The description goes like this:""... In short, there are as many different passions as their are people. Bastian Balthazar Bux's passion was books.If you have never spent whole afternoons with burning ears and rumpled hair, forgetting the world around you over a book, forgetting cold and hunger --If you have never read secretly under the bedclothes with a flashlight, because your father or mother or some other well-meaning person has switched off the lamp on the plausible ground that it was time to sleep because you had to get up so early --If you have never wept bitter tears because a wonderful story has come to an end and you must take your leave of the characters with whom you have shared so many adventures, whom you have loved and admired, for whom you have hoped and feared, and without whose company life seems empty and meaningless --If such things have not been part of your own experience, you probably won't understand what Bastian did next."" (He steals the oh-so-enticing book.)The next part of the book describes Bastian, huddled in an attic at his school, reading his stolen book. Glimpses of Bastian in the attic are interspersed with chapters of The Neverending Story, an epic adventure of a boy named Atreyu, sent on a quest to find out what is destroying his home, Fantastica. Soon reality starts to blur, however, as Bastian finds himself and his responses appearing within the book. And after that, things really get interesting.I couldn't put this book down. The adventures are exciting, the characters are well-developed and unique, and the linkages between Fantastica and the real world are fascinating. The Neverending Story is a bit like Peter Pan, in this latter point. Does what we believe in make a difference, in some alternate fantasy world? Is it possible to leave our mundane world, and visit a land of epic quests? Do people who love stories, and have the ability to tell stories, make a positive difference in the world?Here's how much I liked this book. I was reading it while on a Caribbean vacation, with close friends and the love of my life. My friends would call to me to go to the beach, or our for drinks, or to watch the sunset. My response would be: ""yes, just a minute, I just have to finish this chapter."" Enough said. If you love books, you should read The Neverending Story. If you enjoy fantasy at all (Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, J. K. Rowling, J. M. Barrie), you should read The Neverending Story. If you like poetry, and careful use of language, again, you should read The Neverending Story. You won't be disappointed.This book review was originally published on my blog, Jen Robinson's Book Page, on July 13, 2006.";1

161552;Waking Giant is a new book by Dr. David S. Reynolds who teaches at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. The book deals with America in the Age of Andrew Jackson.The book covers the years from 1815 to 1848. During this era the United States tripled in population and industrial might. The era began with the end of the War of 1812 ending with the Mexican War of 1846-1848.The greatest president of the era was Andrew Jackson (1828-1836). He was the first president born in a log cabin to a poor family, Jackson was also the first president not born into the gentry of Virginia or Masachusetts. He is famous for his defeat of the Bank of the United States, standing down South Carolina in the nullification crisis of 1832 and defending Peggy Eaaton in the infamous petticoat affair. Jackson increased the power of the executive office through the frequent use of the veto and his personal charisma with the American people.The other presidents in this era were mediocre to adequate. Martin Van Buren the eigth president suffered from an economic depression though he did a good job diplomatically. William Henry Harrison died a month into his term to be succeeded by John Tyler. Tyler was a slaveowner favoring the south. He is notable for siring 15 children! James K. Polk was an effective president during his one term in office. Polk led the nation to victory over Mexico adding more territority to the USA than any other president since Jefferson and the Louisiana Purcahse The era ended with the presidential election victory of  Whig Zachary Taylor the slaveholding hero in the Mexican War. He soon died and was succeeded by mediocre Millard Fillmore. Franklin Pierce was a failure in the office as the nation's 14th chief executive.Party politics was wild and wooly! Jackson helped found the modern Democratic Party while the Whigs grew weaker failing due to divisions over the slavery issue. The Republicans emerged in the 1850s as a party of abolition and free soil. Lincoln would be the first Republican elected as president.The era saw great strides in transportation. The Erie Canal was completed as railroads, steamboats, telegraphs, improvements in mail delivery drew the young giant of a nation closer together.Entertainment featured minstrel shows, stage plays and novel reading.One of the most fascinating chapters in the book deals with religion in this era. We see revivals in the great awakening, the rise of the Mormons and New England transcendalism. Brief accounts are given of the Baptists, Presbyterians, Methodists and Roman Catholics. America was a nation where religion was an important spiritual element in the lives of most people.This was an age of great native writing! Such authors as James Fenimore Cooper, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, the Alcotts, Theodore Parker and Margaret Fuller who were transcendentalists. Other important authors include Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Harriet Beecher Stowe and Walt Whitman. America became a newspaper reading nation as literary rates increased in the ante-bellum era.The greatest issue facing the republic was slavery. Abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, the Beechers, Elijah Lovejoy and others exerted their moral authority on the minds of Americans. Great leaders of the cause in the Congress included John Quincy Adams, William Henry Seward and Daniel Webster. The secessionists were led by such states rights advocates as John C. Calhoun of South Carolina. Henry Clay of Kentucky was a slaveholder who urged compromise.The era ended with the slavery issue unresolved. It would only be solved by a Civil War killing over 600,000 young men.Advances were made in the care of the mentally ill, the blind and the cause of women. Leaders in these causes included Dorthea Dix and Lucretia Mott. American Indians had to endure the hell of the Trail of Tears as they were persecuted by the dominant male white supremist culture.Reynolds has a textbook style of reporting facts. The book serves as agood introduction to the time covered but is not in the same league as works on the era by Sean Willentz and Daniel Waler Howe. The book is well illustrated. The book could serve well as a college textbook. I enjoyed the book and will turn to it often when researching this fascinating time in our nation's history.;1
248567;When I received this book, I was not sure my soon-to-be eleven year old grandson would like it....I didn't need to worry.  Today is his birthday and when all the presents were opened and family doing other things....the birthday boy was devouring this book.....often calling out exciting ideas he was seeing.  This is a great book..;1

537253;Thanks to Mr.Grisham for writing a clean book, one that I could recommend to anyone.Some books are getting so sleazy that they are ridiculous and unreadable.His book reminded me of The Grapes of Wrath,The Painted House was an enjoyable read.I personally enjoyed the characters and found them to be easily pictured as one reads the book,thanks to the author's descriptive writing.;1
630565;"I used to teach 2 year olds and this book was one of their favorites. Yes 2 year olds! Even though some children were a bit frightened of it they still loved it and wanted us to read it again and again. We used the book to talk about real and pretend and dreams. It was especially helpful around Halloween when the kids saw scary ""monsters"" on porches and in yards.I love how the little girl gets herself prepared to face the ""something""(down to the cute cowgirl outfit over her pj's). I also like that her parent's try to give a plausible explination of what may be in the attic rather then telling her she's wrong about hearing things. I love how brave the little girl is and how she faces her fears and stands up to the ""something"" ... although it looks too scared of her to be much of a threat.Great story.";1
464105;Excelent Read. Unbelible what risks this wonderful couple took..the follow of these children so interesting.;1
475921;I was disappointed that the author removed or certainly limited the most interesting character in the series, Joe Leaphorn, with her first volumn.  No problem pushing The femaie side with Bernnie as she and Chee would eventually be the primary characters.  However, if she was not satisfied with her fathers characters, why not just start a series of her own?;1
265089;In the style of Newberry award-winning Out of the Dust, this book tells a story using separate yet connected poems.  It is written in the words of Jack, who speaks to his teacher though the entries of his class poetry journal.  By following his compositions, the reader goes with him as he processes the loss of a beloved pet, discovers what poetry is (and isn't), and learns to communicate with and relate to a differently-abled parent. Enriching the narrative are poems from great authors, which Jack uses as inspiration for his own poems.As a teacher, I loved this book. It shows the process that we see every day as students fumble with new material they're sure they'll hate, turn it around and backward, and finally make it their own. Jack is an emerging writer like many of my middle school writers, and I applaud Sharon Creech (a Newberry winner herself, Walk Two Moons) for being able to map out that journey in such a convincing way.;1
378438;"Originally posted on[...]I stayed up most of the night reading this book. I loved it that much. I have become so enthralled in Urban Fantasy, I haven't read a historical in awhile. Eloisa James made me realize what I have been missing!Due to a misunderstanding and an innocent kiss, a prince ruins the beautiful Linnet Berry. Suddenly, she's a social pariah and the rumors of her ""pregnancy"" spread. Her aunt and father concoct a plan to get her married to an Earl who is the heir to a Duke. The Earl, Piers, also happens to be a doctor with the reputation of being a beast. Linnet decides she can get the beast to fall in love with her in 2 weeks tops, Piers decides he will never marry even if it is to a beauty.From there Eloisa James, weaves a story of love, that is entertaining, humorous and at points heartbreaking. It's a story about forgiveness, getting past ones pride and overcoming vanity. I loved everything. The cast of characters, the location and most importantly the story.From the beginning Piers is arrogant, truthful to the point of mean and brash. Yet, you couldn't hate him. He's rude especially to the young doctors working under him, his students. When you hear Doctors misdiagnosing patients, you can't help, but agree with Piers and his rudeness. Of course, if you're a House fan, you'll love the sarcasm and wit. Linnet, of course, can match Piers witticism, by witticism and it doesn't hurt that she's gorgeous.A great read, I think probably my favorite James novel.Recommended for historical romance fans and readers who enjoy a non-magical twist to classic fairy tales.";1
292724;I didnt like Robby and Olivia in the first few chapters, and I was about to give this book only 3 stars due to the fact Olivia and her grandmother annoyed me. Olivia has a special talent and she dwelled on the fact she couldnt trust Robby. It took many many chapters for her to fall in and then out of love with Robby. On the other coin, I did like how they courted and slowly had to fall in love, rather then the other books where they main characters were Madly in love within days. It's just too much. This book also had the funniest lines. This book took on more focus in Olivia's enemies, which was also interesting. It had many older characters in the book, which was nice. I did cringe when again, the author turned the characters into the same as every other book. Olivia, like Toni, Lara, and Vanda called their lover a Rascal. Kerrelyn, if you are reading this...PLEASE...stop using this term, and maybe get some new phrases for them. A Rascal is not a term every woman would use to describe their hunky man. Like every series, the same things get summerized...if I have to read one more time what a Malcontent or Blissky is, I may have to only give 2 stars. Since the book was funny, and a little different from the rest though I will give it 5 stars and go on to read EAT PREY LOVE. ALSO, Ignore the cover...Robby has red hair, and Olivia is Greek with Curly curly hair.;1
21708;Wolf Hall isn't really my sort of novel. The piece is basically a thorough history of England throughout the Tudor era. The prose is written in a unique style - almost flighty and humourous, yet with subtle and skillful analogies flowing throughout.Anyway, like I said because Wolf Hall isn't my thing I have little to say, although for me to read a 600+ page monster in three days, when its not something I'm totally into suggests a skilful author...;1
590311;"The Red Pony is an episodic novella.  Young Jody Tiflin lives on a farm in the Salinas Valley of California with his father, named Carl, his mother, their hired hand Billy Buck, and his dogs, Doubletree Mutt and Smasher, along with cats, horses, and other animals.  In the main story, Jody's father gives him a red pony which he names Gabilan after the nearby mountains.  He forges a special bond with the hot-tempered horse, tending and training it in anticipation of the day he can ride.  But when Gabilan falls ill, will the pony survive?  And what will Jody do?  It was made into a 1949 motion picture of the same name starring Myrna Loy, Robert Mitchum, and child actor Peter Miles, with music composed by Aaron Copland.The four chapters were originally published as short stories in magazines from 1933 to 1937.  The first chapter, ""The Gift,"" first appeared in the Nov., 1933, issue of North American Review.  The second chapter, ""The Great Mountains,"" about Gitano, an old man who comes to die at the Tiflin ranch, first appeared in the Dec., 1933, issue of North American Review.  The fourth chapter, ""The Leader of the People,"" about Mrs. Tiflin's father, who has a history of crossing the Oregon Trail and enjoys telling stories about his experiences, first appeared in the Aug., 1936, issue of Argosy.  And the third chapter, ""The Promise,"" about Jody's receiving another promised colt, first appeared in the Oct., 1937, issue of Harper's Monthly.  They were put together as a book in either 1937 or 1945.  Some editions of the book also include a short story titled ""Junius Maltby,"" taken from one of Steinbeck's earlier works, The Pastures of Heaven, but this is omitted in the edition published by Penguin Books.  I had read Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men in high school and did not like it.  I have seen portions of the movie version of his The Grapes of Wrath and did not care for it either.  Yet a lot of folks said that The Red Pony is different.Perhaps it is, but only in degree, not in kind.  It still has that ""life's a bummer, then you die"" sort of pessimism characteristic of Steinbeck.  We did this as a family read aloud and did not mind the death and disappointment because these things are part of life.  What was absent, however, was any feeling of comfort or hope for the future.  The reaction of rock musician Eric Clapton is interesting. He complained that ""the book just made me want to commit suicide. The Red Pony, I could not believe this book. It broke my heart, and I thought there is no happy ending to anything.""  After doing some research to see why an author would write about a story like this, Clapton criticized those types of authors by saying that they are ""alcoholic, damaged people with a poisoned viewpoint on life"" and added that ""as much as it was incredibly exciting and death-defying to read, it was not necessarily very good for the growth of one's spirit.""  I never thought that I'd agree with a rock star!  In addition, there are references to drinking brandy and Jody's lying.  In one scene, Jody is upset and shows a very cruel streak toward animals.  Also the ""h"" and ""d"" words are used occasionally, once by Jody himself and another time with the name of ""God"" before the ""d,"" and the name of Jesus Christ is used a couple of times as an exclamation, so I had some editing to do.  It is an interesting story, but I cannot say that I was overly fond of it.";1
530417;So it's true - we all already know this stuff anyway. But this does help in seeing what kind of people we are and how we react to change. I found the appendix that talks about the book more interesting than the book  itself.;1
192720;I like this book because I am drawn to Eastern thought and philosophy.  There are many nuggets of wisdom.  The main character is on a journey to find soul and I am also drawn to that theme.  His perspectives offer the  immense time perspective of Chinese civilzation, in constrast to the American time frame of a few hundred years.  That is refreshing and broadens my own perspective which can get bogged down in the impasse of current politics.  Woman however is treated as Other, and while that is usual in writings by men, is annoying to me.  So, one star is subtracted.;1
52892;It is hard to imagine the life of Nelson Mandela in apartheid South Africa.  This beautifully written autobiography does not create a world of oppression and viciousness, rather it is in large part an appreciation of the beautiful landscape he enjoyed.  Yet we know he suffered long years of imprisonment because of his political crimes.  Finally, he was freed and returned to a private life in his home country.  if he was bitter or angry, he did not express it publicly.  In fact. the reconciliation policy that he and others followed probably short-circuited any movement towards social breakdown and civil war.;1
592438;Chesterton writes a fascinating novel that seems to be about faith in the end, although one would not have suspected that at the beginning.  It is very important to remember that the subtitle of the book is &quot,A Nightmare&quot, (missing from most covers) when you read it as this helps to interpret the book.  Chesterton added a note to some editions to emphasize this.;1
608893;Great book, highly recommended.  Hard to believe these men survived.  With each page you dont think their situation could get worse, and then it does.  Great details.  Good movie but a great book.;1
154477;For A Few Demons More by Kim Harrison is the fifth novel in her Rachel Morgan supernatural fantasy/horror series. Rachel Morgan is a witch who lives in the Kentucky suburbs of Cincinnati in a post-apolcalyptic world. In this novel, Rachel tries to find a serial killer, tries to prevent a war between werewolves and vampires, and tries to stay a few steps ahead of drug dealing elves and very dangerous demons.Well, that is the really short summation of the plot anyway.  ,-)What do I like about this series?The world building is first rate - the alternate Earth where Rachel lives is a fascinating place, with its various intelligent races such as witches, vampires, werewolves, elves, and pixies living and/or working alongside regular humans.Harrison is great at making vivid and interesting characters. You deeply care about what happens to Rachel, Ivy, Jenks, and the supporting cast.Harrison is also willing to do what she must in service of her plot and story. In this novel she kills off a very likable character - and she does not shy away from showing the pain and fallout of that death in the lives of the other characters.I think that her writing has become better and richer with each novel in this series.;1
240667;"Yea, she writes more than anyone else, but looking into this--an era that some might argue is the best period of JCO's career--is just another reminder why this reader no longer reads her work: it's just not that interesting anymore.  There's just so much material by her that's available that's second rate, it seems odd that she's publishing a volume that even she has admitted she has not read.  My guess is that if you don't have enough of JCO's books on your bookshelf, you might want to add this one.  Or you could ask yourself, ""Which work by her do I most want to reread?""  If there's an answer to that question, I'd take that book off the shelf, and then ask yourself if it was worth the second look.";1
141028;"I saw the original movie to this book when I was 12, in secret from my parents who forbade me to watch it, and it has haunted me since, although I didn't fully understood why until I read the book...I can see how its easy for someone looking at the story superficially to view what has occurred here as abuse, but its important to understand that nothing that was done between these two employed and consenting adults non-consenual.  Elizabeth was always free to leave, she had a place to live and a job that supported her.  She didn't stay with John because he physically forced her to.  She, underneath her conflicting emotions on the subject, wanted his violence, dominance, and abuse.  Her true freedom was obtained through her completely voluntary submission and surrender to him, through being over-powered, taken, and led to the heights and lows of that submission by him.  She could only achieve it through him.Moreover, the ""violence"" in the book was merely their extreme expression of sexuality, a heightened version of lovemaking so deep, that most would not venture into it.  The sensation of moderate pain mixed with pleasure created an association for Elizabeth where she came to crave it as much as she did John's dominance.  Their relationship did not fail because it was abusive.  Indeed, what seemed like abuse was consensual power exchange that both needed and craved.  There were two reasons why their relationship failed. The first was that dominance needs to be responsible to create a lasting relationship. To lead a woman with complete trust in you into a situation that she will find emotionally damaging is irresponsible dominance.  When that much power is exchanged, its John's responsibility to make sure to bring her back to an emotionally balanced state, to make it ""ok"" for her to eat off the floor and watch her lover have sex with someone else.  But that brings forth another problem - that of love.  In order to properly care for someone to that degree when you carry that much power in a relationship, is to love them.  That may create vulnerabilities, which John was not prepared to undertake, because he was too scared of losing power, but it was the only want to sustain that dynamic.  To put it plainly, instead of pursuing his fantasies, he should have been more mindful of her emotional and psychological state.  When that much power is undertaken by one individual, the responsibility is commensurate with it.I find it sad that this experience was so damaging to Elizabeth that she went back to normal relationships, in which, of course, she will never find the level of depth and intimacy she has found in this one.  Johns' damage was lasting in two respects - in the wonders of the world he has shown her and in the emotional instability he has caused by his irresponsible behavior towards her.  There is nothing wrong with wanting to mesh violence with sex, or to have a man pick out clothes for you - if you want it.  What is wrong is a man who doesn't appreciate it when you let him do those things to you.  When he takes that much honesty and vulnerability for granted, HE should be spanked!  When he tells a girl who trusts him with everything to go and rob someone at knife point, putting her in terrible danger, he should have that power removed immediately.Its not the violence, or the power exchange, or being chained that ended this tryst.  Its irresponsive dominance and lack of love.  Everything else is tapestry differently colored. Who says that love needs to be gentle and kind?  Or equal?  who says that every woman must have equal say in a relationship, whether she wants to or not?  But whether we are on top or bottom - or sideways - we need to be loved.  That is a must.";1

580560;"I'd heard some things about Elie Wiesel's ""Night"" over the years and, being interested in most things Holocaust-related, I couldn't very well pass up the opportunity to read this memoir.  I expected to read about deplorable and inhumane treatment and conditions, I got that.  What captured my attention in Wiesel's story, however, was the relationship between him and his father.  After following the journey of their imprisonment together, seeing how they took care of each other, making sure the other would make it, I was hooked.  I understood that the likelihood of the father's death was inevitable, but I still held out hope that this man, who'd survived as long as he had, would at least have lived long enough to see his own liberation--though I daresay that he did.  I feel badly for Mr. Wiesel in his lingering guilt over his father's final moments.After reading ""Night,"" I'm left with two haunting images: those babies and the ""corpse... contemplating"" the author at the end.  Thanks go to Elie Wiesel for having the courage back in 1958 to come forward and bear witness, helping to open the door so countless other survivors could begin to tell their stories, too.";1

254380;Bianca knows that her second year at Evernight Academy will be much more difficult then her first, and that is saying something. Not only does she have to make it through the year without Lucas, her vampire-slaying boyfriend, but her inner vampire is starting to surface. She finds she is becoming stronger and craves blood more and more frequently and her parents say it is only a matter of time before she makes the full conversion, but Bianca's not sure if that's the life path she wants to take.She does try and make the best out of being at Evernight by searching around for clues to why Mrs. Bethany, the headmaster, admits only certain humans into the school. This way she can give Lucas this information, in order that he can report it to his supervisor and be able to spend just a little bit more time with Bianca.As the year goes on, Bianca's life becomes even more complicated. Hordes of information is being kept from her at the same time that she is keeping just as many secrets from the rest of the world. One such secret is her continuing relationship with Lucas. The only way she can really get out into the outside world is if she pretends to be having a relationship with Balthazar, but she feels like this in a way is being disloyal to Lucas. With a major Black Cross mission underway and a mysterious wraith following Bianca, her year doesn't get much better, but could it get any worse?In general I find there is a rule that sequels are generally not better then their preceder, but then again there are always exceptions to that rule, especially in the case of Stargazer! While I loved Evernight, Stargazer proved to be an even more intriguing read and moved along at a much quicker pace, picking up right where it left off. With that said it is best if you have read Evernight so that you fully understand the context of the story.Bianca's character was definitely more developed in this book as she started to really question if she truly wanted to be a vampire or there was other possible options for her. This really allowed the reader to get to know her better and for her to become more real and three-dimensional. One thing I didn't like so much though that she was the only character that was fully developed. To me the other characters didn't have as much life to them and the reader could have gotten to know them better.The plot was also much better in this book. It didn't take anytime for me to become re-interested in Bianca's story and I felt like I hadn't missed out on anything. There was always so much going on that I was constantly on the edge of my seat eager to find out what was going to happen next and how each event fit into the plot puzzle! Some of the developments that occurred in the story were definitely jaw droppers and I was absolutely stunned, and I have to say I loved evey minute of it!Claudia Gray really outdid herself with Stargazer. Her writing was fantastic and she created a novel full of daring, romantic, and shocking moments, all of which left the reader wanting more. She especially did a great job with the ending, even though it was a little odd, which left off with a major cliffhanger! I cannot wait for more books in the series and just future books from Ms. Gray in the future.;1

220729;Barbara Michaels is one of the pseudonyms for Egyptologist and mystery / suspense writer Barbara Mertz, and she's also known - better known, these days - as Elizabeth Peters.  The `Michaels' books were immensely popular at one time, and I've always preferred them over the Peters novels, primarily because the Michaels books were usually supernatural mysteries rather than your usual crime/murder mysteries.  That's why it's appropriate that she wrote this particular book under the Michaels name.It's a departure from everything else she's done, and it's a terrific concept.  She sets the stage in your mind's eye of a dark, foggy night in London, deep in the inner sanctum of one of those luxurious men's clubs of the Victorian era, and gathered within are none other than Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Harry Houdini, Frank Podmore (founder of the Society for Psychical Research) and a mystery woman we tend to think is the author herself.  Together, these legends of mystery, magic and the occult decide to analyze two notorious, early 19th century ghost stories:  that of the Tennessee Bell Witch and the Phelps haunting in Connecticut.One of the group will tell the story so that the reader can go back and re-live it, and then we come back to the present so that each `expert' can give an opinion as they smoke cigars and drink brandy.  They banter and argue back and forth, each with a different take on the events.This was probably one of the most creative and entertaining ways to analyze these two famous cases, and, spoken like a true fangirl, I say only Barbara Michaels could have told it.(for a thorough telling of the Bell Witch story, by the way, I recommend An American Haunting by Brent Monahan, which is a reproduction of a manuscript written by Betsy Bell's husband, Richard Powell.  I don't know of a similar book about the Phelps haunting, though.);1
248780;I usually dislike historical fiction, but this book was so full of action that I didn't care. Sisters of the Sword is a must-read for any book lover!I really loved the antagonist, Kimi and Hana's uncle. Or rather, I was enthralled with his evilness, if that's even a word. When you start reading the book, he sounds like the perfect relative, the one that you always knew would get the best Christmas presents, who you could always confide in. But, as the summary states, he ends up betraying his brother in the worst way possible. I went in this book not reading the summary, and I was so surprised!The action in here appealed to the Hunger Games fan in me. Now, don't get me wrong, this book isn't at all like the Hunger Games, but when I was reading the fight scenes, there were a couple times where I was remembering Katniss talking about the careers and how they fought. I don't know if everyone would think that when reading this book, but that's how it was for me.Also, Kimi and Hana are girls who are truly before their time. They, as girls, are not allowed to be samurai, but that does not stop them.There was one thing that I was wondering about: (SPOILER) in the book, Kimi and Hana become servants. It seems to me like they were too good at it,considering they were the Jito's daughters. But the story was so good that I was able to suspend my disbelief while reading it.In closing, it was a great book that I believe even reluctant readers could enjoy! I am looking forward to the next book in the series!;1

200434;This book is more a series of vignettes or little snap shots of a dysfunctional family in Thornton, Louisiana than it is a novel or story. Vivid, the book evokes pictures of family cruelty and ruthlessness. The whole feel of the book is disjointed, lacking cohesion and feels more bitter than meaningful. This books is a disappointment compared to her other, the Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood, which is peopled by the same characters (though is characterized nothing like them) and has more grace and redemption. Bypass this book in favor of Divine Secrets.;1

70685;The audio book of Edith Grossman's new translation of Don Quixote was a perfect driving companion for my trip across the country. At a whopping 40.5 hours, I listened to the 35 CDs almost nonstop but didn't even finish it in the car (though only about 20 minutes were left when I arrived).As I suppose I could have guessed, the text of Don Quixote is particularly well suited to the audio book format. Among other things, it's largely a book about storytelling, and many long sections of the book felt very much in the spirit of The Canterbury Tales. Characters enter, tell their stories to the main characters (and to us readers in the process), and then go their merry way. It strikes me as the perfect book to read to a child a chapter a night, as each chapter stands on its own as an isolated adventure or even a story within a story. Like A Thousand and One Nights, it begs to be read aloud in installments.Of course, the success of a good oral story depends on the reader, who needs the right voice, interpretation, interest, and believability to tell the tale in a gripping, convincing manner. George Guidall is the perfect narrator for this story. From the first pages of the Preface, I could already tell that his voice was the one I'd imagine for Don Quixote (and, by extension in my mind, Cervantes himself). His narration always captures the humor of the book without turning it into slapstick comedy and he effectively reads all characters, both male and female, as rich, distinct voices without resorting to caricature. For example, he characterizes his female voices by using a softer tone, not a higher pitch. He doesn't try to sound like a woman, rather, he simply conveys the fact that a female is speaking. I often find this is a challenge for readers of audio books. There's nothing worse than hearing a male reader go falsetto when reading a female character's lines.Also, though I've never read or heard any other translation and so have nothing to compare it to, I found Edith Grossman's new version remarkably crisp, current without being anachronistic, and generally easy on the ears, which, since I imagine that's how the Spanish would have sounded to Cervantes' original readership, strikes me as a success.In short, if you're planning your own cross-country drive, or if you have some other long-term commitment to solitude that you need to fill with a good yarn, I highly recommend picking up this audio version of Don Quixote. If you're just looking for something to occupy your daily commute, this might not be the book for you, simply because you'll be listening to nothing else for quite some time.;1

369130;First and for most I want to tell you how big of a sucker I am for stories set in or about the Titanic.  I love the Titanic just as much as I love chocolate.  I love learning about, I actually at one point in time wanted to go and see the Titanic....okay maybe I still do.  Anyone want to go with me????Any way when I first heard about the book I wasn't sure if I wanted to read it because I didn't want anything to change about the history of the ship.  I bought the book at a signing I went to in Naperville Illinois for the Dark Days Tour.  I had a great time meeting the authors and what not.  They were all great and I got some great books while I was there.  I have read some other Claudia Gray books, and I have to admit....I wasn't really sold.  I mean her writing is amazing and she is a awesome person to meet face to face.  But I just wasn't in love with her stories.  Then I read Fateful.Fateful was everything that I could ever ask for in a book.  It was pure amazingness.  You really feel for the characters, especially Tess.  You just want everything to work out for her.  Tess is a servant maid to a very wealthy family that is about to embark on a journey to America.  They are going to travel by ship....a very big ship called the Titanic.  While on the ship she meets a very handsome man that doesn't care that she is a servant or a maid.  He cares about her.  He would do anything for her.  He would even throw her overboard from a sinking ship.  Fateful is amazing....thrilling....and romantic all wrapped up into one great book!  Claudia Gray....you have out done yourself this time.  You have really wrote a piece of art!If you haven't read Fateful, you really need to do yourself a favor and do so.  You are truly missing out.  This is defiantly a book worth reading!;1
507501;"Seventeen-year-old Austin Reid has a newspaper clipping thumb-tacked to the bulletin board in his bedroom. The headline reads ""The Pride of the Parkersville Panthers"" and the photo is a head shot of a smiling guy in a football jersey. That guy is Austin - or at least, he used to be that guy. These days, smiling is an effort, in fact, just breathing is an effort and Austin doesn't know why. He just knows that he feels weary, disconnected from the world and entirely overwhelmed.When Senior year starts, Austin hooks up with Heather Mackenzie, the most beautiful girl in Parkersville, and things get a little bit better. He still feels like he's only half a person and he's still just going through the motions a lot of the time, but having Heather gives him a reason to get out of bed.Like Austin, Heather lost her father a while ago - his to cancer, hers to suicide - and he thinks that under her vain and selfish exterior is someone who's as sad as lonely as he is. But Heather doesn't want to look below the surface, and when Austin admits how he sometimes feels, her rejection pushes him to consider putting an end to his pain for good.Damage is a stark, unflinching look at  the downward spiral of undiagnosed depression, written with honesty and sympathy.";1
189456;"Do you remember at school when there was something that you didn't quite  understand - usually algebra for me - and everybody else seemingly did?  The last thing to do was to put your hand up and ask the teacher for  clarification, thus one would stay quiet rather than be viewed as the class  dunce. The psychology of my school days apart, the reading of Cloudsplitter  by Russell Banks has left me with a similar feeling. The book has received  a great many plaudits and I don't quite understand why. So I think maybe  it's just me,  that  maybe I'm just missing something. But unlike my  algebra classes I like to put my hand up!Described on its cover as `a  splendid epic' and ` A great American novel'  when I finished it's mammoth  758 pages I agreed with some of these assessments and indeed still do.  However, with the reflection of a couple of weeks maybe rather than the  pleasure of completion what I actually was feeling the relief of  completion.Written from the perspective of Owen Brown, son of John  Brown there is a great deal within the pages of Cloudsplitter that can be  admired. It is in many instances well written, evocative, moving and  extremely powerful.  But the flip side is that it is also repetitive,  boring, difficult to read and at times sleep inducing.  The strength of the  novel is in its depth of description both in terms of events and  environments. The reader gains an understanding of the hardships of  existing in certain parts of 19th century America. However, for this reader  there is a vast difference between depth of description and length of  description.  On occasions I felt length replaced depth and furthermore  became frustrated at attempts to flood me with language rather than lead me  with it.  The second half of the book - after Owen and his brother Fred  head off to Kansas - picked up pace and I felt that I had more invested in  the story. I do wish however that this could have happened before page 549!Narrating his recollections via written correspondence to a researcher  the melodramatic older Owen Brown suggests that he has become ""nothing but  paper.... a great disheveled heap of words"" and for me coming to the end of  the novel that's how I was beginning to feel.I gave this book three  stars because that's right in the middle of what I could have given. I  suppose this is because Cloudsplitter for me hangs in the balance, one side  represented by fine writing and the other by over indulgence. Ultimately  I'm glad I read the book but for me it isn't an epic or the great American  novel (living in England I'm never quite sure what the great American novel  actually is!).A measure for me of how much I've enjoyed a book is how  many times I'll loan it out to friends and family - Cloudsplitter I regret  to say will spend some time of my bookcase.Now about that algebra!";1
346071;"The biggest problem with Tepper's ""The Waters Rising"" is that the writing is about as subtle as a two-by-four across the head.  For instance, in the first chapter, the protagonist runs into the antagonist and we get to read six pages of soliloquy where the antagonist spells out her evil plans, actions and methods. What ever happened to discovering these things through actions as part of the plot?  We're treated to similar blunt trauma with most of the other characters and even the world, itself.  Plus, this brute force method isn't limited to just background information.  It's also used in character development.  Essentially, there's no linear growth of the characters as they interact with each other and the world.  Instead, they ""grow"" via a step function.  IOW, new character traits, thought processes, and emotional attachments just spring out of the ground overnight.The second biggest problem with the book is that Tepper seems to be so proud of her universe that she spends huge amounts of text describing it in agonizingly boring detail.  As an example, fairly early in the book, the main characters ask for directions to an abbey.  They get a three page answer.  And then we get a 50 page travelogue describing their actual trek.  Now, there are actual plot activities that occur during this segment.  But, those 50 pages could have been whittled down to something far smaller.  This type of clutter is so prevalent that it slows the plot's progress down to a crawl.  Because of this, I have to rate the book at a Pretty Bad 2 stars out of 5 and wonder why this book is so different from Tepper's other works.";1
595506;This book is a lovely piece of painful truth.  As I go through each of Bellow's novels one thing that stands out progressively is the assured confidence that grows and grows each time we cross through similar terrain.  This is not to say that he repeats himself--certainly not as the on-going  philosophy matures through both personal life experience and a further  understanding of human nature.  Seize the day is, as usual, extremely  well-written but with this short novel I believe that Bellow began crossing  into that phase of maturity that makes an author ever-lasting and forces  his vision upon the world at large.  It is no wonder that when Bellow won  his Nobel Prize twenty years after the publication of this book that it was  singled out for special notice.  Basically your middle-class everyman is  portrayed (with, of course, the particularities related to Bellow himself  to give the human reactions more sincerity) at one of those mid-life  boiling points when the decisions made will effect everything that comes  later.  You read along with a similar urgancy, rooting yet never hoping,  aware that many of Tommy Wilhem's mistakes are similar to your own and  breathlessly hoping to find an answer to your own questions.Four books  into Mr. Bellow's career I am now convinced that all the high-handed praise  is, for once, truly justified.  This guy is one of the true American  wonders, one of the gods of our literature.;1
154840;"I'm a big fan of Jorge Ramos' work.  It would be very easy for him to sit behind his anchor desk at Univision and collect his substantial salary as the presenter at the country's fastest-growing national news program.  But in Ramos' books, he shows a real reporter's ethos and drive to get out and get the story.  This is a guy who can talk to heads of state one day, undocumented immigrants the next, and be equally at home with each group.  The result here in 'Dying to Cross' is a compelling 'story behind the story' of ""the worst immigrant tragedy in American history.""Ramos also provides some forthright analysis.  In addition to documenting the tragedy itself, he notably faults ""the failed North American migrant policies, the permanent crisis of the Mexican economy and the incapacity of the Mexican and US governments to achieve a migratory agreement.""I read the Spanish language version of the book (released as 'Morir en el Intento').  For those of us learning Spanish, Ramos' clean and direct prose and presentation is a beautiful thing.  I highly recommend giving it a try.";1

16040;"First of all, my criticisms to follow aside, ""Moondust: In Search of the Men Who Fell to Earth"" is a very good book. Author Andrew Smith's idea of personally contacting the nine still-living Apollo astronauts who landed on the moon (out of a total of 12--three have died), to learn how the experience affected them, is intriguing.We follow Smith on a journey of discovery across America in search of the sometimes-elusive ""moonwalkers."" With persistence, dedication and luck, he eventually manages to interview Buzz Aldrin (Apollo 11), Neil Armstrong (11), Alan Bean (12), Gene Cernan (17), Charlie Duke (16), Ed Mitchell (14), Jack Schmidt (17), Dave Scott (15) and John Young (16). What he found by talking with these men can't be summarized in a short review. It's the subject of the book itself, and an excellent reason to read it for anyone who's interested in something beyond the typical astronaut memoir.The story of how the ""moonwalkers"" coped with their return to earth, and of the difficult psychological and emotional adjustments that they had to make when they realized that nothing they could possibly do in the future could ever top what they'd already done, is absolutely fascinating. For me, ""Moondust"" brought these larger-than-life explorers down to a level where I felt I could understand and relate to them as real people. As Smith correctly notes, when these nine men are gone, there will be NO ONE on earth who has ventured further from our fragile blue planet than a low-altitude orbit--a mere couple of hundred miles, as compared to the 240,000-mile lunar distance. There will be NO ONE on earth who has seen with his (or her) own eyes our home as a full sphere, glowing like a jewel against the blackness of infinity. An important part of the human race will die along with the last Apollo moonwalker.So ""Moondust"" is well worth a read, and I heartily recommend it. It has a few technical errors, as do many other spaceflight books. The Apollo project is one of the best-documented events in human history, and yet many authors still get it wrong when they try to describe the technology that got us to the moon and back. While ""Moondust"" is not nearly as bad as ""For All Mankind"" or ""Too Far From Home,"" it still has some errors. But I won't belabor the point, since the book is otherwise so excellent.";1

263831;When I first read this book, I thought &#34,Man, this reminds me of a modern day Wuthering Heights!&#34, It has that spooky, quaint, feel to it that I absolute love. I do see a lot of similarities between Immortal and Wuthering Heights, and I absolutely love it. We follow the journey of a strong but lonely girl name Evelyn, who goes by Evie, as she enters Wyldcliffe Abbey School for Young Ladies. The other girls shun her out because she does not come from money, and is there on a scholarship. Evie starts to miss her father and grandmother, and feels trapped in the gothic style mansion until she discovers reasons to love the school and to ultimately, herself.The setting of the story is my favorite aspect about this first book. The descriptions of the mansion and the wide opened land sounds absolutely beautiful, in a haunting and chilling way. It's like riding a horse all across this vase land while feeling free and happy, yet, at the same time feeling as if there is someone watching your every move. Evie is a very likable narrator, and I thought she handled herself very well against the snotty school girls. The love story in this novel was really fascinating. I have never seen a love story like this before. It's so dark and twisted, yet, I found myself rooting for Evie and Sebastian the whole way. I don't know what that says about me though :X The flip between the past and present with Evie and Agnes was wonderful. I love how the author was able to capture both voices, and made them each very distinct.There is so much I want to learn about this world, and it seems as if the secrets and betrayals are endless. Something tells me the next book is going to be digging even deeper into the past of this haunting little town..;1

While I do think a younger reader would get a kick out of the superficial storyline, the satiric undercurrent of its humor, as well as some mature content, really make it a more satisfying read for the older bibliophile. In fact, the more you know of the allusions contained (Rincewind's wizardly problems are a cracked mirror to those of LeGuin's Ged, for instance), the more fun it becomes.**This is the only Discworld title ""to be continued.""

In it Maslow sums up his life work and theories about the perfectability of man, and the need for the rigid, quantifiable ""science of psychology"" to incorporate more spiritual, humanities-based elements.Maslow grew up in a Jewish immigrant family in Brooklyn, New York. Stories of  pogroms and the Russian mass destruction of Jews were the reality of his childhood. His mother's instability may have been associated with her related experiences.  German extermination of the Jews in the 1940s extended these horrors into his early adult years.""Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs"" (developed at the peak of WW2) is still studied by every psychology and sociology student in America. For Maslow, that theory became a building block, a tool he used to construct his treatises on the nature of creativity, peak experiences, and self-actualization. Twenty-five years later, in 1968, still puzzling over the nature of good and evil, and the need to develop kind, good and thoughtful world citizens, Maslow wrote:""My study of most Utopian efforts has taught me to ask the basic questions themselves in a more practicable and researchable way. ""how good a society does human nature permit?"" and ""How good a human nature does society permit?""""What if the [human] organism is seen as having ""biological wisdom""? If we learn to give it greater trust as autonomous, self-governing, and self-choosing, then clearly we as scientists, not to mention physicians, teachers or even parents, must shift our vision over to a more Taoistic one...asking rather than telling.""This is the book of a modern philosopher, one who spent his life ""asking rather than telling."" We can all learn a great deal from the ponderings of Abraham Maslow.Kim BurdickStanton, Delaware";1
297569;"I'm not the core reader for memoirs about parenting hardships.  Nothing against the genre, but I have no non-adult children and there's a lot of other reading material that pushes itself to the front of my line. Still, when I heard The Anti-Romantic Child highly recommended on a contemporary culture podcast that I follow, I made  a  ""sounds interesting, must google"" mental note. I make those notes a lot, but this one must have been in mental bold-faced italic with a mental hyperlink, because I actually bought and promptly read it.The Anti-Romantic Child is about a very specific boy. Born to two busy Yale graduate English students, Benji  seemed at first to develop  well enough despite some quirks. The first clear sign that something was different came when he started to read, untaught, as a toddler.  That didn't seem a bad thing  to his parents, who had dreamed of a child who would love literature.His mother had intimations of not-quite-rightness,  but Benji seemed fine  to his pediatrician, whose Yale centered practice included many precocious and unusual children.  When it became clear that his interest in decoding words was masking serious communication problems, he was classified as hyperlexic.  Hyperlexia  is variously considered  a learning disability, an Aspergers variant, or a thing unto itself.After the initial shock, Ms. Gilman found and coordinated special services, including  blind alleys and disappointments, finished her doctorate, found a full time  desirable college teaching position, had another child, dealt with a failing marriage and a dying father, changed careers, and  moved several times.  And oh yes, she stays in constant email touch with preschool and school personnel. Just contemplating her life makes me want to take a nap.The message is simple: parenting a child who can't  share parents'  interests, or move effortlessly through life can be harder than, but as fulfilling as, raising child who's an easy fit. Predictability and preachiness are avoided, in large part because Gilman applies her  background in literature to life, and to memoir.  Her academic specialty and dissertation topic was the poetry of William Wordsworth. His verse and her reactions to it are sprinkled liberally into the book, in selections  well  matched to the narrative.Wordsworth  is mostly in today's public mind, if at all, for I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud. Yes, that's the one with the daffodils.  As you will learn if you  read The Anti-Romantic Child, that's our loss.  He has beautiful, emotionally complex and resonant words about not only visible nature, but also childhood, solitude, loss and consolation.Stirring  Romantic poetry into a memoir could be a recipe for a soggy mess, but Gilman makes it work.  Her narrative is very grounded, but her prose style is just elevated and personal enough that the Wordsworth interludes neither jar nor tip the book into a mystical meadow territory.I'll put a warning here:  if you could never stand English Lit in general and poetry in particular, you will probably not much care for this book.  If you believe self-reflection is just a nicer name for self-absorption and you don't like it by any name,  this is not your book of choice.This isn't really a ""learn from my experiences"" book with practical guidance for anyone with a challenging child. It does set an example of using one's specific resources, in this case a deep knowledge of poetry, but for someone else could be painting, craft, dance, sport, whatever the affinity, to  cope  with  and even embrace the unexpected.";1
422055;"""The 12th Victim"" (UK title)/""The Vanishing Girls"" (USA title) is Katia Lief's third Karin Schaeffer novel, by and large, I have to say I think it is her best so far, as long as you don't set too much store by the publishers' hype on the cover about the book being a nail-biting 'race against the clock thriller'.  Rather, the book is much more in keeping with the author's earlier style of murder-mystery-cum-soap-opera novels, published under the name of Kate Pepper, such as ""Seven Minutes to Noon"". While the story follows on from the earlier Karin Schaeffer books, it lacks the oppressive out-of-control gloom of either ""You Are Next"" or ""Hide and Seek"" (UK)/""Next Time You See Me"" (USA), despite its sordid subject matter as Karin and husband Mac find themselves drawn into the world of paedophilia and international child sex trafficking. Additionally, despite her close connections with the victims of the latest round of killings, and at least one of the detectives trying to track down the perpetrators, the focus of Karin Schaeffer's involvement in the case is much more tangential than in the earlier books and is in some ways more about dealing with the consequences for the victims' families than it is about solving the crimes. For many, this -- together with the protagonist's total inability to keep her nose out of matters best left to others -- will probably irritate, with at least half of the book feeling like over schmaltzy tangential padding. The beauty of the book for me though lies in the carefully depicted human dramas on the small scale which imbue the tale with a depth of reality and of humanity, albeit at the expense of any real sense of suspense and preventing the book from really making it into the category of ""thriller"".";1
470159;I picked this title because I do collect perfume.  I've also discovered I like to read books where it is, in a way, a character.I loved this book.  It was such a welcome release from stress, it was pure escape into the past of Paris.  It was beautifully written, and I found myself in LOVE of Eva in the first few pages.It's written in a romantic style, but it's not what I'd call a romance.  It starts as more of a mystery, and there's this - thread- woven deeply in the book of how wonderful it is when women have compassion or empathy for other women, and want to help other women, no matter the relationship.Wonderful secondary characters as well that really enrich the story.  I read the first 30 pages and put it down, if I'd read the first 50, I never would have, because when I returned to the book, I could NOT put it down and when I finished, I just wanted to tell everyone how much I loved it.There's no fowl language, and it's real without being 'dirty.'  It was a very classy story, and I think Grace learned a lot from Eva.;1

6723;"Probably the most astonishing item in this book comes from the author's interview with Babette (Willi Muenzenberg's wife) at the age of 91.  She was by no means senile, she was ancient, but in top form.  She had long ago abandoned Communism and become a sharp critic of that murderous ideology.  But she knew where the corpses were buried.  When our author asked her, ""But what about Sacco and Vanzetti?"", she just gave him a little smile and said, ""That was Willi's idea.""What?!?!  How could that possibly be true?The explanation lies in this book, which will really make you dizzy as you recognize the items of Soviet disinformation one at a time.  It finally turns into a case of ""wheels within wheels,"" where the dedicated enemies Hitler and Stalin nevertheless wind up cooperating with one another in a sort of Satanic waltz.  For example: Hitler wanted to eliminate a large number of German Communists.  No problem, said Stalin, and provided him with a list of German Communists that Stalin wanted dead.If you read this book, you will suddenly come to a very different understanding of historical reality.  For example, if you read that Felix Frankfurter and Lincoln Steffens both loudly and publicly deplored the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti, you will understand why.This is an extremely valuable book which belongs on the shelf of anyone interested in the history of the twentieth century.";1
303759;The author's idea is that if you ask yourself success-provoking questions you'll become more successful. He believes if you ask yourself how you have accomplished great things, better health, etc. that your subconscious will get to work helping you have those things instead of telling you why you can't have them. Doesn't work for me. How does this work for anyone? I ask myself, &#34,How did you make so much more money this month?&#34, and my mind replies, &#34,You didn't.&#34,  I tried a bunch of different questions, a bunch of different ways, and my subconscious or conscious mind or that voice in my head always came back with a negative response. This was actually detrimental because it made me feel discouraged. Maybe it helps some people but not me.;1

No writer pecking away in isolation, he takes us through war, multi-state politics, the halls of academe and his own great love story with the intelligent vividness we came to expect from his novels. I've already recommended it to anyone I know with the slightest interest in history. Seldom Disappointed? No, Mr. Hillerman, make that &#34,Seldom Disappointing.&#34,Only thing I disliked about this book was having to say goodbye all over again to this entertaining writer.;1
213050;ONe would think that such a rather dull and uninteresting subject as advertising could be a vehicle for the collusion of big business and other big brother types in the murder of innocent lives. What sort of skill Ms Sayers must have had in being so creative and yet it seems to me that in this generation of no-nothings our senses and thoughts are being &quot,tweaked&quot, by the underlying humour of Ms Sayers and she must be smiling secretly (smothering it of course, as Lord Peter has done so many times in his short career here on earth) that her very ideas are now being extolled and maybe even carried out in the press and now, lo, in the internet. Kudos to Ms Sayers, I still love Lord Peter Wimsey and hope that his nose forever twitches! Adieu, Mary;1
635254;"The premise is great, two old friends, now retired military men, meet in an old castle on a stormy night.  Years ago, both men loved the same woman.  Each has been harboring dark secrets for decades.  Tonight is the night they'll finally open their hearts and reveal the truth.  Afterwards, life will be different for both of them.  The problem is that while the idea was wonderful, the end result was not.The main flaw of Embers is the way the story is constructed.  The first half is told in typical narrative fashion, and we get an overview of the situation and all the characters involved.  Then, when the two old men finally meet and we expect the action and conflict to begin, everything slows down to a snail's pace.  The second half of this short book, a good hundred pages or so, is written as one long speech by one of the characters.  It's as if this man stood up in front of the other man and just talked for several hours straight.  While I read the first half of the book in two sittings, it took me over a week to plow through the second half because I kept falling asleep.  It takes a lot to keep me interested in prose that contains paragraphs that sometimes stretch three or four pages, and this book didn't have it.  Even at the end, when the ""big secrets"" are supposed to revealed, the reader will come away disappointed.I would recommend this book as an interesting period piece from an obscure author, but don't expect to rank it among the great classics.";1
565141;"Mr. Gitomer, Thank You! Your Little Green Book has given me the shot in the arm (Should I say booster shot?) that I have needed. You say it like it is. You get to the point of selling your idea. And I needed that.The most effective point you made for me was to change the pronoun. Instead of saying: ""It's so important for us all to understand the proper procedure to..."" you say to change the `us' to `you' such as: ""It's so important for you to understand the proper procedure to...""  Now, just in doing that I have become the authority, the instructor, instead of coming over as `mealy mouthed' or `universally sweet'. This gives me a whole new perspective on giving my information---in whatever forum I use.Now I (who look like a `universally sweet' person lecturing on a `universally sweet' topic like meditation) can still stand as an authority on the subject. It works, too. I've been much more assertive in my talks and have post-follow ups leading to sales and other lectures.Again, Mr. Gitomer, I say ""Thank You!""";1
57545;"There's a parallel fantasy world underneath our feet and above our roofs. It's a dark and dangerous place, akin to the ""realm of faery"" of ancient European folk tales.Most sane, respectable people aren't aware of the place. _Neverwhere_ follows the adventures of a white-collar office drone who, after an act of uncharacteristic bravery, finds himself drawn into the parallel world beneath London.It's a wonderful set-up, with vivid characters and settings, but ultimately I felt only moderately entertained by this one.Anyone who has read Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett will find _Neverwhere's_ style and feel very familiar. I'm frankly kind of burned out on snarky, arch fantasy. If this sort of work hasn't worn out its welcome, you may enjoy it more than I did.";1

541123;I listened to the author be interviewed on NPR, and he was asked why he didn't label the main character (Christopher) as having high-functioning autism, or Asberger's syndrome. He said that he was very careful not to label Christopher, and that virtually all of the characteristics Christopher exhibits (not liking food to touch other food on his place, etc.) was behavior exhibited by some otherwise normal acquaintance of the author. The author also pointed out that a friend of his, who taught mathematics at the University level, said &quot,Christopher isn't a child with autism that likes math, he's a mathematician with some strange behavioral issues.&quot,There's a hundred ways to look at Christopher, to pre-judge and categorize him, to dismiss him as a human being because of how you perceive him to be. The great triumph of this novel is that by the very style of his narration, Christopher brings you in to see the world on his terms rather than on your own. And the author accomplishes this without flourishes or tricks with mirrors--he does it with clean, concise straightforward writing and what appears to be a built-in understanding and empathy toward his main character.This is one of those books that is worth reading simply because it gives you another view of the world, a view that, while most &quot,normal&quot, people can't imagine it, is nevertheless a perfectly rational and valid interpretation.  After I finished it, I kept going back to look for passages because I wanted to figure out how the author did all this good stuff--it's been a while since I've found myself doing that with a book.;1
12691;Agatha Christie, one of the great authors! This story was one that kept me changing my mind more than once as to who the killer was, and Poirot's deductions were always interesting with a new look on things that most persons would not consider and, many times humorous.In fact, the story would not have been as appealing without Poirot.I understand that this is one of the first books written by Christie and, believe it or not, I have not read many by her, but intend to get started. If other readers have not read any of her books, it is time to begin!GREAT PLOT!;1
389762;"When I picked up the latest book by Rob Bell, I wasn't sure to expect from this man who causes so much havoc speaking so few words, said and unsaid. I've noticed that after he writes a super controversial book, his next one is super awesome. For instance, ""Velvet Elvis"" was really hot when I was in college. Everyone wanted to debate, ""What did he REALLY mean when he said the virgin birth didn't matter? How dare he suggest etc, etc"". And then he wrote the little tome ""Sex God"", which was PHENOM. Best theology of sex I've ever read. Go figure.So then, after the supposedly universalist overtones of his book ""Love Wins"", he writes this incredible little book. ""What We Talk About When We Talk About God"" grabbed me and wouldn't let go this time. I want EVERYONE to read this book, regardless if you think he's a universalist, a liberal Christian, or a crazy Christian. I can't get over how accessible this book is to everyone. Rob Bell breaks down the language we us to talk about WHY we talk about God in the ways we do--and takes time to explain that God is for us, with us, and ahead of us. Regardless of where the culture or the church says God is, He is who He is, and He is knowable, and He is also not knowable. And He is with us.

61479;This series about Bo the cat never disappoints! It has been fun to follow her through her international adventures and to rejoice with her as she finds her siblings along the way.

213917;I always enjoyed watching The X-Files growing up, so when I stumbled across this book, I was all-too-happy to get my hands on it.The book revolves around a case that takes place near the Xitaclan ruins in Mexico. When an archaeological team goes missing, Scully and Mulder are sent to track them down. What follows is a whirlwind of political issues and paranormal - for Mulder, at least. Scully remains a skeptic.The research that must've been done to write this book is astounding, I loved reading about the historical ruins and facts.Overall, I enjoyed reading the book, but I can't say it was the most exciting thing I ever read. To be fair, I didn't really get into it until around page 150 - when Scully and Mulder actually make it to the ruins. Once they got there, it definitely picked up the pace.If I didn't like The X-Files before this, then I wouldn't have stuck around long enough for it to get more interesting. While I won't say the start was bad, it just wasn't as interesting as the second half of the book.Because of this, I'll give it three stars. Definitely not a favorite, but worth a read if you like The X-Files.;1
601273;Has Orfeo something to do with murder of his benefactor? Well, it may behard to know, since nobody knows where he's gone, what his real name was andeven how he looks like!An excellent historical mystery, with contractual over-documentation but agreat plot, one of the most complex and bamboozling in recent history. Theending is rich in surprises that are really surprising, at least for thisreader. Italian atmosphere is remarkably done. Characterization is a littlemore uneven, and Julian Kestrel hasn't interested me very much, butvillainous cop Grimani is a great creation. The only serious flaw of thisbook is alas a frequent one nowadays: excessive length. It's very sad thatKate Ross died so young, after writing only four novels, of which this oneis the last. More would have been more than welcome.;1
161338;I find myself being angry, if one accepts this book as fact, on several issues.  Why did Louis and Marie Antoinette take the children out of France when they finally realized that Robespierre had the power and planned to destroy the monarchy?  If they felt they had the power to maintain the throne, they could have returned.  There was ample proof that there was no safety because of the executions already taking place and the unfounded accusations that were presented and bringing guilty verdicts.  This book follows Marie Antoinette from the time she enters France as the Dauphine from Austria until she becomes the Queen of France and finally what she goes through during the French Revolution and her execution.  The stories are much different than what so many of us have heard and Marie Antoinette is a totally different person than I had always thought she was.  I'm glad that I read this book and could revise my knowledge and like her.  REALLY good book.;1

487027;"What Should We Be Worried About?: Real Scenarios That Keep Scientists Up at Night by John Brockman""What Should We Be Worried About?"" is a thought-provoking book of scientific essays brought to you by The Edge. The Edge is an organization that presents original ideas by today's leading thinkers from a wide spectrum of scientific fields.  The 2014 Edge question is, ""What should we be worried about?"" This interesting 531-page book provides 153 short essays that address the question. The quality of the essays in this book range from a couple of one star duds to a handful of outstanding 5-star essays.For my sake, I created a spreadsheet of all the essays and graded them from zero to five stars based on overall quality. A quality essay to me is well written, interesting, addresses the topic, and either teaches me something new or uses the best of our current knowledge effectively. On the other hand, those receiving a one or even a zero represent essays that were not worthy of this book. Of course, this is just one reviewer's personal opinion.Positives:1. Generally well-written, succinct essays. High quality-value.2. An excellent question, ""What Should We Be Worried About?""3. You don't have to read the essays in order.4. Well-balanced book, covers the question from many scientific angles.5. There were a number of outstanding essays. The following outstanding positives cover an outstanding essay starting with, ""We are in denial about catastrophic risks"" by Martin Rees. Does a wonderful job of covering a range of end world scenarios.6. ""A synthetic world"" by Serian Sumner. He worries the natural world becoming naturally unnatural.7. ""Who's afraid of the big bad words?"" by Benjamin Berger. ""I learned something new based on research. The fact that no words is so terrible that merely hearing them would pose any danger to young ears.""8. ""The rise of anti-intellectualism and the end of progress"" by Tim O'Reilly. This essay really resonated with me. ""What I fear most is that we will lack the will and foresight to face the world's problems squarely and will instead retreat from them into superstition and ignorance.""9. ""Objects of Desire"" by Sherry Turkle. This is an essay that will resonate with parents.10. ""The is-ought fallacy of science and morality"" by Michael Shermer. One of my favorite essays. ""Scientists should have a voice in determining human values and morals.""11.  ""That we won't make use of the error catastrophe threshold"" by William McEwan. Excellent essay. ""Viruses replicate near the boundary of fidelity required to successfully pass information to the next generation. I worry that we will not devise a way to push them over that boundary.""12. ""Misplaced worries"" by Dan Sperber. ""What I am particularly worried about is that humans will be less and less able to appreciate what they should be worrying about and that their worries will do them more harm than good.""13. ""Unfriendly physics, monsters from the ID, and self-organizing collective delusions"" by John Tooby. ""Cooperative scientific problem solving is the most beautifully effective system for the production of reliable knowledge the world has ever seen.""14. ""Data disenfranchisement"" by David Rowan. ""We need to start seeing data literacy as a requisite fundamental skill in a 21st-century democracy, and to campaign--and perhaps even legislate--to protect the interests of those being left behind.""15. ""Big experiments won't happen"" by Lisa Randall. ""I worry that people will gradually stop the major long-term investments in research that are essential if we are to answer difficult (and often abstract) scientific questions.""16. ""Quantum Mechanics"" by Lee Smolin. ""I don't believe quantum mechanics gives a complete description of nature. I strongly believe there is another, truer description waiting to be discovered.""17. ""What--me worry?"" by J. Craig Venter. ""I firmly believe that only science can provide solutions for these challenges, but the adoption of these ideas will depend on the will of governments and individuals.""18. ""Natural death"" by Antony Garrett Lisi. One of my favorite essays. ""Knowing that our lives are so short makes each moment and each interaction more precious. The happiness and love we find and make in life are all we get. The fact that there is no supernatural being in the universe that cares about us makes it that much more important that we care about one another.""19. ""Classic social sciences' failure to understand modern states shaped by crime"" by Eduardo Salcedo-Albar. Timely essay that captures in essence what is going on in the Ukraine and Venezuela.20. ""Science has not brought us closer to understanding cancer"" by Xeni Jardin. ""The research and science that will cure cancer will not necessarily be done by big-name cancer hospitals or by Big Pharma. It requires a new way of thinking about illness, health, and science itself.""21. ""Exaggerated expectations"" by Stuart Firestein. ""Facts are not immutable, and discoveries are provisional. This is the messy process of science. We should worry that our unrealistic expectations will destroy this amazing mess.""22. ""Where did you get that fact?"" by Victoria Stodden. ""Without the ability to question findings, we risk fooling ourselves into thinking we are capitalizing on the Information Age when we're really just making decisions based on evidence that no one, except perhaps the people who generated it, can actually understand. That's the door closing.""23. ""C.P. Snow's two cultures and the nature-nurture debate"" by Simon Baron-Cohen. ""What worries me is that the debate about gender differences still seems to polarize nature vs. nurture, with some in the social sciences and humanities arguing that biology plays no role at all, apparently unaware of the scientific evidence to the contrary.""24. ""Unknown unknowns"" by Gary Marcus. ""Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom has pointed out that the three greatest unknowns we should worry about are biotechnology, nanotechnology, and the rise of machines more intelligent than human beings.""25. ""What we learn from firefighter: how fat are the fat tails?"" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. ""Only a rule of skin in the game--that is, direct harm from one's errors--can puncture the game aspect of such research and establish some form of contact with reality.""Negatives:1. There are just a few essays that were not worthy of this book, but just a few.2. I was surprised not to see more apocalyptic type scenarios including wars or natural disasters.3. Some essays are not really of major concern.4. Requires an investment of time to get through.In summary, I'm a big fan of The Edge and these types of books.  They're fun to read and provide many different perspectives on a given question. Philosophy is asking the right questions and good science is providing the answers based on the best of our current knowledge.  You should be worried about not reading these types of books.

199551;Kozol's Savage Inequalities paints a frightening picture of urban schools in the United States. He describes schools that are overcrowded, dilapidated, and flooded with sewage. He asks why we allow our children to go to schools in conditions where none of us would choose to work. He deeply explores the issue of inequality in funding. While he does suggest equalizing funding, he is careful to mention that the problems facing schools are complex and require innovative solutions. I know many teachers have read this book, but we need policymakers and elected officials to read it as well.;1
538981;This story is wonderful. Out of all the books I have read, only three have brought me to tears, this being one of them. It is sad, but it is also uplifting. There are many things written in this book that will make you think about your own life. A handful of the sentences, being so powerful, I will never forget. I will admit that I found the begining to be slow, but the person who suggested this book to me told me that this book would be one that I would not regret reading, and I do not. So if you are reading and you find the begining slow, keep reading, it is worth it. And now looking back, I realize that the begining had to be the way it was because it gave time for the relationships to build between characters in the book and between myself and the characters. (And if you are wondering what other books brought me to tears, they were A Thousand Splendid Suns and A Same Kind of Different as Me.) Happy reading!;1

14847;This book kept me up past my bedtime last night, although I found it not entirely convincing. Still, parts were enthralling. Ghosh throws together an American cetacean researcher of Indian descent, a translator from New Delhi, an illiterate fisherman, and the turbulent landscape of the Sundarbans, and comes up with a tale that is part adventure story, part romance, part history and resonates with the hybrid mythology of its location throughout.But while there is much to be savored in this novel, it flounders a bit in describing straightforward adult interactions--people explain themselves (in their thoughts and out loud) rather woodenly.Still, it kept me reading, and I was glad to learn about a part of the world I'd barely even heard of. But I've enjoyed other Ghosh books more.;1
392194;When I heard someone describe this book as being similar to the television show, The Bachelor, I was sold. I had to read it. Plus, I&#8217,m a sucker for a pretty cover and this one is just absolutely breathtaking.When I say I couldn&#8217,t put this book down. I&#8217,m serious. I think the only break I took while reading was to fix my children dinner and the entire time all I could think about was how much I wanted to go finish reading this story. It was so good! Whoever said this book was like The Bachelor was right, there was thirty-five girls competing for the prince&#8217,s heart. I loved the concept of this book, I have never read anything like it and I loved that.The whole story focuses on a girl named America. She was from a lower caste, so she had a pretty tough upbringing. I thought she was a down to earth girl, and I can definitely see young girls relating to her. I liked her a whole lot, but I did get frustrated with her a few times because I didn&#8217,t like how hung up she was on Aspen, her first love, especially after he broke her heart. I&#8217,m team Maxon all the way. I loved the prince! If I had been in her shoes, I would have been all over him from the moment she met him that first night out in the garden.I would definitely recommend reading this book. It was such a fun read!

565033;Innovation is a great thing to have in a company but how do you manage and plan for it?  That is the question at the core of this book as the authors lead the reader through a process that measures, manages, and profits from innovation.  They make the case that management of innovation depends on the right corporate culture as well as the right employees.  When it becomes a part of the corporate culture then innovation can be a regular part of the planning process instead of an erratic thing that occurs occasionally and can't be planned for.  Using a tried and true method they detail how to bring about this culture and the factors that defeat it as well as encourage it.  Once innovation learns to thrive within your organization it can be used to differentiate your product or service and its perceived value.  Insightful with lots of illustrations, sidebars, and other information that helps the reader understand the process, Making Innovation Work is recommended.;1
321358;"Elizabeth Marshall Thomas (The Hidden Life Of Dogs) loves the deer that traverse her New Hampshire backyard each year-- so much so that in her book ""The Hidden Life of Deer,"" she records her experiences with groups of deer she observes when she decides to ""go against the natural order"" and feed them store-bought corn during a winter when their natural food, the acorn, is particularly scarce.  Despite commonsense and official mandates issued by her local Wildlife and Fisheries that dictate that such unnatural feeding by humans could lead to overpopulation and danger for the livelihood of the deer as they divert from their instinctual hunt for sustenance during the lean wintertime, Thomas pleasantly, adequately and sometimes shakily presents her case to the jury of her reading audience.Thomas's prose is that of a thoughtful advocate of life on Walden Pond.  She oscillates between the sometimes bleak and harsh reality of a deer's lifespan and a rather Disneyesque state of anthropomorphosis where she brusquely dismisses the premise of Wittgenstein's language driven philosophy that suggests that even if a lion could talk we, humans, would not understand him. Like a wildlife psychic, Thomas feels that she can and does read the inner eye between the deer's furry foreheads.  She sees pain and hunger and responds to it as a veritable Mother Teresa of the Deer.  Nonetheless, she stands by the rights of the hunter as he methodically uses the satellite channel-hawked technologies created by Big Business to whittle down the actual sport to a sure-thing day-at-the-arcade.For the most part, Thomas, in spite of her obvious fascination with the majestic deer--she does provide full details on their lives from birth to death, seems confused.  Her Whitetail journey, meant to shimmer with shamanistic nuance, tells her little in the long run.  Her routine feeding of corn to the deer and teaching them to rely on a service that every hunter and wildlife manager utilizes to insure either the procurement of his trophy or the continued success of his lodge is akin to feeding bread to ducks and geese at a pond.  Of course, they will come.  From my own experience in a muley that doubled as a hunter's transport and feeder, I sadly discovered that the deer become accustomed to the sound of the motor, electric or not.  Like Pavlov's dogs, they associate the less than natural clatter of the mechanics to a dinner bell and within ten minutes arrive napkins and silverware in place.  Let's hope that Thomas realizes that she has created her own micro-managed farm where the deer have become accustomed to hearing her signal--perhaps the rattle of the corn in the bag--and proceed to the designated place for their meal.  Perhaps she should think of forming an alliance with one of the deer feed companies where she can provide her managed deer better feed than just corn where their nutrition is insured and chances of continued longevity increased.  Upon making the decision to meddle with Mother Nature, Thomas has inadvertently designated herself the Whitetail Goddess who must then, like a good manager, decide which deer need to be weeded out of the colony to ascertain that overpopulation and spill out from the territory does not occur.  What a job!Keep in mind, however, that Thomas allows rats to roam freely within the cabin in which she works.  A nature lover, I profess to be.  Nevertheless, living under the same roof as a rat the size of a large cat stresses my imagination to a frenzied extreme that would not allow me to concentrate on my writing.  In fact, I found her entire rat-infested tangent told as a caution to the perils of feeding any animal specie that eventually needs poison or other means to control overpopulation a rather dismal denouement that doesn't quite provide an answer to her original query.Bottom line:  In ""The Hidden Life of Deer,"" naturalist Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, in sometimes dreamy, sometimes harsh prose, poses the question: ""Should caring Gaia-hugging humans interfere with the natural order by feeding wildlife that cannot sustain itself or should we turn a merciless albeit conservationist's eye away from situations that will only snowball out of its natural control?""  Thomas provides some interesting vignettes about her property's observed deer families and attempts to understand and at times anthropomorphosizes their actions.  Whether or not she is taking her literary license too seriously or not is left to the reader.  I, for one, enjoyed most of this book, but I will caution some readers who may have a difficult time with Thomas's sometimes New Age vocabulary tendencies that detract from her overall message.

142531;"The one thing that bother me the most was the CONSTANT and VERY FREQUENT use of the words ""God's Blood"". This drove me insane and took away from the already sketchy storyline. The heroine of this book at many of times just downright got on my nerves. Sparks tried to make her both strong and independant while still making her seem fragile and incompetent and after a while it was just too much.One of the other things that aggravated was towards the end where Roman tells the villian is whole plan of attack. Ridiculous. The story could have been great but the execution was less than favorable. It took to long for things to happen and once things did happen it quickly ended. I was hoping for so much more and hope here other books will be better executed.";1
525312;"On its face, it's a book about Mark Zuckerberg, but a look behind the cover (and the man) reveals something else, something that I found to be the real core of Ekaterina's excellent book:  The heart of great leadership.She brings a lot of persuasive evidence to the table, including her own observations, to make a strong case that REAL leadership is not a matter of business plans, processes and procedures, but about building a strong and empowered community based on trust, passion, and a lot of heart.Once built, this community can take on, and change, the world - or at the very least create a very successful business.So it was, and is, with Mark Zuckerberg - the primary focus of the narrative.  Facebook HAS changed the world, and it's well worth our time to read more about how they did it.  Ekaterina doesn't stop there, however  - there are countless other examples she cites to support her take on great leadership, among them Zappos and Apple.We've certainly heard about all of these folks before, and perhaps you may think that given their extensive exposure in the press, there isn't much more we could learn from their leadership.  Ekaterina proves that thinking wrong, by putting their actions in the proper context, along with injections of her own experiences.One of these personal perspectives I found most fascinating (and inspiring) was her comparison of leadership to a hummingbird (Yes, a hummingbird!), along with 10 ""hummingbird-like"" qualities that are reflective of great leadership - qualities like fearlessness, persistence, character and intuition.  These birds are truly unique, and so is the ""humble but effective"" leader that Ekaterina compares them to.Great leaders are indeed a ""different kind of bird"" - and this book dives right into the heart of what makes them great.Dive in with Ekaterina, and be rewarded and enriched by reading ""Think Like Zuck"".";1

Still, the most moving part of the book to me was the story of the famine that the people of Malawi suffered through a devastating famine, how that famine came upon them and engulfed them, and how their government denied that a famine even existed.Read this incredible story and it will stay with you and impact how you look at life, people and yourself for a very long time.;1
531406;"Also published as ""The Demon Lover"" by Juliet Dark, this fantasy novel can be considered a compendium of themes the author loved in her previous ""realistic"" books. There is the heroine in search of her identity, there are houses which aren't just places, but are living entities, that groan and hide secrets. There are characters that live and meet in the present time, but are connected by a common past, or by intermingling ancestries. The atmospheres recall the Gothic novels and, in my opinion, a bit of the German Expressionist films, in this novel in particular, where the shadows are treated as living things.The main difference with her previous books is the fact that here fairy tales aren't just a reference and an inspiration, but they are real.Lastly, just like in her previous works, the writing is elegant, evocative and sensual.";1

491066;Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Tease is a heartbreaking novel that explores friendship, regret, and forgiveness through a teenager&#8217,s point of view. This book is perfect for any fans of The Perks of Being a Wallflower!Opening Sentence: &#8220,Did you ever have a physical confrontation with Miss Putnam?&#8221,The Review:Sara doesn&#8217,t really regret what happened that year- when a depressed teenager took an extension cord and hung herself because of harsh words from her classmates. Sara and her friends have been accused with criminal charges, but in Sara&#8217,s eyes it wasn&#8217,t her fault. After all, Brielle, her best friend, made up all the scenes that allegedly led to Emma&#8217,s suicide: Sara simply followed them through. Emma was selfish to leave such a mess for everyone over just a few jokes, and she deserved all the rumors, after stealing Sara&#8217,s boyfriend. But as this novel continues, Sara must learn to accept and appreciate Emma&#8217,s struggle and to forgive herself and others.The chapters switch between the times before and during the incident and after, when Sara is dealing with the lawyers and the stares. I really enjoyed this. It gave me a chance to not only understand what had happened, but why and how. Sara&#8217,s feelings were vividly described in a way that all teenagers could understand. Honestly, her whole point of view was comfortable and I could relate to the way she talked and thought. Plus, I got to see how she changed in mentality as the story progressed.I not only loved the main characters, but also the secondary ones as well. They all had distinct personalities. Brielle was very sharp and rude, Carmichael was insightful, and Dylan was kind and slightly naive. Ah, Carmichael. I absolutely adored his character, so strange and outcast, and yet so lovable and understanding. He was Sara&#8217,s love interest and I only wish I had got more time to spend with him.I still don&#8217,t know whether I liked Emma or not. After all, Sara&#8217,s early perspective had given her a somewhat less appealing version of Emma than the one you grow to know. The first Emma, the boyfriend stealer, sort of spoiled the kind, insecure Emma that killed herself. Because of that, I have mixed feelings about this character, though by the end I was leaning towards liking her.Definitely check out this book if you liked The Perks of Being a Wallflower (and honestly, who didn&#8217,t?). You won&#8217,t regret it. It is also about a troubled teenager, and there are also other similarities that you can&#8217,t overlook &#8212, try it out! I don&#8217,t know about you but I really love the cover, even though it isn&#8217,t that fancy. It&#8217,s so simple and yet conveys a lot of meaning: it has the &#8220,we didn&#8217,t mean to hurt anyone&#8221, that is bolded, the red girlish &#8220,Tease&#8221,, and other details. And the content is just as amazing as I believe the cover to be! This is truly a masterpiece that requires your immediate attention&#8230, buy it as soon as it is released!Notable Scene:But Emma&#8217,s the one who got the last word. She&#8217,ll always be that face, that pretty school photo in the newspaper. And we&#8217,ll always be the monsters who pushed her over the edge.I can talk to Teresa or Natalie or my mom &#8211, well, I can try- but no one really gets it, no one hears me. No one understands how, when Emma went over the edge, she pulled all of us down with her.FTC Advisory: Balzar + Bray/Harper Collins provided me with a copy of Tease.

274883;Wow! I must say to Ms. Cabot that I'm quite impressed! It was written just as a 14 year old girl should write, making it very realistic and a real treat to read.Mia Thermopolis has a pretty normal life. She's no beauty queen, true, and she is flunking Algebra, but she has a loving mother and a fun best friend. Then her father ruins her life by declaring that she's the next ruler of a small European country. Next, her paternal grandmother insists on making her look and act like the crown princess she is, which becomes the cause of a huge fight with her best friend. And now Mia has to battle the media every day at school, and on top of THAT, her mom is dating her Algebra teacher. Whew! Some girls have it tougher than others. But Mia reluctanly clunks her way through it all and comes out (somewhat) victoriously. A cute, breezy read. Five stars.;1
412116;Everyone believes Vee Bell is narcoleptic. Only she knows the truth. When she passes out she actually slides into someone else's mind and experiences the world through their eyes for a few minutes. When she slides into the mind of a murderer, it's a race against time to find the killer and expose the truth.I really enjoyed this book. The idea of sliding into the minds of others is quite different to any other book I've read. Although a lot of the twists caught me off guard, I found Slide quite predictable. The love triangle wasn't needed, it was obvious who she was going to end up with. And the identity of the killer was painfully obvious.This novel touches on some of society's biggest issues such as depression, bullying, rape and death. Each issue is written to work with the overall story, but not deter focus from the main plot, and is done so very well.While Slide was predictable at times, there are twists that are totally unexpected. There are still a lot of unanswered questions that will be addressed in the next book, Impostor. A great start to a new series! I recommend that people give it a go.;1

Kristine's own dating life has left her teary and frustrated, which gives her a chance to see her grandparent's relationship with new eyes. She listens when her Grandma talks about the kind of woman a strong man needs, and how her own marriage required courage and patience.The image Grandma Glo creates is seductively vintage: discreet, feminine women and dapper, strong men.Kristine takes all her Grandma's words to heart, while trying to reconcile them with her modern life. And with the mysterious doctor she dated, then worked for, but who is building a practice in Asia.How to Love an American Man is a charming, wise read that appealed to me, because my Grandmother and Great Aunt were the delicate, feminine wives of dashing men, so I could immediately relate. I could also relate to Kristine's struggle to reconcile that world with the modern world of dating.I absolutely adored & highly recommend. And, I have fingers crossed for a sequel!In retrospect, this book reminds me of Laura Munson's memoir This is Not the Story You Think It Is: A Season of Unlikely Happiness. Just thought I'd add that in, if you want to see how courage & patience might play out in a marriage.;1
73603;&quot,Daughter of Fortune&quot, is the story of a young woman, Eliza Sommers, who grows up in Chile, adopted at birth by a wealthy English spinster and her brother living in Valparaiso during the mid-1800s. She grows up sheltered and naive, and soon her adopted mother devotes herself to finding her an appropriate husband, even though she herself finds marriage too confining. But Eliza has different plans in mind. When her illicit lover takes off to California during the frenetic gold rush days, Eliza runs after him by stowing away in a ship, aided by a young Chinese doctor, Tao Chi'en. Upon arriving in California, she disguises herself as a boy so that she may move about freely as she searches for her lover, and yet all the while she is developing a bond with Tao. Through these adventures, the book tells not only Eliza's story, but the stories of Tao growing up in China and of Eliza's adopted mother, who left England because of her own illicit love affair. It also describes to a lesser extent the lives of several other colorful characters, in Chile and California.I enjoyed this book on many levels. The diverse range of characters were interesting and believable. Through their adventures, Allende brings to life the culture and daily life of Chile, China, and California during the Gold Rush. In the background, the book conveys the constraints imposed on women and foreigners during that time, and how those constraints varied in the different countries described. It showed how much of English social conventions were adopted by the Chileans, which surprised me. Through Tao, the book discusses the differences between Eastern and Western medicine at the time and how distrustful each was of the other's approach (just as they are now). I saw more vividly how extraordinary the California Gold Rush was, not only because of the quick riches (for some), but because it allowed people constrained by class in their homelands to reinvent themselves in ways unimagineable in their own cultures. And yet even in the class-agnostic society of California, still there was a racial pecking order among the immigrants. The book depicted how, after the initial frenzy, those who found ways to provide needed services benefited more than those who struggled to mine what gold was left.While enjoying the rich story line, I also appreciated how perceptive Allende was about people's motivations and the dynamics of relationships. I thought she captured the subtleties of her character's conflicting emotions quite well, and how that drove behavior that at times even the characters themselves didn't always understand. In all, this book was a pleasure to read.;1
171128;Occasionally, I am amazed by my fellow reviewers.  They tend to be articulate, educated, and extremely well read.  They also tend to have intelligent, constructive things to say about even the best of books.  Unfortunately, I am appalled by my fellow readers on this book.To suggest that this novel was not worth the heart wrenching moments is to do an EXTREME disservice to it.  Yes, it is difficult to read.  When you pick up a book that is clearly about teen suicide, did you expect it to be a walk in the park?That aside, I strongly recommend this book, if nothing else but to help you understand a growing population of teens in our world.  Emily, the part of the pact that winds up dead, feels enormous pressure to be perfect and rebounds in an extreme way.  This book gives grand insight into the way that teenagers, especially desperate teenagers, see the world.  In addition, anyone who is reading with an ear for the truth, will learn an important lesson about parenting.  Put too much pressure on your child, even in an obscure way, and it will backfire.The plot is disturbing.  I'm not arguing that.  I am, however, saying that in any dark situation there is something to be learned.  In my experience, the characters presented by Ms. Picoult are frighteningly real and also frighteningly possible.  A walk in the park?  No.Worth it for the characters that you learn to love and the lessons that you hopefully will learn and take to heart?Without a doubt.;1
386397;"In this book, the reader gets two stories for the price of one: First there are gripping tales of high-wire international diplomacy, and then the painful uncovering of close held family secrets.In perhaps her finest diplomatic moment, Ambassador Albright tells us here how she steeled her nerves to ride out the negotiations that would end in a NATO coalition that would root out from Kosovo the petty tyrant and ethnic racist, Slobodan Milosevi'. Almost singlehandedly, she was responsible for pulling together a fractious, and at times a reluctant, NATO coalition, one that would eventually gel into a formidable fighting force that got the job done. This was not the act of a ""shrinking violet,"" or a misguided liberal ideologue, this was the job of a seasoned diplomat, coming into her own.As we see here, Albright's singular most important diplomatic triumph was just one of many that had threads connecting her and the Korbel family to that Central European region that was the home of the Korbel family. Her father, Dr. Josef Korbel, that magnificent and dignified man, who I had the great pleasure to work with at the University of Denver, School of International Studies, an Institute that now bears his name, also spent the early parts of his life and career, literarily dodging the bullets of tyrants like Hitler and Milosevi'. Thus, it is not just parallel and poetic justice that while trying to herd the NATO cats into a wheelbarrow, Ambassador Albright had to recall to her chief aide at the time, Jamie Ruben, the shameful capitulation Chamberlain had made to Adolph Hitler. Our Secretary of State vowed on the spot that the U.S. would not, a half century later, be guilty of another Chamberlain-like crime of capitulating to the likes of Milosevi'. Her involvement in saving Kosovo is a storyline that even the best fiction could not have improved upon. This thread alone, told with candor, surprise and from the vantage point of a diplomat who understood her moment in history, and steadfastly stood her ground, is alone worth the price of the book.Like her father, Ambassador Albright is no false ideological prophet, she understands that international politics is a game that fits into the genre of the hardest of hard ball. And following her father's lead, she learned the game the old fashion way and played it with the best of her generation. And she did it not just to posture and impress others, as others in her position have done, but to win, and she won repeatedly.As for her private life, and the way it intersected with her profession and her outlook on life, I am reminded of the adage that all families are dysfunctional, just dysfunctional in their own way. This adage surely applies as much to the Korbel/Albright family as it does to the rest of us. Thus, I believe deep inside she felt more than just slightly betrayed that her parents and family members protected her from the important knowledge about her Jewish heritage. But much like her father, she is much too dignified to hold family grudges, or to cast blame for her lack of knowledge. And anyway, she has attacked the problem of family discovery with the same zeal and commitment to the truth as she did with any other project. And as a result, the reader gets a double feature: He is taken on a bifurcated journey into yet another story, one that is at least as interesting as that involving her professional career in international diplomacy.I recognize that it may be colossally unfair to compare the biographies of living statesmen. However since I worked for (and in the instance of Ambassador Albright, also worked with) them, the comparison, fair or not, emerges somewhat unforced. As a 27-year career State Department Foreign Affairs Officer, I had the good fortune to have worked for all of the Secretaries of State from Henry Kissinger through Condoleeza Rice. I have also read the biographies of all of them except that of George Shultz's. And without reservation, I can say that Ambassador Albright's is not just the very best -- the best written, but also it ties with General Colin Powell's for also being the most honest of them.Kissinger's, predictably, and as anyone who has read anything by him can attest, was simply a bit too pompous and self-servicing, often to the point of being off-putting. Plus, the writing was stilted perfectly in keeping with everything else we know about Mr. Kissinger. Rice's biography, like her tenure as Secretary of State, in my humble opinion, simply did not rise to the same level as the others. Her book struck me much too defensive (as well as others who reviewed it) and simply was not a very serious writing project. Whether under deadline or psychological pressures, her biography simpler never came together - and in any case, revealed little that we could not have been gleaned from the newspapers. As well, as I said in my Amazon review of her book, I found so many instances where she had either been willfully dishonest, or failed to take any responsibility for her bad decisions while serving in important posts in the U.S. government, especially in her position at the NSC, and including her tenure as Secretary of State. Her lack of candor and commitment to her own book project was telling and came through at every turn, making reading it a rather painful exercise.  I have seen good reviews of Rice's more recent book, but because the first one burnt me so badly, I am gun-shy about getting bitten a second time.Not so in Ambassador Albright's two books covering her life and her career. In my view this is the better of her two books and is the gold standard for biographies of American Statesmen. I believe this is so because Ambassador Albright has been motivated first by her own personal attempt to get at the truth of history and at the same time get at the truth of her own family's trek from tyranny to freedom. Thus it is clear that here she is on a quest for the unanswered questions about the history of her family, and then about the truth about her mother country.The intensity with which she pursues that quest comes through here and we, the reader, are the beneficiaries of it. We are taken along for the ride. And what an interesting ride, it is. Not only a great researcher into her family tree, she is also a great storyteller. Ambassador Albright can be proud of this book, and so too can her girls.  If she writes another book, I'll be the first in line to get it. And this time I will not miss her book signing. Easily five stars.";1
486568;Young love. It never seems to proceed without complications, does it?In Wait For You, J. Lynn introduced us to Avery and Cam, a couple whose relationship began on a rather torturous note. Avery had suffered some personal horrors that led her to Shepherdstown, West Virginia (where she can be WATCHED OVER by SHEPHERDS), and, eventually, the arms of the hot dude living across the hall from her.That would be Cam.We also met, albeit a tad tangentially, Cam's BFF Jase Winstead. Who, much like Cam, is quite hot. And while we never met Cam's sister Teresa, we heard about her through Cam, who'd gotten himself into a bit of a scuffle where Teresa and her ex-boyfriend were concerned.So now, with Be With Me, we get to spend time getting to know Teresa and Jase.Much like Cam and Avery, this romance will not take off without numerous hitches, each of them related to Issues that our hero and heroine have.Teresa (or, as Jase - but only Jase - calls her, Tess) is struggling to recovery from ACL surgery that threatens to end her dancing career. (Avery was a dancer, too.) She's decided to come to Shepherdstown for her first college semester (SO SHE CAN BE WATCHED OVER BY A SHEPHERD), just long enough to get the knee back under control and then head to New York to resume her dancing career.And, perhaps, the thought of seeing Jase on a regular basis might have factored into her decision just a wee tad.See, about a year prior, Tess and Jase shared a hot smooch, and she would like more. But Jase? Well, that hunka hunka burnin' love hasn't exactly been Mr. Correspondence since. In fact, the two have exchanged nary a word.But now they are back in each other's orbits, and it appears that Jase might be interested. At least certain parts of his body are interested. VERY INTERESTED.Alas, just being interested isn't going to seal the deal for these two. First they need to come to terms with Jase's current personal situation (which is broadcast about as loudly as you can imagine, yet nonetheless seems to surprise Tess), as well as Tess's wonky knee. Oh, and there is also Tess's roommate, who may or may not be getting abused by her boyfriend, which serves as a sort of trigger for Tess because she knows what it's like to be abused.As silly as this plot sounds - and I realize, as I type, that it sounds silly - the book, nonetheless, is entertaining and good. Tess is feisty and headstrong, but she's also a girl in love with a boy who captured her heart several years earlier, and who happens to be her brother's best friend. She is desperate to connect with him, but every time she does, his immediate reaction is to tell her he's sorry it happened. Is it any wonder he confuses her?One thing Tess knows for certain is that she cares deeply for Jase, and she wants to be with him. If only his intentions were as clear.While this is a fairly standard YA plot, it distinguishes itself as NA because of the headboard rockin'.There IS some hot headboard rockin'. More than in Wait for You, which gave us blue boobs waiting for Cam and Avery to shuck their clothes and get after it. Little sister Tess just needs a brewski or fourski and she is read to gooooooo.I got into the story, largely because I always get emotionally attached to female characters who suffer from unrequited love. When Jase tells Tess that he made a mistake - and he does this more than once - I might have teared up. In fact, a big fat tear might have rolled down my cheek. Maybe even more than one.The hot headboard rockin' is nicely done. Detailed, but not graphic. Let's just say that your boobs won't be too blue after reading this one.Yes, it's a bit overly dramatic and hyperbolic at times, and, yes, it is predictable. But it still feels real. You can imagine these situations unfolding in a college dorm room somewhere. It isn't as if one of Tess's classmates turns into a vampire or anything.Then again, we do meet Calla, and she does have a strange scar on her face. So I guess anything is possible in the third installment.Published on cupcake's book cupboard@VivaAmaRisata;1
150505;I started reading this series because a friend raved about it. I found the book kind of hard to get into.  I kept pushing myself thinking it has to get better. I found myself not liking the main character so well. How could a 200 yr old vampire be that clueless? Really? I spotted the plot right away, and I usually don't do that! How she lived that long is a wonder to me. She even mentioned it herself.This is the first book I read. I will reserve judgement and read the second. I've been told that I give up too easily sometimes. I almost made that mistake with Janet Evanovich. Hopefully, this series will get better too.;1

The thing that drove me crazy throughout this book (at least the Kindle version) was the terrible editing! Mistakes ranged from misspelling witness names (Amy Huizenger instead of Amy Huizenga) to getting dates wrong! Ugh. The most annoying mistakes were the trial dates: The editor stated the trial started on Tuesday, 23 May 2011. WRONG! It started on Tuesday, 24 May 2011. Perhaps I'm being nit-picky, but it's simple mistakes like those that can make the author look careless. Someone please fire the editor and republish the corrected book!;1
58939;"A young boy with a mysterious past and strange powers, with a plucky sidekick and evil forces that want him dead. Harry Potter? Nope, it's the teenage hero of the new dark fantasy ""Ravenscliff Series."" Geoffrey Huntington weaves together gothic elements with an intriguingly murky plot about evil ghosts, disguised demons, and a budding sorcerer that teens will love.Devon March is not like other boys: He hears voices, can move and affect things with his mind, and the things that go bump in his closet are for real. Ever since he was little, he has been pursued by demons which his father always assured him he was stronger than them. But when his father dies, revealing that Devon is adopted, he is sent to live with the weird Muir family in their rambling seaside mansion of Ravenscliff. There is the cold Mrs. Crandall, her energetic daughter Cecily, and mischievous nephew Alexander, not to mention the creepy caretaker Simon and charming, secretive competitor Rolfe Montaigne (great name!).And Devon's problems only get worse. Demons begin to up their attacks on him and those around him, and he starts to suspect that the precocious Alexander may not be merely mischievous, or even destructive -- he may be the conduit for a vengeful presence seeking to release demons from the Hellhole. To battle the evil forces in his new home, Devon will learn his true nature as a sorcerer, and may find the keys to his past.Really good dark fantasy (or fantastic horror, or whatever) is a very rare thing because the authors usually just throw one shock after another at the readers. Huntington, on the other hand, utilizes gothic cliches (the sinister mansion with a tragic past, abandoned towers with lights, the weird caretaker) with the excellent idea of the Sorcerers of the Nightwing. Despite using a combination of stuff that could have been stupid if handled badly (demons in the closet, evil clown-face), and stuff that has been done many times before (gothic cliches), nothing Huntington does seems stale or affected. If anything, the gothic atmosphere is better because Huntington takes the old cliches and remakes them, rather than shying away from them.He also handles Devon March very well, almost all of the book is seen through Devon's eyes, and so we have a good idea of his fears and thoughts. If readers want someone deeper than Harry Potter, then Devon may be the right hero. Cecily seems like a less chattery Lloyd Alexander heroine, while Alexander reeks with innocent-faced creepiness. Readers may especially like Rolfe, at first it seems hard to tell what side he's on, but he's intriguing right from the start.His writing style is fairly descriptive, mainly when it needs to be (no intricate descriptions of pizza parlors). But when describing the grotesque and the weird, such as a maimed ghost, he doesn't try to shock us. He also has a good sense of how to build up tension and suspense with little hints of the horrific, rather than flying blood and body bits, the plot twists and past events are well-drawn and evocative. The dialogue is also very good, especially anything uttered by the villain (""Can you spell it, boys and girls? W-R-O-N-G!"").Teenagers and adults will definitely enjoy the opener of this series, especially those with a love of ghoulies, ghosties, long-leggedy-beasties, and sorcerers who make books fly through the air. Can't wait for the second ""Ravenscliff"" book.";1

438811;I like this authors writing.  Really pulls u into her stories. It was a good read excellent writing skills. But I didn't love the story don't get me we rob it's just my take in it I enjoys romance more there was more fighting but it was written really well.;1
581216;It's little wonder that actor Robert Redford, when he forayed into the field of directing, selected author Judith Guest's novel about a family headed for oblivion as his freshman project. &quot,Ordinary People,&quot, the film, starred, of course, Mary Tyler Moore and Donald Sutherland as the parents of two sons, the older of whom drowns in a boating accident and the younger who survives with the agonizing guilt for living, perhaps to the emotional rejection of his mother. But before the film won 1980's Best Picture Oscar and Redford a Best Director statue, there was the novel, and author Guest's treatment of a family headed for destruction is both excrutiating but magnificently honest in its feelings that she gives her characters. Unlike the film, though, the book closes with some glimmer of hope for at least one of the three members of a family whose self-implosion is feared but can't be avoided. But like the film, Guest doesn't cheat us in her novel by insulting us with a everyone-lives-happily-ever-after absolution. On the contrary, no one leaves a family structure that has collapsed and heads for a happily-ever-after destiny. That's not how it usually works in the real world, and Guest doesn't insult our intelligence by giving her fictional family a happy ending. &quot,Ordinary People,&quot, the book, remains an accurate and honest look at a family falling apart at the seams, and it was the foundation of a film as equally powerful.;1
634913;Ruhlman divides his work into 3 parts.  The first part chronicles the intense Certified Master Chef exam.  The second and third parts deal with the lives and cooking of Michael Symon of Lola in Cleveland and Thomas Keller of the French Laundry in Yountville, CA.  The book's title pretty much says it all.  The chefs portrayed in this book strive for nothing less than perfection, and Symon and Keller have apparently reached that level with some of their creations.  Ruhlman's description of the CMC exam reveals what an intense and harrowing experience this test of cooking skill is.  He follows seven candidates through ten days of the examination which everyone fails but one.  He then proceeds to describe the work of Symon and Keller.  Both chefs' stories are inspirational in that they prove that success has as much to do with dedication and diligence as innate talent.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand not only what it takes to be a great chef but what it takes to be successful in any profession.  The only difficulty I had with this book was that I did not understand many of the cooking and food terms the author used.  A glossary would have been nice.  Anyway, a great read!;1
294450;The bare bones of the plotline: a late 20's woman, Lillian, is being stalked by a thug/cretin, Blackway, in a small logging village in a thinly populated area soomewhere in New England. Castle Freeman weaves two storylines and entertains the reader with the stark facts of Lilian's attempt to track down Blackway with the assistance of the young and not very bright Nate the Great and Lester an aging but resourceful loggerman. Interspersed with this account, four men sit in Whizzer's Office of the Dead River Chair Company recalling incidents and events in the history of the place and provide insights into the circumstances behind Blackway's reasons for terrorising Lillian. The story is wonderfully paced and the dialogue of the four men had me chuckling aloud. It is a contemporary story but resonates of the red neck and bigoted Americans who live in isolated communities. It also raises the question as to who is responsible for law and order. A short easy to read novel but not without both humour and punch.;1
440794;This is a story of remarkable determination and dedication of our military heroes who were determined to leave no one behind! The stories of brave members of our military during that period in our history just fantastic! Then the determination of those who years later wanted to return those that were lost to their families just heartwarming. Excellent read!;1
61154;Gardner is becoming one of my favorite authors, and i don't know how I'd overlooked him for years! I've read all his novels now, and was thrilled to find this book of short stories... and it lived up to my expectations.All the stories were very well-written, though obviously some appealed to me more than others. None disappointed me, though. He's a thoughtful writer more than one who does action-packed, and I appreciate that- especially in sf.I have only one small quibble: I would have preferred the forwards to the stories to be right before the stories, rather than stuck in the preface, they added a lot to the stories, and it was rather a nuisance to have to poke around to find them.;1
172770;Story:Next is set in the fast paced world of genetic engineering. Where tomorrow someone may own the gene that gives people blue eyes and our pets may be living bill boards. The story is broken up into three parts (the story bounces between them)that illustrate how, in the extreme if bio genectics  is allowed to run amok, it could change our world for the worse. The first is the case of Mr. Frank Burnett, he has the unfortunate case of having cells that combat cancer. His doctor discovered this,but didn't tell burnett. The doctor proceeded to make a lot of money with his discovery. When Burnett sues to get his part of the money, he loses to a technicality. Now Burnett and his family are living cell factories whether they want to be or not.. The second is Mr.Kendall, he was working as research scientist when he decided to see what would happen if he combined his dna with the dna of a chimp. The creature was never souppsed to be born but it was, now Mr. Kendall is torn between letting the creature live and removing something that shouldn't exist. The third case is of Josh, another researcher working on a maturity gene, he accidentaly doses his brother, his brother is a drug addict who thought he could get high off somthing he finds in Josh's car, and his brother becomes a responsible productive adult almost overnight. Unfortunatley as time goes on it is found the drug has certain side effects..----This book is about what happens when no one is paying attention and by the time they do start paying attention what can go wrong. There are some interesting facts in this book about bio technology and what can be done with it. There is also the cautionary tale about what could happen if the patent system and some of the laws are left as they are. This isnt a bad book and for the most part satisfies the long afternoon read, it keeps the pages turning. But it does focus mainly on paranoia, so some of the story is a stretch. But other than that it is a good, fast paced read.;1
610308;I have to admit I didn't hold out too much hope of finishing this book  about a hundred pages in. It had been given to me as a gift, and having  never read Roddy Doyle before I was anxious to see what all the fuss was  about. The premise sounded promising enough, A young boy in Ireland who  grows up to become an I.R.A. terrorist. The book is broken into four  sections beginning with his impoverished childhood that could be gleaned  directly from the world of Frank McCourt, to his young retirement at the  battered and weary age of twenty. Where the book almost lost me was his  bloody recounting of the 1916 Easter Day Massacre. This section of the book  starts literally with a bang in an almost cinematic vision of gore, glass,  bullets, and frightened young men. Not being a history buff, and especially  not European History, I was confused at what was suddenly going on without  the benefit of a third person narrative to shed some light on the incidents  at hand.Luckily, the story snapped back into for me what became a  comprehensive progression as he grew up and continued into a violent  political destiny. Doyles' characters such as Miss Dolly Oblong, the Madame  of a brothel where Henry's father works, seem inspired by the world of  Dickens for their richness of character existing in the underbelly of the  city.I was glad I stuck with it. It's made me want to learn more about the  I.R.A., and about that period in history. That's a testament to the writer  and his Henry.;1
111530;I really enjoyed the beginning of this book.  The leading man was dark and dangerous and the lady smart and strong.  I found the time travel to modern day and the references to modern technology and the use of modern slang to be extremely annoying and completely unnecessary.  The story is set in a fantasy world, why travel to the 21st century?  Then there's the ending.  The story completely wimped out.  Poof, invoke a magical solution and they lived happily every after.  It killed the whole book for me.;1
371002;A Need So Beautiful is one of the best YA books I have ever read. Asking me to explain why apparently turns my brain to mush and nothing coherent will follow. However I must try to explain my utter love for this book so that you dear reader can experience it for yourself.The plot isn't unique, it is the formula that works on me. Boy, girl, wise guiding old person. However the supernatural element is completely unique. Charlotte is a Forgotten. She feels a pull towards people to help them and each time she helps she is losing a part of her self. The ultimate sacrifice is that she will die, but Charlotte doesn't want to die so she may have to align herself with the beautiful woman in her dreams who promises her immortality on earth.The writing is sweet and sticky. You cling to the words long after you finish reading the story. The love story is beautiful, the best friend's story is tragic, Charlotte is smart and funny and a reluctant hero all in one. I really can't explain how emotionally stirring the book is, so you will just have to try it for yourself when it comes out on the 21st.All I can say coherently is that I loved A NEED SO BEAUTIFUL and am dying to read A WANT SO WICKED.;1
352536;"The concept here is brilliant, if unashamedly derivative. The execution is abysmal. The book changes in tense between past perfect (he had gone), past (he went), and present (the zombie stands) for no clear reason. We get sentences that tell us nothing such as ""And then he heard it."" The next sentence describes what he heard.  There are a lot of these, and removing them would have tightened the writing and made the story flow better. We get elements where the most dramatic elements are saved until the end, then put in their own paragraph. We find out that there are a lot of rats, that the one in front is huge, and oh by the way, it has two heads.  These are aspects of technique, but they are prominent through the piece, and they detract greatly from the novel.I could not understand why the characters acted and reacted the way they did much of the time. They're flat and serve only to forward the plot, which would have been wonderful, were it executed properly.";1
507702;I'm surprised at all the negative comments on this book.  I thought it was very entertaining and funny.  A really good read.;1
514917;I got this book when I was having my 11 year old niece and her friend over for a few days in the summer.  There are lots of ideas broken down by types of game (indoor, outdoor, chase, water etc.) and in the glossarie, you can also find games for a certain age group, or for a certain number of kids.  It's a little old school, and reminds you of things you did when you were growing up, and exposes you to so much more.  This is a truly great book if you find yourself having to entertain kids (or start them on something and let them entertain themselves).  Wonderful if you want yoru kids to be doing something besides playing video games or watching t.v.;1

158886;John Grogan's book was given to my husband and I as a gag gift for Christmas because our entire family thinks that we have the world's worst dog.  After reading Marley and Me, I feel infinitely better about my impossible pooch who has certainly engaged in her own Marley-style antics - eg, eating a cashmere sweater or jumping into the car of a total stranger when she broke out of the house one day.  What I did not expect from this book was to see how inextricable pets become from the passing of time in a family.  Grogan's writing style is witty and easy, funny without effort.  It is a good read even for people who hate to read.  He is able to recreate the world according to Marley so vividly that I felt I was there every time that dog tried to break out of their garage that Grogan loving calls the concrete bunker.  Marley and me reminded me that dogs, though not human, can give unconditional love that you can get nowhere else depsite all of their mental insanity.;1

293228;DESTINED, by Aprilynne Pike, is the final book in the Wings series. Goodness there is so much I want to say about this book but most of it will spoil the ending. I can't tell you if I loved or hated the end because then you will know who Laurel chooses (If you don't know already, I am 100% Team Tamani). I am going to navigate this review very delicately so bear with me.I have been waiting to get this book in my hands since I finished the jaw-dropping end of Illusions. Yuki turned out to be something I never expected but yet I was curious about her. Tamani, Laurel, Shar, David, and Chelsea were trying to get information from Yuki to no avail. Klea turned out to be the bad baddy, a very dangerous one at that. This book starts off where Illusions ended so I was ready to delve in right away.After the first chapter, this book was non-stop action. And Tamani, Laurel, David, and Chelsea found themselves in the thick of it. Klea's plan to destroy Avalon left these four no choice but to return to Avalon to warn the fey. Klea and her army of trolls were always nipping at their heels and the fights that ensued were bloody and horrific. Pike did an AMAZING job writing the action scenes. I felt that I was right in the thick of the action and my heart pounded each time one of the main character's was close to getting hurt (or did in some cases).Pike had built up to this moment throughout all the books and I find myself wanting to re-read them all in order to experience it again. Klea's plans were present throughout the series and I was completely duped. Even though Klea was not a good character, I found myself very interested in her background and how she became that way.There were small moments of swoon-worthy romance between Tamani and Laurel that I cherished. But a majority of the book was them fighting for Avalon and their lives. No character was safe in this book but I felt that it made their situation more real and made me read the book that much faster to see who would survive!I will not say if I liked the ending...but I liked how Pike left part of it open so that (hopefully!) in the future she could return to write more books about my favorite characters! Also, when the book ended there was a little Afterword from Pike giving the ending to the series the way she wanted to. I didn't know if I would like it, but I wished she would have made it the actual ending. It was bittersweet but with the preface of creating a story about what a human would do if they found out about magic I thought it was perfect.Cover note: I loved all the covers in the series, but this one is my favorite. I love the colors and lighting of the flower very much!;1
170548;I started reading this book for my book club and before I started it, I was sure it would be one of those books I would struggle with and never finish.  China has never been high on my list of interests, I've always been fairly apathetic about Asian history.  But Peter Hesslers storytelling swept me up and managed to keep me engrossed enough not to want to put the book down.  It also peaked an interest for me in the culture of another huge country on the other side of the world from me.  I think it is a huge gift for a writer to open a reader's eyes to a new interest.;1
164310;Loved the book, it explains how psychpathic personalities can easily get passed interviews with impressive results. How they can dress up their resume and work experience, and how they create divisions and foster conflict within the organization.If you've ever worked somewhere and wondered just how a deceitful, manipulative, and arrogant coworker or boss succeeded in keeping his job, this book is for you. It's also a great read for anyone new to the work world, or just out of college.It gives you the knowledge required to identify and protect yourself before you get burned by these remorseless and conscienceless individuals. Highly Reccomended!;1

526557;The author writes very well about subject matter that is inherently confusing and highly technical.  He manages to guide you through how most important aspects of computer hardware / OS work.  He does so in a clear and easy-to-understand method.This book is the one book I would suggest to any person who wants to know more about computers and is considering IT as a career.  IT starts with A+ (lame pun intended).Forget the long winded reviews that say bad things about this book.  If you can read, and you have even the slightest bit of a technical aptitude, then you will have no problem passing the test using this book.  Just make sure you get the latest addition.Well done Mr. Meyers.;1
173874;I think the plot and the storyline was well developed and the idea of a lost Shakespeare manuscript great.  However, the characters annoyed me.  Every character was so much to the extreme: three siblings, one a gorgeous blond model, the other a former heavyweight Olympian-turned lawyer, and the third a former prison thug-turned Jesuit priest.  Not to mention the Nazi mom and Jewish dad.  The other characters were similary extremists and I thought it was not believable the way every character was written so exceptionally.  Other than that, good plot, though a little too much diversion into the main character's sex life and various other musings.;1
409032;No one writes wonderful stories like Agatha Christie.  Story holds your attention through the whole novel, characters are completely believable.  Enjoyed the book as much today as I did when I was a kid.;1

108894;This is clearly not Lashner's best work.  It took a while to get thorough, but Lashner kept me interested.  This is a book that cries out for better editing.  Way too many long descriptive passages that lead to yawns.  The story is convoluted, but at least the main plot is interesting--just who is the evil force behind the Pickle family?  And Carl is so darned interesting.  I love Morris as always.  I noticed that this book was called Vertias first and there was almost a 6 year lag between novels for our boy Lashner...I hope that Fatal Flaw is better.  Still, because I love Philadelphia (Lasher even gets the restaurants right here) and Carl, I will read it.;1

456414;"Scorpion Deception is the next installment in the bestselling Scorpion spy thriller series by Andrew Kaplan. This talented author is known for being one of the writers of the James Bond classic, ""Goldeneye"" and other Spy Stories & Tales of Intrigue. A former journalist and war correspondent, his writing takes on a concise, efficient tone that quickly grabs your attention and holds on to it to the end. This 421-page novel is the 3rd in the series. It continues the saga of Scorpion, a classic spy hero involved in an action-packed, heart pounding thriller that spans the globe, taking readers into exotic corners of the world from Africa to Switzerland to Iran. Kaplan has created a world and familiar characters. Along with his ability to describe fast-paced action scenes with exciting detail, readers who enjoy classic spy or action thrillers will love this series.I loved Kaplan's earlier Scorpion novels. I don't know if the premise is wearing thin or if the writing seems somewhat forced now, but this installment is not as good. That doesn't mean it rates &lt,4 stars, but it does mean that I hope his story-telling improves. With 3 Scorpion novels released in 14 months, I have similar love-hate feelings about other favorite authors who fast-track serials. What began as a great action thriller, borders on another well-worn story-line with a Bond-ish bad guy named ""the Gardner"" vs. familiar protagonist, Scorpion, an ex-government operative turned reluctant freelance superspy. As for Deception, for me at least, it's like an addiction. I know the worn out tropes are bad for me, but I just can't seem to stop reading. Kaplan does a great job writing action scenes and the way he weaves suspense into the plot is why this series is at the top of the charts.I am a sucker for stories like this sometimes. It is a nice diversion, one that lets me enjoy a story about a superspy who goes after a bad guy whose trying to blow up the world. Like mind candy.";1
165520;Wow.  I loved this book.  It was as implausible and fairy-tale-like as can be, a total, romantic hot fudge sundae withnuts, cherries and opera on top, but who the heck cares?It was divine to meander through.  I felt like a child in astrange and beautiful garden, and when finally the bookended (alas! even I did not want the 'siege' to be over) I wept, because the ending itself was so absolutely perfect.  When you thought about it later, you had to admit that there could not be any other finis.  Sigh.;1
64931;This 1925 novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, set in the year 1922, is a literary classic and I can well understand why.  A mere 205 pages, it's a book that has everything - story, theme, symbolism, moral drama and great characters.  No wonder it's stood the test of time.The early 1920s was a very special time in American history.  The Great War was over, and it was a time of celebration.  Prohibition was the law of the land and bootleggers and gamblers were making fortunes as everybody partied with illegal booze and speculated in the stock market.  In retrospect, we readers know that it all came to a crashing end later, but that was after the book was published and so the book captures the era in its own time.The narrator is Nick Carraway, a young man who, like Fitzgerald himself, was raised in the mid-west and is working in the stock market in New York City.  His own financial circumstances are modest but he rents a house in Long Island next door to the flamboyant and wealthy Jay Gatsby, who throws lavish parties and whose background is shrouded in mystery.  As a New Yorker myself I must say I cringed at his geography, but the rest of the book transcends these minor physical details.Slowly, we learn of Jay Gatsby's obsessive love for the wealthy Daisy, now married to the snobbish Tom Buchanan who is having an affair with a garage owner's wife.  Nick is a friend of this cast of characters, participating in their lives but yet standing back and observing.  He's a man of his times as well as a person who understands human character and foibles.  How the story plays out is a complex drama filled with passion and tragedy and including elements worthy of Shakespeare or classic Greek theater.  This is more than just a good story.  It's an emotional ride in expensive cars to an era filled with people we can all identify with.I give this book by highest recommendation.  It rises above a mere good read and dwells in the realm of great literature.;1
272693;Serena, first introduced as a short story, is a gripping novel set in North Carolina during the depression.  I'm familiar with logging history of the Pacific Northwest and find myself cringing at how logging was handled in Appalachia in the 20's.But this is not a story about logging.  Rash has crafted a tale about people who seem very real.  Pemberton is a wealthy timber baron whose obsession with Serena's beauty makes him blind to her lack of a soul.  Serena is way ahead of her time--she does not ride her horse side saddle, thank you very much.  She will not let anything or anyone stand in the way of her lust for power.  She set her sights on Pemberton from the moment she saw him, but it wasn't love she was feeling.  Serena has no capacity for love.  There is something in her past that is hinted at, but never detailed that made me wonder: did this dark incident in her past make her so cold and unfeeling, or did she bring it about herself?  The eagle she buys and trains is symbolic of Serena, and I imagine them sharing the same cold, unflinching eyes.I enjoyed the backdrop of the logging business itself and the political fight for the creation of National Parks.When I see a logging truck go by, those logs appear as dead bodies to me, so you can imagine which side of this fight I would have found myself on.  There was money in those trees, and for people like Serena clearcutting the entire Appalachian Range would not have been enough.There are many minor characters in this novel as well.  All are interesting and even the most minor characters seem true.  Rachel, the young mother of Pemberton's illegitimate son grows stronger with each passing day and her love for her son drives her to protect him any way she can.My only complaint would be that some elements seem somewhat out of place for that era.  I won't go into the details of what bothered me specifically because they aren't enough to spoil the enjoyment of this fine novel.  A little editing and this might get 5 stars from me.Well written, engaging, with a hugely satisfying end.  Highly recommended.;1
581806;I  read this book for an upcoming book group. We were looking for a scary story since we will meet a couple days before Halloween.  Some of the aspects of the book were quite unsettling especially the very creepy closing doorsand the housekeeper.  I got the impression that she knows more than she lets on about the house and the goings on in the house.  Having said this I definitely do see where we will have a very lively discussion in deed espeically with the character development.;1
338512;I was extremely disappointed in this book.  The title caused me to believe that it was going to address Sarah Palin's actual going rogue in regard to politics.  After reading the first 3 chapters that were more of a bio on her and her personal life throughout the years I became bored with it.  I personally wanted to read about what she is doing in the arena of politics since &#34,Going Rogue&#34,.  The book probably got around to it towards the end but I bored with it early on.  I put it down and never picked it up again.  After thumbing through it to see when I would reach any part that addressed my interest I became disappointed in it.  Before purchasing it, I would encourage any potential buyer to run their cursor across the book & pick out certain pages to read beforehand.;1
30446;"Divided into 88 segments, mostly short, this book opens with an episode in which Joyce finds an abusive note on the windscreen of her car, complaining of her parking. In the next segment, she and husband Ray are involved in a serious motor accident that could easily have been fatal, but the injuries they sustain are mostly inflicted only by the explosively inflating airbags. In segment three, Joyce takes Ray to the Emergency Room of the Princeton Medical Center, where he is found to have E.coli pneumonia. In segment fourteen, he dies.Much of what happens before Ray dies is a waking nightmare. But for Joyce matters are not yet done with moving from bad to worse, the nightmare still has a long way to run.Clearing the hospital room of Ray's belongings, selecting and visiting an undertaker and buying a burial plot are still not the worst of it. Joyce calls the phase immediately following the death 'pre-widowhood', when the widow hasn't yet got it - what it will mean to inhabit a free-fall world from which meaning has been drained. Beyond that is the 'post-humus life' - life after Ray - which for months to come is worse yet, worst of all.We know Joyce will eventually be OK when she responds to a floral tribute that warns ""Important: decorative plant mosses should not be eaten"" with 'A widow may be deranged, but a widow is not that deranged.' Nevertheless, for several months both present and future appear utterly bleak.She develops various coping mechanisms, such as 'each day is livable if divided into segments - Morning-Afternoon I-Afternoon II-Evening-Night'.  Afternoons and evenings are often helped along by teaching and public reading engagements, where she 'impersonates' Joyce Carol Oates, as distinct from being herself, the widow Joyce Smith. At night, too often sleepless, her thoughts turn suicidal. She reflects objectively on the attractions of suicide, but when she quotes Nietzsche, ""The thought of suicide is a strong consolation, one can get through many a bad night with it"", we are again reassured, neither her balance nor her sense of irony have been lost.As the outlook slowly improves, the memoir becomes all that we had dared hope of an author who is as articulate, eloquent and distinctive as Joyce Carol Oates. We learn much of Joyce and Ray's courtship, their long and happy marriage, their families and careers. There are reflections on teaching, on writing, on editing (Ray's forte) and, just occasionally, a view on university politics or America as it was and has become. Some of the names dropped are well-known authors, and there is clearly much affection and mutual support within that world. Some condolences and well-intended words of encouragement are crass, but the best are very helpful indeed and, like many of Joyce's own observations, will be noted by the precautious reader for possible future application.Ultimately, Joyce's message is that whilst widowhood is not a condition in any way to be desired, it is survivable. Besides being an excellent read, this valuable book is full of possible aids to that survival. 'On the first anniversary of the husband's death, the widow should think ""I kept myself alive.""'";1
443376;Y'all, I freaking adored Sarah Strohmeyer's YA debut Smart Girls Get What They Want, and I was very excited to get my hands on her next YA effort, also given a super long title. What I wanted from How Zoe Made Her Dreams (Mostly) Come True (henceforth to be called How Zoe because my fingers are tired) was a light, funny read to combat all the science fiction and dystopian books I've been reading. How Zoe was the perfect little palate cleanser, and just what I needed to read at this moment.How Zoe is super cutesy. Like, cutesy to the power of kittens dressed up like princesses, okay? It is not, however, set in the 80s and does not involve cotton candy, as the cover seems to suggest. The mood is light-hearted and Strohmeyer's goal is to make the reader laugh and smile. At this point in my reading, I really wanted something sweet and funny, and How Zoe fit the bill perfectly.How Zoe takes place at a fairy tale-themed theme park, Fairyland. Zoe and her cousin (and best friend), Jess, have gotten coveted internships to work in the park over the summer with 38 other teens. Two of the interns, one male and one female, will win $25,000 dollar scholarships at the end of the summer for being the best of the best and showing that Wow! spirit. Both Jess and Zoe could really use that money, since Jess' parents lost their jobs and have already used up her college fund, and Zoe's family is strapped for money due to her late mother's medical fees.Fairyland serves as the perfect set up for romantic drama, because it's 40 attractive kids away from home for the summer. Plus, there's mystery and backstabbing and general rule-breaking. Yes, it's a bit silly, but that's totally the point. How Zoe is a great readalike for Strohm's Pilgrims Don't Wear Pink or Sales' Past Perfect, both of which take place at historical reenactment towns, and, personally, it's my favorite of the three.What I like best about Strohmeyer's YA novels is that, though romance is a big part of them, she doesn't spend all of her time on that. She really highlights the importance of female friendships and of reconsidering first impressions. Though Jess and Zoe don't get to spend too much time together through the course of the book, because Zoe's role keeps her so busy, Zoe always keeps Jess' well-being in her thoughts. Never at any point does Zoe resent Jess for being the princess-type, while she's not. Jess and Zoe are totally supportive of one another at every turn, and it's so great to see healthy female friendships in YA.My only real complain with How Zoe is the ending. The last chapter feels rushed and infodumps a ton of information on the reader. What could have been a cool twist ends up feeling way too neat and rushed. Plus, the whole resolution seems a bit unlikely, even in the context of the story. Why would Zoe have specifically been chosen for this? How could it have been in play the whole time and what if it fell through? Both the conclusion and the romance, while decent, would have been much more satisfying with a bit more time put into them.Even more than in Smart Girls, How Zoe is a fluff book. If you're looking for something with a dark center or deep themes, How Zoe is not going to be your book. However, if you're looking for a fast-paced read full of heart and humor, you can't go wrong with Sarah Strohmeyer's YA novels. I know all of her future YA efforts will continue to end up on my to-read list!;1
576512;I read this book today only because there was a documentary about J.D. Salinger on Netflix which I watched. What in the hell classifies this as a masterpiece???? It was nothing but boring drivel, about a pompous obnoxious spoiled little rich kid who hates school and everyone in his life but his little sister, his writer-brother and his dead brother. I kept reading to find anything interesting on the pages, it was just monotonous...Obviously, Salinger thought his IQ was too high for anyone else around him, yet, there was no plot, no suspense, no activity really, just his malingering thoughts about everything and everyone. It was a complete WASTE OF MY TIME!!! I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, unless you want to be bored out of your mind....which I certainly was....Kelly CyrAuthor of &#34,Supreme Love: A Battered Woman's True Story&#34,;1

613297;As is often the case, this sequel was not quite as charming as the first book.  However, it did have one advantage over the original: no one has made it into a movie, so I didn&#8217,t know the story beforehand. Miss Porter chose to gloss over a number of years of Pollyanna's life, which is too bad, and the conclusion was pretty obvious.  However, this novel is not about plot, it's about the characters.

You'll also get battles, magic, plotting, adventures, horror, and more,-Unique takes on magic - it is nice to have different world with a different outlook on magic, with necromancy being the big element of the series,Abhorsen makes a satisfying conclusion: this has a grander scale, more characters to enjoy and overall is a great finish to the story.;1
463349;I just really did not like this book at all. The premise was pretty incredible, and the it had great reviews so maybe it is just me, but I struggled to even finish it.

I found the characters unlikeable, and the ending was just plain depressing. Definitely not a book I'll be recommending.;1

194315;I thought this book was terrible. I read all the reviews and was ready for a great read. I knew that Jiles was a poet and this was her first novel but knowing that didn't help. The story was too pat, everything conviently turned up right when it was supposed to. I just didn't feel it was realistic. The description of the area was very interesting but she didn't do much with it. It was just a backdrop for the novel. Also, there were epigraphs at the beginning of each chapter that just didn't seem to tie into the story. I read them initially but finally I gave up in the hopes that it would get better or just be over more quickly.  We read this as a book group choice and it was universally hated. I would recommend skipping it.;1
395136;I really enjoyed reading this book. The book has completely different paranormal elements that left me excited to read more. It is not as scary as everyone thinks. I think the way Ms. McNeil wrote the book is perfect!One things I enjoyed about this book is the great characters. Bridget is not the girl that I thought that she would be. She is strong and feisty! She knows what she wants. She doesn't play games, but is real. Ms. Neil really did  a great job on capturing two different types of characters that I never thought I see together. It's amazing and completely unique.The love interest in the book had me at hello! I loved that Bridget dissed him! It made me laugh but also it was fun to read. With all the dark elements of the book, this one made the book balance out and complete it. Bridget is an easy character to fall into her shoes and see things from her point of view.The last thing is loved in the exorcism performed by Bridget and the paranormal twist in it. I must say that  I was in shock to learn the heavy secret that Bridget unveils. But also, I loved how Ms. Neil took this element and made it of her own. It's nicely done, very surprising indeed.A dark and beautiful debut, I like this book. Ok, I admit, I read it during the day! LOL. Still, I loved how Ms. McNeil is able to capture the reader from the very beginning and hook them in. The plot pacing is perfect with every page turn. Even the minor characters play bigger parts that I thought. I can't wait to see what Ms. McNeil writes next!;1
335142;Finished the book in 2 sittings. Enjoyed it immensely and couldn't put it down. I have a lot of respect for Captain Sully and his family and his crew. They did an incredible job and saved a lot of lives. I am glad I could read this superb book. At times it makes you joyous and at times it makes you appreciate the little things that life throws at people. Captain Sully is a true American and a real hero, in my opinion. This book is simply his short/brief narrative of how his life has always been centered around caution, safety and avoiding life threatening risks. A life full of integrity and simplicity. An enjoyable read. It's an excellent book and I highly recommend it to aviation enthusiasts. 5/5;1
24985;I'm a big fan of book of this genre, my favorite being Crichton's Jurassic Park. When I read on the cover that this is compared to Jurassic Park, I had to get it.The overall premise of the book is very interesting, but I was extremely disappointed by the writing. There is no depth whatsoever in the characters. The scientists talk and behave like high school kids. Perhaps the author was too ambitious and tried to deal with way too many characters in the book. Each seemed equally important, so they end up being bland and under-developed. The overall pace of the book is also way too quick, while the details of the animals are great, I could not help but feel that too many things were happening too quickly -- kind of like trying to read a map without glasses while in a fast-moving train in a crazy snow storm.In summary, a great idea delivered poorly. I feel insulted on behalf of Michael Crichton to be compared with such a book.;1

591765;&#34, ...there are as many shipwrecks as there are men ...&#34,Imagine, for a moment, that it was Brown's sunken schooner which makes its way back to the beginning of the novel and becomes the wreckage that caves in the Patna's bulkhead (&#34,as though the ship had steamed across a narrow belt of vibrating water and of humming air&#34,), thus setting the events in motion all over again. This novel would then be a wholly contained circle of doomed fate and circumstance destined to play out the same way over and over, time after time. Perhaps this is why Conrad chose to not only describe Jim as &#34,inscrutable&#34, but also to tell the story through Marlow - a story within a story so that Jim, in essence, more easily becomes us (&#34,one of us&#34, and, truly, &#34,any of us&#34,) and Marlow becomes a sort of God who dispassionately watches us folly.The nested storytelling, the subtle wordplay, the idea that &#34,three hundred miles beyond the end of telegraph cables and mail-boat lines, the haggard utilitarian lies of our civilization wither and die, to be replaced by pure exercises of imagination&#34, creates an unreality that speaks to a truth of our own being better than if we were given an exact replica of Jim. Conrad gives us something infinitely better than an anatomically perfect recreation of a man who, for all the reasons and complexities that make a person a person, fails in his honor and shipwrecks his future - we get &#34,the exact description of the form of a cloud&#34, - a cloud in which we each see something different but is just simply a cloud - just simply us.Ultimately, for me, the novel was about chances, specifically the chances that are missed in life, the missed chances we always remember and can never let go of and forgive ourselves for. And Jim could have easily asked for forgiveness, too - his father, a parson, seemed a very thin analogy with God himself, a God who will forgive if only you truly believe in him, but Jim couldn't even forgive himself for the missed chance and for how he ruined his life.And I kept wondering about his father. Jim kept that letter all those years so you knew it pained him to turn his back on his family and even though he 'knew' he could never go back, he also knew that he didn't actually know that - he still held onto a sliver of hope, even if it was only a hopelessly romantic and boyishly nostalgic one.I wonder if what Conrad was also trying to say is that man is always doomed? There really are no heroes in the novel, in fact the best man we come across, the most successful man, Captain Brierly, just up and decides one day to jump off his ship and drown himself. Did Brierly see his fate clearly to know that he too was doomed, like Jim? Or did he know that if push came to shove he would be just as cowardly as Jim and he couldn't face it, not like Jim could? And how come the biggest bastard in the novel, Captain Brown, is most able to act 'heroically'? Is Conrad trying to say that heroism is born only from selfishness? From wanting to fill one's belly?While I don't know what Conrad actually thought, it seems clear to me that he felt it important to write an entire novel that makes you question the definition of morality, of honor, and of character. That's why Conrad created the 'character' of Jim because he could be any of us, he could be all of us, he represents every one of our individual failures and missed chances and misunderstandings. Jim is like the inner doll of a Russian nesting doll and each character in the novel is one doll larger until we get to the outer doll, us.However, I'm still unsure of what I think the novel was all about. Conrad plays such a literary master game with us that by the end I feel like my head is spinning. The language is beautiful but nonspecific (as Conrad always writes), and the &#34,point&#34, is unclear and open to really any interpretation - I have more questions than answers, but I love that he got me thinking about so many ideas.And this has been the most difficult review of a novel I've ever had to write because it would be like trying to recreate one of Steins perfect butterflies from far away based off of just the verbal description given to us through multiple sources handed out from the jungle 300 miles in and pieced together over a life time. I could spend my life getting caught up in this beautiful novel, constantly going around and around, like Jim, or like fate, or like all of mankind.;1

570040;I had trouble imagining who would find this book intriguing or well presented. I found the opening allegory (which takes up half the book) not only contrived but excessively lengthy.

606452;F. Scott Fitzgerald is an author that represents the 20s in the US, this period where everything was crazy and rich before the Great Depression. This novel is the story of a love affair and of a career, that of Doctor Dick Diver. He is promised to a bright future as a psychiatric doctor. He marries one of the richest heiresses of America who was a patient first of all and became his wife. This love affair is described in the smallest and tiniest details. But Dick Diver comes to the point where he needs to distanciate himself from this ex-neurotic if not schizophrenic wife who was raped by her own father. Dick Diver is also extremely sollicited by many women because he is handsome and charming. He has a short-lived affair with a young Hollywood actress, Rosemary. But his wife Nicole is absolutely dependent on her love for him and cannot survive without his love.The story leads us among the circles of rich Americans and English people who mostly roams the highlighted areas of Europe, spending the money they have and that is always more than they can spend. But a breaking point builds up slowly and explodes sometime in 1927-28. He gets more and more aloof as for his job, if not frankly sloppy and finally gets out of it due to alcoholism. He gets also more and more distant from Nicole. But the real breaking point is when Nicole conquers her freedom through a liaison with another man. Then the end is inevitable : divorce and going back to America to have a general practitioner's office in the state of New York.But the book is a lot more interesting than just this picture. It shows how the very rich are living a complete dream life with caprices, good manners and civility, but no touch with the real world and how they get so far from the real world that they have to develop some kind of a screen to be protected from the fall this distance may represent : alcoholism, an artificial lifestyle and environment, spending as a daily occupation. This is in full contradiction with working to earn a living, which Dick Diver is always doing and a collapse is always at hand and it finally happens. One cannot live the contradiction between a real professional life and an artificial lifestyle. What's more interesting is that the fall comes from this very artificial lifestyle. Alcoholism is a coping strategy that dooms a professional life. Good manners and nicely controled love affairs are also in contradiction with a family life (the doctor has two children) and a professional life. So one day it has to break.Thus the night of the title has many meanings : the nightlife of this detached society, the shadow of all the little affairs and liaisons that remain unrealised or hardly realised, the night of the movie theater since the cinema is always in the background, the night of the end of a love affair, a passion, the night of a lost career. And Doctor Dick Diver submits to this gentle slope going down slowly, to this coming night as if it were a liberation from the obligations of this artificial life. He goes back to reality and gets lost in the night of the unknown, unknown at least for the members of this artificial society of over-rich kids who never grow up. Finally it is a style in the book : every detail is always draped in some kind of shadow, in some kind of night that helps any contradiction and evolution to exist and to survive any kind of crisis.;1

301558;"From internet and media guru Jeff Jarvis (see [...]) comes a critically important work. The World Economic Forum in  Davos named Jarvis as one of the 100 worldwide media leaders in 2007 and 2008. Jarvis was formerly the founding editor and creator of Entertainment Weekly. In his spare time (?) he is a faculty member in the Graduate School of Journalism at City University of New York.This is not the typical chronology and/or biographical approach to Google by someone granted access to either the Company or its inner circle ( See Ken Auletta's ""Googled: The End Of The world As We Know It"" for that sort of treatment). In the Acknowledgments and Disclosures section on the final page of Jarvis' book ""WWGD"" (p.246) he makes his vantage point very clear when he states plainly:""I am grateful for Google's existence, its lessons, and its inspiration - not to mention Marissa Mayer's quotable advice online. But I want to note that I did not seek access to Google for this book because I wanted to judge it and learn from it at a distance. My admiration of Google, then, does not spring from any relationship with the company but from its incredible example.""This book is really about Google's worldview and how they apply (have applied) those beliefs, attitudes and values from the company's genesis, its development, and the initiatives it has (may have) in its sights in the future. Yet, worldviews don't reside in the ""head"" of a company - they inhabit (in varying degrees) the soul, mind and spirit of the founders, managers, engineers - each and every employee and stakeholder invested in this enterprise...and guess what...that includes you as well. As Jarvis succinctly summarizes:""They see a different world than the rest of us and make different decisions as a result, decisions that make no tense under old rules of old industries that are now blown apart thanks to these new ways and new thinkers."" P.4. ""Create and manage abundance rather than control scarcity - as ever, that is the Google worldview."" P. 163How? How did Google lead us all to the baptismal fount to become unwitting, duly confirmed disciples of their services. Answer? They didn't. We did it to each other. Listen to Jarvis:""It is because the single greatest transformative power of the internet and Google has little to do with technology or media or even business. It's about people and making new connections among them. It all comes back to relationships."" P.22. Today's web 2.0 method for growth is to forgo paying for marketing and instead create something so great that users distribute it - it goes viral. Pp.31-32. Google distributes itself. It puts its ads on millions of web pages it does not own, earning billions of dollars for those sites and for itself. It offers scores of widgets-boxes of free, constantly updated content or functionality anyone can add to a web site or desktop: everything from weather to cartoons, chat to calendars, sports scores to photos, recipes to games, quotes to coupons. These widgets are filled with other companies' content, Google merely created the platform to distribute it. Yahoo, AOL, and other content sites should have created such distribution platforms years ago, Cutting themselves up and offering their wealth of content and functionality to others to distribute and build upon. They didn't think that way. They didn't think distributed. They wanted to get us to come to them."" pp.36-37.Yep...we led one another to become disciples of Google, based upon our craving for relationships, connectivity and our penchant for sharing with one another.  As Jeff Jarvis writes: ""Learn this lesson from Google, which spends next to nothing on advertising. It became the fastest growing company in the history of the world without marketing. It grew thanks to its friends, not through ads."" P.46The depth and breadth of Jarvis' insights regarding the current state and future of organization development/entrpreneurship/innovation are too numerous and valuable to attempt to enumerate here. However, the following are a few of my favorites:""You must realize that your crowd - your users, customers, voters, Students, audience, neighbors - is wise. The next questions should be: How do you capture and act on that wisdom? How do you listen? How do you enable them to share their wisdom with each other and with you? How do you help them make you smarter (and why should they bother)? Do you have the systems in place to hear? Do you have the culture in place to act on what you hear?"" p. 88""But the truth about truth is itself counter-intuitive: Corrections do not diminish credibility. Corrections enhance credibility. Standing up and admitting your errors makes you more believable, it gives your audience faith that you will right your future wrongs...Being willing to be wrong is a key to innovation."" P. 91.""Google's lesson is clear: Make innovation your business."" P. 114I absolutely cherished Jarvis' comments about education. I would be remiss if I didn't share my three favorites here. Listen to this:""I imagine a new educational ecology where students may take courses from anywhere and instructors may select any students, where courses are collaborative and public, where creativity is nurtured as Google nurtures it, where making mistakes well is valued over sameness and safety, where education continues long past age 21, where tests and degrees matter less than one's own portfolio of work, where the gift economy may turn anyone with knowledge into teachers, where the skills of research and reasoning and skepticism are valued over the skills of memorization and calculation, and where universities teach an abundance of knowledge to those who want it rather than manage a scarcity of seats in a class. Pp.210-211""Would we be forcing young people to go through 18, 16, or even 12 years of school - trying to get them all to think the same way-before they make things? Instead of the perennial call to subject our youth to mandatory national service - how's that for a way to squander a precious resource? Shouldn't we instead be helping them find and feed their muses?"" P. 212""Why are we still teaching students to memorize facts when facts are available through search? Memorization is not as vital a discipline as fulfilling curiosity with research and reasoning when students recognize what they don't know, form questions, seek answers, and learn how to judge them and their sources."" Pp. 215-216.What are all the ""Google's Rules"" Jarvis discusses throughout the book.?Well, I've referred to several here but you're just going to have to immerse yourself in this work just as I did to garner the spoecifics and appropriate appreciation.Jeff Jarvis' ending touches on a critically important subject, that you must not rush over. It's about creativity. It's poignant:""The internet doesn't make us more creative. Instead, it enables what we create to be seen, heard, and used. It enables every creator to find a public, the public he or she merits. That takes creation out of the proprietary and of the supposed creative class. Internet curmudgeons argue that Google and the internet bring society to ruin because they rob the creative class of its financial support and exclusivity: its pedestal. But internet triumphalists, including me, argue that the internet opens up creativity past one-size-fits-all, mass measurements and priestly definitions of quality and lets us not only find what we like but also find people who like what we do. The internet kills the mass, once and for all. With that comes the death of mass economics and mass media. I don't lament their passing. Pp.239-240.""There is  an abundance of talent and a limitless will to create, but they have been tamped down by an  educational system that insists on sameness,  starved by a mass economic system that rewarded only a few giants, and discouraged by a critical system that anointed a closed creative class. These enemies of mass creativity turned abundance into scarcity. Google and the internet reversed that flow. Now talent of many descriptions and levels can express itself and grow. We want to create and we want to be generous with our creations. We will get the attention we deserve. That means crap will be ignored. It just depends on your definition crap."" P. 240.Jeff Jarvis is a talent and a mind to touch base with regularly. This book, his first, is a superb example of the ""abundance of talent and a limitless will to create"" that Google has had an invisible hand in creating.Get this book! Savor it. Discuss Jarvis' observations and insights with others. Allow the invisible hand to have its way with you. You'll be delighted you did.";1
275059;"I really didn't expect too much when I picked this book up at a bargain store, and I actually had the book for several months before I picked it up and started to read it. Like so many people, I watched the Brady Bunch and sort of grew up with them. I have even watched the re-runs several times. So, I guess I was curious about the life that ""Marcia Brady"", i.e., Maureen mcCormick really led. Boy, was I in for a shock. This is a truthful and brave accounting of a very troubled young woman and all that she went through. It allows us to see how vulnerable we all are and that we all have secrets in our lives that we try to hide. I must say that Maureen McCormick is a strong and brave person to reveal the truth about her life so honestly and openly. She has endured a lot and so have the people who love her. When I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I now have a lot of admiration for Maureen McCormick and the courage she has shown in life and in writing this account of her life. I would imagine this book is a catharsis of sorts for the author, and a well-deserved one, I must say. If you want to know the story of Marcia Brady, here it is. It is well worth the read.";1

It is the power of those stories that has touched the hearts of countless generations and allowed each genertion to discover meaning.You can preach for hours on God's love, a gracious universe, grace, the power of a kind act, courage in facing fears and the only way it will be remembered is if you place your message in the context of a story.  Such a story speaks not to the intellect of the audience but to their hearts.  Such is the importance of fables.The Alchemist is such a tale.  As described in every other review, it follows the wanderings of a young man named Santiago, as he journies across North Africa in seacrch of his dreams.  It is a journey of transformation and discovery.  The tale is exotic, mysterious, and often suspensful.  Like all such tales, it has a generous portion of wisdom to be passed on as the reader follows the experiences of young Santiago.  Very little of the wisdom contained in the story will be entirely new to anyone, but then, that is not the point of a fable.  The author reminds us of things that we already know, giving us a new story upon which to frame our heart's wisdom.  Coelho's wisdom is not theory but draws on experiences that have deeply touched his life. He has pursued his dream and wandered enough to know the associated frustrations and joys. It is evident in the book. I'm quite happy with the result.Coelho's fable joins a small number of similar tales that have been both financial and inspirational successes in recent decades.  The genre evokes strong reactions.  Fables like the Alchemist, The Prophet, or Jonathan Livingston Seagull are either fawned over or ridiculed as so much hot air.  To consider the genre to be so much hot air (as does the Kirkus reviewer) betrays an ignorance of the genre that should move the wise critic to refrain from offering his or her uninformed opinion. However, neither should the reader treat such tales as divine revelation.The course of wisdom is somewhere in between.  This genre speak to the heart and not necessarily the intellect.  The logic of these stories is that of dreams not the intellect.  Even then, not all fables are of equal value.  The message being shared is important.  Does the story ring true to life, offering practical wisdom?  Or, is it simply platitudes being offered in hushed tones and carefully marketed?  As I read through The Alchemist and other works by Paulo Coelho I was pleased to discover numerous insights hidden away in off handed comments.  Many of these insights are not new but were reached on my own over the years.  I take this as confirmation of the substance of Coelho's message and the fact that he has traveled the path himself.  The Alchemist is neither sacred scripture, a philosophical treatise, nor a post-modern deconstruction of contemporary social values.  Rather, it is an enjoyable tale that has much to say to the heart.;1
585790;"This is the most overrated book I have ever come across.The book has a gripping opening which then sadly degenerates into a rambling, non sensical, scattered and un-entertaining mess. Character development and plot are sacrificed for the author's self indulgence and obvious loss as to how to continue the narrative against the backdrop of historical ""accuracy"".Wasted potential hardly describes the huge misfire of this novel, do not waste your time on this!";1
352675;"Those plucky March girls - Meg, Jo, Amy and Beth - are centerstage in this campy spin on Alcott's classic. With their father away at war and their beloved Marmee raising them to be humanitarian vampires, this quartet of femme fatales is learning that it's not always easy for the undead to coexist with their human neighbors. You just never know if a vampire slayer has a stake in your future (literally) or, for that matter, if the beau who's courting your sister has a wicked agenda to decapitate all of your kin while they're sleeping. Add to this batty mix the trials and tribulations of young romance, most notably in the form of guy pal Laurie who's so earnestly pining and whining to join the ranks of the immortal that you can't help but fear he'll fall into bad company if one of the sibs doesn't hurry up and grant his dying wish. This snappy spoof has all the earmarks of a fun movie, especially given the current obsession with men who sport fangs and sleep in coffins. Speaking of movies, this book is replete with some pretty hysterical footnotes that - like end credits and bloopers in a film - you might have the misfortune to miss if you don't read past THE END. Here's a sample:6. International bestseller by Dimitri Strinsky (b. 1294), translated into 37 languages, including Swahili. Its sequel, ""Seven More Signs of a Vampire Slayer and How I Missed Them the First Time,"" is also a classic.7. The Pinkerton National Detective Agency, established in 1850 by Allan Pinkerton, who became famous after foiling an attempt to assassinate President-elect Abraham Lincoln. Pinkerton was the first personal-security agency to hire vampires to screen for slayers.15. A primitive version of what is now known as a solar cloak, which makes it possible for vampires to go out in the sun. Filtering out the sun's rays wasn't possible until the invention of Gore-Tex in 1976 by Wilbert L. Gore.17 Such parlor games did not become illegal until 1907, when the Freedom from Vampire Cruelty Despite Personal Preference for Vampire Cruelty Act was passed.36. Invented by Harken Hennings (b. 1803) in 1853 and very popular with defenders working in the modern urban crime environment. His first attempt at vampire armor, an iron neckerchief to protect one from decapitation, had to be recalled because sharp clasps of the garment inadvertantly removed the wearer's head.";1

Sent to live at Misslethwaite Manor with her mysterious uncle, Mary has a lot to adjust to in her new life. What she didn't expect was the strange sound echoing through Misslethwaite's halls at night, or the wild beauty of a secret garden locked and hidden for many years.Although this is a children's classic, kids of all ages will love this story, full of rich characters and just the right touch of suspense. Francis Ford Copella directed a lovely movie version a few years ago which is very true to the story. Read the book, then enjoy the film!;1
306226;Charles Todd has created another wonderful mystery set in the outlying places of England.His investigator, Ian Rutledge, is as usual, a very strong character who is interesting with or without the mysteries going on around him. As evidenced, for instance, by the voice in his head of the long-dead Scotsman who served in the war with him. One has to wonder at times if he really has a ghost at his shoulder or if his mind has bent slightly under some misguided guilt over Hamish's death.I always enjoy Mister Todd's prose. It's soft and easy and never leaves me wanting--except, of course, for more of the book. I hate to see his stories end.Highly Recommended!Diane Davis White;1
497526;Very informative. This book was an excellent start to my research and it's  definitely something I wil read more than once. Also, it was written beautifully and gives you more than enough details so that you may easily imagine every person, place and thing in the book.;1
454317;I received Reboot in return for an honest review from the publisher HarperTeen via edelweiss.  Wren has been a Reboot for 5 years working for the humans as mindless slave. She died from three gunshot wounds five years ago, they almost didn't think she would reboot but she did at 178 minutes which is rare. Since Wren is a higher number she doesn't have all the feelings and conflicts over killing humans or other reboots like the under sixty's do.As the new trainee's for reboot training arrive Wren is drawn to 22 who are still close to human. She decides to take the risk but her new trainee isn't going to be easy, because he questions everything even refusing to kill putting them both at risk. As if Wren doesn't have enough to deal with her 22 she's also dealing with a roommate who is losing it quickly. When Ever dies and Callum her 22 is at risk of being terminated Wren has to do something before it's too late.She reaches out to a human hoping he will be able to help the unlikely pair. He agrees under the condition they save his daughter who is also a reboot in Austin. Even with his help removing the trackers escaping the area won't be easy, thankfully the pair can take damage and heal. With his help the pair escapes into the darkness, heading off to save his daughter but before they can get her things for Callum aren't looking so good. When they reach the rebels they learn that his time is running out. Wren will have to risk it all to save Callum.I really love Wren she's smart but strong, yet on the inside she has her own issues, insecurities making her easy to relate to. I was able to connect with her, her story even if for a zombie is filled with emotions from heartache to love even hope for the future.  I think Callum is perfect for her, his personality is relaxed taking his time and I felt that he really does see Wren for who she is not the scars she carries. I've always been a fan of Kick Ass Heroines and Wren fits the bill perfectly.I was super excited to be approved for Reboot it's been on my TBR list forever. The concept is instantly captivating it's a unique twist on the zombie idea. I love that the author made the zombies more than mindless shambling bodies, they are still partially human. The story is filled with action, moments or horror, even a very sweet romance that mix to create a brilliant story. I had a hard time putting Reboot down it's one of those books that just draws the reader in and doesn't let go till the last page. Then leaving you wanting more, I can't wait to get my hands on the next book in the series since I loved Reboot so much!;1
356698;I received my copy of Vampire Crush through Goodreads First Reads giveaways.Sophie McGee is ready to start the new school year, she is determined to be the Editor-in-Chief of the school paper and thinks she has a great shot at it with her investigative skills. Her teacher tasks Sophie and her Editor in Chief rival with interviewing the new kids at school, and a strange bunch they are. The new students are as odd as their names, and before long Sophie has realized that there is something off about them. Vlad especially seems to get whatever he wants from whomever he wants. The foursome don't keep up their charade of being new high school students very well, and Sophie puts her investigative skills to work to find out why they're really there.Another mystery is that the house next door that has been empty for awhile, is now reoccupied. Sophie's friend James who used to live there has returned, but alone after his parents died, and he doesn't want anyone to know he's back. Predictably that doesn't last for long.When Vlad starts dating Sophie's sister Caroline, it becomes even more important to find out what she can. Something is just not right about him, and she doesn't want Caroline to get hurt. In the meantime Sophie has inadvertently made friends with another of the new students, Violet, who speaks, acts and dresses old-fashioned. She's become fascinated by teen magazine surveys and advice on boys, as she has someone she's in love with, but can't keep.So many things to find out, what happened to James while he was gone, how is he connected with the new kids at school, and why are they really there?This was a cute read, but not anything that will stick out for me so I gave it a 3/5. I liked Sophie, James and Violet the most, Vlad the least, he was super annoying in my opinion. I prefer likable bad guys I guess. It's possible that it was just targeted towards a younger age group than I really enjoy and that I was expecting too much from it compared to all of the other teen vampire fiction I've read that is more complex and intense. Sophie is written with a fun sarcastic but light style, and I did enjoy it. I think as a debut this was good. The back of my copy suggests an age group of 12 and up, and recommends it to fans of Vampire Kisses and the Vladimir Tod series, with which I would have to agree.;1
373803;Wonderful book.  A lot of twists in it.  It's a YA book, but I think everyone would like it.  A game turns dangerous for Heather and the other seniors in a small town.  A lot of money at stake and some people will do anything to win.  Very well written.;1

157021;"In the interest of full disclosure, I hold an MBA and was very skeptical when I acquired this book.  To get to my point, this book  exceeded my expectations and is an excellent refresher for those who hold an MBA, and a great preview for those about to start an MBA program.  The book would also be very beneficial for those individuals interested in possessing an overview of the material covered in MBA programs.STRENGTHS--The book is comprehensive.  You will receive an overview of the content covered in MBA programs.  The major courses of study are all included from Finance to Operations to Strategy.GREAT STRENGTH--I wish I had read the chapter on Quantitative Analysis prior to entering my MBA program.WEAKNESSES--As I mentioned, the book is comprehensive but a bit superficial and definitely inadequate.  To be fair, the author concedes, I believe, at least the second point above.  In particular, the title is a bit pretentious, to be forward.  That is, no one can really learn (or earn) an MBA in ten days.  Nevertheless, in ten days, one can certainly have a well framed concept of the material under study in MBA programs.  And, as I said, this book is an excellent and highly recommended refresher for those holding an MBA.  I finished the book in two days.MAJOR WEAKNESS (touches on cources in ethics in MBA curriculum)--I think the focus on ethics is great in theory but of little --indeed if any-- pratical benefit.  I am not sure if taking a course in ethics can make one ethical or even more inclined to be ethical in her/his decision-making.  To be forward, ethics should not be a separate course but integrate into the program, perhaps into each course.  People should be ethical in all of their behaviors and decisions (business, personal, or otherwise), and an entire course focused on ""business ethics"" is of, seriously, little value.MY PERSONAL COMMENTARY ON MBA EDU. (you have been warned!)--I think of particular importance for MBA students today is attention paid to ""international business.""  I would encourage anyone considering entering an MBA program to consider studying abroad for a quarter (if you can) or attending a seminar with international students and business leaders overseas.  The benefits from this will be long-lasting and fulfilling.  By no means am I advocating attending an MBA program outside of the USA, although there are truly great programs.  I am suggesting taking a course or attending a seminar in an international environment among students, participants from all over the world.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION--The book is engaging, easy-to-read, and very beneficial in terms of presenting the language of business and MBA concepts.  The book does not waste your time, and the mini-courses at the end are quite inadequate but do present important areas of study.  I confidently recommend this book, and please keep in  mind this is at least one reader who was initially skeptical but has definitely benefitted from taking the time to read this book.";1

535359;An expert in wine may appreciate the smallest nuiance in it's character, but the search for that nuiance takes precedent over the enjoyment of the bottle.  If you want a story that will require you to revell in the smallest of subtleties at the expense of enjoyment of the book, then Waiting is for you.  If you a looking for a tale of love, faith or hope, there are much better pages to turn. The prolouge reveals to us that the Lin's sought after divorce will not materialize for 18 years, so we read the next 200 pages knowing that Lin and Manna Wu will not be united, if at all,  until much later.  While the details of the 18 years are, at first, interesting, they begin to blur together into a series of inconsequential events.  Like Lin and Manna Wu, who become comfortable in their relationship rut and plod along, the reader churns through the pages and plods through the story.  While it is true that the years build and develop the characters, they do so at a snails pace.  How many times do we have to be shown that Lin is indecisive and timid ?  How often will Lin and Manna Wu suffer because they cannot break out of societal norms ?  The plot develops more in the final chapters, but the outcome is telegraphed.  Lin's eventual revelation that they waited just for the sake of waiting is both predictable and, worse, emotionally unsatifying for the reader.  A true critic might call this a love story of infinte subtlety.  I would not call it a love story at all.  Ha Jin has instead written a political allegory of 60's and 70's China.  Lin's wife and his love respectively symbolize the old and the new China as they fight for the soul of Lin.  Lin is the people of China whose infinite patience ( or is Ha Jin saying infinite timidity? ) makes them unable to act and unable to change things for the better.  For a book praised for its' subtlety, the symbolism is obvious.;1

534434;After seeing David Fincher's rendition of Chuck Palahnuik's &quot,Fight Club&quot,, this author has been a bit of a role model for me.  Palahnuik strives to uncover the depression that glazes over society ten-fold.  He did it in Fight Club with Jack and Tyler Durden, and Tender Bransen is the next victim.  From the first chapter (which is 49, and the last is 1), Palahnuik delivers a masterpiece outlining people's meaningless lives and their pursuit of happiness.  Call it a twist of John Locke's ideaology, but Palahnuik improves with each book.  Although Survivor is not as good as Fight Club, Survivor depicts the &quot,15 minutes of fame&quot, with unbelieveable truth.Palahnuik's novels are never a hard read, however, its disturbing sidenotes and descriptions make this book a tough one to forget.  &quot,Survivor&quot, is a magnificent novel, a quick read with some great meaning and wonderful moral.;1

224858;"I didn't see the reviews for this book until after I read it since a good reader-friend recommended it.  AND IT IS A GREAT READ!  I have never been so disturbed as I was reading this book but I couldn't put it down.  I had a very hard time relating to the relationship between mother and son and yet I couldn't put it down.  I kept trying to think if I knew anyone who remotely may have felt the way this mother did during her pregnancy and while raising her son and I really couldn't (thank goodness) but I still couldn't put it down! I still found it very believable. I was thoroughly engrossed in this story, the way it was written (very different which I really appreciated), the twists and turns and the somewhat surprising ending.  I thought it was brilliant! I highly recommend this book to adults.I just took a glance at the less flattering reviews and obviously I disagree but I suppose that's why there are millions of book choices out there.  I found one review that beat up on the author for the word choices (""people don't talk like that"").  As I reflect on that review having recently finished this book I actually found the vocabulary refreshing.  I ocassionally used my Kindle dictionary and had the opportunity to expand my own vocabulary.  So what?  I don't talk like that but I found the vocabulary consistent by character throughout and therefore found it believable that the mother DID talk like that.This book is not for the faint at heart.  If you're looking for something different, thought provoking with a lot of drama you'll be happy with this read. I doubt anyone is looking for a ""disturbing"" read but it was and like I said I just couldn't put it down.While the story line is totally different from the movie the Omen I found myself thinking about the Omen often as I read this because it evoked the same feelings.  Perhaps that comment will help some of you decide if it's the kind of ""disturbing"" you could read and still enjoy.";1
582246;The narrator, Jack Gladney, is a professor of Hitler Studies, a program he created in order to be a sort of celebrity figure and even an American icon. Of course his ambition is an absurd one. To erect Hitler studies as a &quot,product&quot, like Panasonic and Lexus is to be morally disconnected from the meaning of Hitler. But of course Jack is drunk, like most Americans, on commercialism. He believes, erroneously, that commercialism at its best converts mundane things into icons, giving them the power to transcend the one thing that nags Jack above all else--death. His misguided attempt at transcendence results in an amazing final scene that I cannot divulge for fear that the current reader has not yet read the novel.Final note: The book contains priceless aporphisms that are for me the real treasure of the novel.;1
394505;"The topic of amnesia has been done over and over again both in books and in movies.  Probably because it is such an intriguing and frightening topic.  In Before I Go to Sleep, the main character, Christine has an amnesia that effected everything that occurred after an ""accident.""  When she wakes up every morning, she still thinks she is in her 20's instead of the 47 that she actually is, she has no memory of the house that she is living in, or of her husband lying beside her in bed.

They tell her who she is, they remind her that she is married  and that her husband's name is Ben.Everyday Christine wakes up with no memory of the day before.  Until she starts seeing Dr. Nash, who has her write in a journal, to see if it will help restore her memory.  Then sometime during the day, Dr. Nash will call her, tell her who he is, and tell her where to find the journal.

Christine must piece together the bits and pieces of her life from the journal.  She must figure out what was her accident that left her memory damaged.  Ben tells of an auto accident, but Christine has faint memories that suggest something much more sinister.This book held my interest from beginning to end, hard to put down at times, even.  Predictable, but with a few surprises thrown in.";1
76015;"This is just about the best mystery I've read in a while and approaches the quality of IN A DRY SEASON, which Robinson wrote a few years back.  The author does a great job of developing a tight plot with a few twists and turns that may surprise the most dedicated mystery lover. Robinson also further develops his the main characters Alan and Annie, as well as introducing a six-foot tall Jamaican immigrant female police officer who is bound to turn up again (one hopes!).Several mystery writers have used fire as a ""character"" in their novels including Patricia Cornwell, P.D. James, and Elizabeth , so you might think Robinson could not come up with something very different, but he does.  He crafts a new and from my perspective particularly horrible slant as he merges perspective of the victim, the art world, old and new friendships, and the ongoing development of the relationship between Annie and Alan.For ages, female mystery writers have created and directed the exploits of male investigators. Robinson turns the tables, very effectively as he explores the psyche of Annie who is becoming almost as likeable as Harriet Vane. Robinson shows that females don't have to be dumb bunnies who are rescued from the jaws of death after they stupidly play into the killer's hands - sometimes the male needs rescuing. I thoroughly enjoyed this mystery, reading past my bed time to finish it.";1
403900;While I absolutely loved the two previous installments, 'Evertrue' barely evoked my interest. The plot didn't do anything for me, it was plain, uneventful, and awfully convenient.Jack's over-protectiveness was extremely tiring and I just wanted to remove him for most of the book. However, it was Cole's storyline that completely surprised and thoroughly disappointed me. 'Everbound' ended dramatically with many possibilities for the third and final book. There was so much more behind Cole's phony, deceiving ways and finally we would get a glimpse beyond the facade. Or so I thought.Ashton most likely made the deliberate decision of not including a love triangle, even though Cole obviously wanted more than for Nikki to become queen. Since I wasn't favoring Jack much, sure, I wouldn't have minded the possibility of Nikki and Cole. If only to stir up some emotions. At the very least, I just wished we'd gotten to see his vulnerability.Instead, [SPOILER ALERT: Cole goes and suffers from amnesia and doesn't know who he is until the very end.

565154;"Through my reviewing activities, I've become a fan of Jeffrey Gitomer's ""Little Book"" series.  His latest, Little Green Book of Getting Your Way: How to Speak, Write, Present, Persuade, Influence, and Sell Your Point of View to Others, is another excellent volume that applies to far more than just the stereotypical ""salesman"".Contents:Getting Ready to Get Your Way, The Fundamentals of Getting Your Way, The Fundamentals of Persuasion and Personal Power, The Essentials of Getting Your Way, Power Presentation, Persuasion Performance, Sales Persuasion Performances, The Write Way to Get Your Way, Persistence, EloquenceNow on the surface, you may think this sounds very manipulative.  But think about it...  Sales is all about persuasion and ""getting your way.""  And sales is much broader than you think.  You ""sell"" when you go to a job interview.  You ""sell"" when you're in a project meeting talking about how you will implement a system.  And of course, you sell when you have a title of ""sales rep"".  Using the ideas and techniques that Gitomer packages here, you'll find yourself much better prepared to be successful in the course of your sales efforts.  Much of what he covers is based on attitude...  with the right attitude, you are half way there.  If you go in confident about your ""product"" and benefits, people will be more likely to have an interest that you can build on.  Go in thinking you don't stand a chance, and you won't.I think my favorite chapter is on ""power presentations.""  It consists of 25 pages of tips and attitudes that can turn every presentation into a memorable event.  And that's not just sales presentations either (although presentations are all trying to sell something, if even just ideas...)  Commanding a room, asking engaging questions, using props, etc.  These are all things that *any* presenter should be aware of and strive for.  And since everything is short and to the point, you can review this material on a regular basis and come away with something new to practice each time.If you understand that persuasion is more than just ""getting your way"" and that selling doesn't always involve a cash transaction, you'll immediately grasp what Gitomer is talking about.  And if you *don't* understand those concepts, then you need this book even more.  This should be a fixture on your bookshelf, and it should pay back your investment of money and time many times over...";1
178905;Catch-22- saddening, thought provoking, hope inspiring, and really rather good.  no, not everyone dies, even though it starts to appear that way.  i dont usually care for war related things that often, but this was worth reading.  It takes a humorous and cynical approach the pointlessness of trying to escape war and the headaches it can cause.  Catch-22 is the ultimate devil in this book and it consistantly pops up.  The story follows one man and his struggles to survive in an insane and hopeless world.  Add in a bunch of pilots begging to get home, a doctor who is technically dead, and a mess seargent who uses logic that surpasses everyone else's minds, and you have one motley crew.  A book of laughs, tears, puzzlement, and thinking, Catch-22 is a book worth reading.;1
109679;IT HAPPENED ONE AUTUMN is the second book in Lisa Kleypas' Wallflower series.  The series is the stories of four women who band together to find husbands.  This book is the story of Lillian Bowman, the daughter of a wealthy American shoemaker, who has come to England to catch a peer for a husband.  Sparks fly between Lillian and Marcus, the Earl of Westcliff.  Lillian finds Marcus to be cold and domineering, Marcus finds Lillian to be an ungovernable menace.  Of course, that makes them perfect for one another!I really enjoyed this book.  The romance between Lillian and Marcus sparkles.  The book is funny and emotional.  Keypads, of course, writes in such a manner that every page is interesting.  My only complaint is that I find Lillian a difficult heroine to love.  I believe it is my bias and not any weakness in the story.  Bo th Lillian and Marcus are arrogant, strong willed characters.  That makes it somewhat difficult for me to like her as quickly.This book also has the strong appearance of St. Vincent,who is the villain here and the hero in the next book.  I think he steals the book and the last part of the epilogue is my favorite.;1
606015;This is not the book to be lightly read. This does not imply however that this book is heavy in a sense of being boring or ancient in the feel. On the contrary, this is a book to seduce, mesmerise and captivate you and you have to let it. It is like the first shower of rain after an angry summer, which suddenly appears surprising all the nearly identical weather bulletins in a hot afternoon.If you try to run away from it, hide from the rain, it will bother you to no end and wreck your nerves, particularly as you try to hide you find no shelter within reach. But then what you can do is surrender to the beauty of the change of weather and soak in the sweet smell of rain falling on the parched Earth. That is how this book is to be read.

584952;...you won't be able to put it down!!  I got this book as a sweet gift from my boyfriend.  I had just finished reading all three books by Thomas Harris following our attendance to 'Hannibal'.  I was thirsting for more literature on a fiendish character who had intelligence, wit, and allure.  I was skeptical at first but I trusted my boyfriend's judgement (he had read it previously).  Well, when I started to read it, I found myself drawn more and more into the book as if being drawn toward someone or something's alluring scent.The story is about a boy who has no scent and because he has no scent, he did not have a presence.  However, he had a gift of smelling.  He could smell anything and everything.  His nose is so good that he can describe someone without having seen them at all.  In fact, his goal is to make the ultimate scent that nobody could resist.  And he does this by....You'll have to read and find out!!;1

503321;"One would think that after writing five completely charming novels about the despair of three orphans, Lemony Snicket would have trouble writing another novel that lives up to the creativeness, randomness, and humor of it's predecessors.  One would be wrong.Snicket's writing is strong and hilarious as always-- it's the plot that makes this one sometimes drag.  While the story is mostly interesting, hearing about the Baudelaires climbing an endless flight of steps gets old after a while.  This is a small flaw in the story, and the rest of the novel is very strong.  It can be said that a writer who creates a character then readers hate and want to physically shake is a good writer, and this is what Snicket does when he creates the character of Esme, a new guardian of our favorite orphans, who only cares about things that are ""in.""This story has many literally strong points that the previous novels in this series do not, such as1. a red herring (a literal AND a figurative)2. a huge element of surprise3. heightened suspense4. this book gives you a lot of information on certain things, but also leaves you with more questions.  This technique is often done by J. K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, and is a big reason for the series' success.  Readers will surely want to come back to have their questions answered, and with ""The Ersatz Elevator,"" Mr. Snicket had undoubtedly secured a returning audience.If all of the above doesn't convince you to read this sixth volume in A Series of Unfortunate Events, know this: reading Snicket's fun and informative narration will improve your vocabulary!7/10";1
646439;It is unfortunate that most first time readers of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE see it merely as one more book to be endured in 11th grade English.  However, most soon enough catch the magic of an author (Jane Austen) who can weave a spellbinding tale of love, romance, satire, and passion while all the while poking a not so gentle thrust at the social mores of the early 19th century.  This book is no frilly ancestor of a Harlequin romance, even if it shares with the dim-witted heroines of Harlequin a time-honored plot of lovers who meet and find an instant dislike that later morphs into enduring love.  PRIDE AND PREJUDICE starts off with that basic premise, but what sets it off as classic is what goes on behind the lovers, Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy.  A careful reader usually notes the society in which Elizabeth and Darcy play out their little games of cross-purpose verbal repartee.  The world of Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is a society ruled by conniving and single-minded women who see men only in terms of the size of their wallets.  Whenever a new bachelor appears on the scene, the women of the novel (with the exception of Elizabeth, of course) immediately try to guess his income so that they can decide if one wishes to marry him.  His age, his looks, his habits are much less significant than his income.  A fat purse compensates for a fat head.Modern readers typically call such schemers 'golddiggers,' and according to modern values, perhaps they are, but these readers ought to judge the book's morality against the age in which it was written.  Austen (1775 - 1817) lived in an England that prized manners and breeding over all else.  It is no surprise, then, that since the reclusive author felt most comfortable only in the company of women, that she would limit her book only to the thoughts, feelings, emotions, and habits of women.  In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, men are never permitted to occupy center stage, nor are they shown interacting independently with other men.  If a man is present in any scene, so must a woman to control and observe his actions. Men--even the eventually triumphant Darcy--are generally portrayed as vain, sycophantic, sarcastic, and totally aware that they they are prized only for their money.The world of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, especially if one has seen the fine film version starring Greer Garson, is one that seems to have been built for women to inhabit.  All the women wear flouncy, bouncy dresses with huge flowered hats that Scarlet O'Hara might have worn in GONE WITH THE WIND.  Even those ladies that complain of poverty never lack the funds to afford those outrageous outfits.  Further, Miss Austen stages a ball in just about every third chapter that permits single women to size up eligible men.  As these dandefied women and uniformed men speak to each other, the modern reader probably will be surprised at the excessive politeness and deference tossed unerringly about.  This strict adherence to a surface morality ought not to fool the reader into assuming that the characters are as inwardly noble as they are outwardly polite.  In fact, behind this massive wall of formal phrasing and good manners lies the same fears, jealousies, and general backstabbing that pervade a modern disco.  What gives PRIDE AND PREJUDICE its perpetual charm is the biting irony that causes the reader to wonder: 'Did that character say what I think he (or she) just said?' The modern reader can best appreciate Austen's wit if she can read between the lines to sense the tone of the moment.  If such a reader can see that this book is a polite if powerful indictment of a way of life that even Austen wished to poke fun of, then perhaps this reader can appreciate the charm of a book that grows with each successive reading.;1
71217;"NOTE: This review will be about the book, and not about other people's reviews of the book.For background, I am a single, 30-something Christian, and I enjoy Dr. Laura's show and her politics, and her advice.  This book is a great revelation of the specific principles that underlie her marital and ethical philosophy.  Contrary to common belief, Dr. Lara works from fixed principles. Her show and philosophy is not a series of ""hissy fits"" or ""power trips.""  She is articulating very ancient, and even eternal laws of conduct and behavior.  By compliance to these law, we can improve our lives.In essence, Dr. Laura is doing something that few authority do.  She reveals her sources and is open about her bias. I got a four-year Bachelors degree, and in those five years, only once did a professor mention a bias.This book is not a missionary tract.  Rather, it is more of a deposition and testament of what she believes. In the preface, she freely mentions that she struggled with the issues contained in the ten commandments.  This is why it is co-written with a rabbi.  Sometimes I got the feel that I was reading a rabbinical debate-it's there in the subtext. You know the old saying about two Jews and three opinions. I love the sub-text of discussion and debate.I found the book easy to read, agree with some of her conclusions, and was in now way offended by the religious tone. And I enjoyed the Jewish insights, especially how Jews, Catholics, and Protestants divide the commandments differently. Jews see the first commandment as ""I am the Lord thy God,"" where as Catholics and Protestants skip this preface, and go directly to ""Thou shalt have no gods before me."" This preface is a pause and consideration of the nature, grandeur and existence of God.  This pause and preface lays the foundation for the rest of the commandments.I recommend this book to people of all branches of Judeo-Christianity.  This nexus of faiths are all tied to Abraham and Moses.  There is something of these laws in all religions, and I value Dr. Laura's and Rabbi Vogel's insights on the matter.";1
24131;This true story covers a very pertinent topic, a topic which is no w receiving much coverage in the American press  finding that the story actually occurred over twenty years ago and in England left me wondering, actually hoping, that the British system for meeting the needs of abused children has been more strongly developed.  The story was well written, although I had hoped for more details- which would not have divulged any confidentiality.  I also wondered why the carers did not go to the pub and retrieve the foster child when she was late returning home. The name of the pub was mentioned several times when the police brought the child home to the carers.  I would recommend this book for those interested in the subject matter, those dealing with a self abuser, or those entering the fields of social work, psychology or education.;1

The other books in the series would often elicit laughs and comments, but this one I think is just too low on humour.  That being said, this book is very cute!  When I read it to groups of kids and parents I don't get many laughs, but I do get lots of ""AWWS"" from the parents.  Teague's illustrations are as stellar as always.  I think if you've got a little dinosaur fan that loves the rest of the series, your child will love this one too.  If not, I would stick with some of Yolen's earlier dinosaur books.";1

This sequel offers some more sit on the edge of your seat excitement.The characters are believable and the plot makes me wonder what would happen if there was an outbreak that caused people to change--zombies, vampires, etc. The one intriguing part of the book is the ways in which the vampires want to go home and have this sense of want for their ""dear ones.""

519499;"We have all had to learn creative financing to get along in the new millennium, so it's about time someone came along with a creative thinking strategy that works. And Tim Hurson has done just that inThink Better: An Innovator's Guide to Productive Thinking.Like some reviewers, I was reluctant to get this book because there are so many others on the market. But I did and am very pleased with the results of reading and studying it. I now have a more organized mind, uncluttered with unnecessary trivia, a mind that has learned to focus. And for a writer, focus is the necessary asset to keep churning out copy.Some reviewers say this book is easy... In some ways it is and in some, it isn't...

It's easy to understand Monkey Mind, Gator Brain and Elephant's Tether, even fun at times, but when it comes to ""cerebral cortex"" and such, the author loses me. But he soon makes himself clear, but with deep thinking on my part, I must admit.But I did get through it and came out better on the other end...lol...In the author's opening words: ""This book is about creating the future. It's about a way to see more clearly, think more creatively, and plan more effectively. It's about thinking better, working better and doing better in every area of your life."" I'll go for that--and I did! This book delivers what it promises. I wish I had had it when I ran my publishing business, but am glad to have it now. No matter what you do, from writing, managing a small household or a big business, this book can help you.I also appreciated the wise, humorous quotes and tidbits of information the author scatters throughout this book, such as this quote from humorist Will Rogers: ""It's not what you don't know that hurts you. It's what you do know that ain't so.""I treasure the wealth of information in the pages ofThink Better: An Innovator's Guide to Productive Thinking.

284927;Rosie Winter and her friend Jayne Hamilton return to New York from a USO tour in the South Pacific.  Rosie's homecoming is not a bed of roses.  When the two visit the family of Jayne's recently deceased fiance, they discover that Billy DeMille is not exactly the man they thought he was.  Rosie decides to search out the mystery behind the identity of Billy DeMille while also trying to help Jayne cope with the grief of her loss.  Rosie herself must re-examine her feelings for her ex-, Jack Castegate, who has returned home injured and engaged to a WAC private.  Rosie and Jayne return to the familiar boarding house, the George Bernard Shaw Home for Women Pursuing Theatrical Vocations, to find themselves home yet not quite home.  Likewise, Rosie comes home to a country that has changed since her absence.  Fears of saboteurs have excited the imagination of the newspapers and the hint of a German ancestry provokes suspicion.  Jayne's former boyfriend Tony, a mobster, resurfaces and the mobsters seem to behind the women's casting rejections.  Rosie finds herself telling lie after lie, always with the best intentions of helping or protecting her friends.  Will Rosie be able to discover the man behind the facade of Billy DeMille?  Will she be able to help her friends or will her lies box her into a dangerous circle?Set in 1943, WHEN WINTER RETURNS, Kathyrn Miller Haines creates an energetic, fast-paced mystery with several intriguing clues to keep the puzzle lover guessing.  WHEN WINTER RETURNS, and the Rosie Winter mysteries in general, add a freshness to the scope of WWII mysteries.  Rosie's adventures take a reader into the world of performers, mobsters and German-Americans.  The author brings this period alive beyond history book facts, not only in the cast of characters, but also through Rosie's reflections on the changed state of society at home.  Now, returning home after seeing seen the war up close, Rosie sees the naivete of the faith she once had. Indeed, the theme of loss runs throughout the story, giving a rich emotional background to the characters.  Kathyrn Miller Haines interweaves historical details of the acting industry personnel as well as the influence of the Alien Registration Act within the very heart of the story.  WHEN WINTER RETURNS is all the richer for the author's ability to see both the dangers of the policy as well as the threat of saboteurs.  Through Rosie's eyes, a reader easily feels the tensions of the times as well as the conflicting tensions within an individual.  Cough syrup brands and other period details give a sense of historical authenticity that goes beyond history book events.Despite the losses surrounding Rosie, she is a dynamic woman, a woman always ready to help her friends.  Rosie finds herself spinning a web of lies in an effort to protect her friends, a scenario that a bit of humor to the story as the reader watches her box herself into a corner.  Seeing the homeland at war through Rosie's eyes expands a reader's view of the times while the action-packed mystery leaves a reader on their toes.  Kathryn Miller Haines gives women readers a window into some of the difficulties bright, sharp women might have experienced but never at the expense of the mystery or the story itself.  Rosie's reflections never distract from the plot but rather bring a reader inside her thoughts.  The reader sees through her eyes.  As a lover of WWII mysteries, this reader finds Rosie Winter a must addition to my historical mystery collection.  As a first time reader to the Rosie Winter Mystery, WHEN WINTER RETURNS leaves a reader eager to explore the earlier books in the series to discover more about the character, particularly those events that lead up to this particular moment.  Although WHEN WINTER RETURNS works as a stand-alone, this reader would recommend that new readers pick up earlier books in addition to this one to be able to fulfill that curiosity.  Highly recommended to mystery lovers and WWII historical fiction lovers!Courtesy of Book Illuminations;1
96416;"I first read The Velveteen Rabbit when I was eight and sick with scarlet fever myself.  Fortunately, by the time I battled scarlet fever it wasn't the deadly disease it had been in previous generations but it was still serious enough that I was stuck in bed for 10 days and bored out of my gourd.  This book was a great comfort to me because it kept me entertained and I could easily relate to the story, especially since I had a teddy bear who was very ""real"" to me at the time just as the boy had his rabbit.  Over the course of the years, however, my old story book started to show it's age and after awhile I lost it altogether.  So I was very happy to find this kindle edition to share the story with my own children now.  Every time I read this story with them we end up talking about the first time I read it as a kid and it leads into entire discussions about the things I saw and did as a kid.  It's been a lot of fun for my kids hearing the story of the velveteen rabbit but it's also been alot of fun for me too.  Lots of memories.";1
39796;OK that feeling of crushing disappointment, anyone recognise it? ANYONE tell me I'm not the only one PLEASE.What a disappointing end. *sigh* *double sigh* I feel like I emotionally invested myself so much and the book was so disappointing.I feel so distressed and quite confused. It honestly felt like a different author had written this book, only this author was hell bent on including so many plot holes and tearing apart the faction world that had been created. As soon as we moved away from the world of factions and the story is moved outside the city, the book quite frankly fell apart. I am very sorry but I think it is impossible for me to review this book without being a tad spoilery. If you haven't read the book and don't want spoilers, look away now and please excuse me whilst I have a little rant.In terms of characters, Tobias was the most frustrating and difficult to sympathise with. It's like he has had a complete character change out of nowhere. He is no longer able to process situations logically, gone is the intelligent instructor who is able to calculate his decisions and movements logically. Instead we are placed with a Tobias who doesn't take in the facts and make rational decisions. Seriously, this character change is ridiculously frustrating and honestly it doesn't make sense to me. It doesn't contribute anything to the plot but instead created unnecessary complications. On the bright side, Tris kicked butt in this book and she was still a really good heroine.Was I the only one getting slightly confused as I was reading? A lot of the time it was getting really complicated for no reason. I could've seen the book written in a way that had an interesting plot line but wasn't written in a complicated way. Sometimes it is possible for a book to be interesting and amazing without it being confusing and having so many gimmicks in order to interest us. One confusion was the fact that the book was split between Tris and Tobias' point of view, yet they were written in EXACTLY THE SAME WAY. I'd find myself re-reading chapters because I got confused in whose point of view I was reading. Another thing that really confused me was the fact that the characters in this book only suddenly thought about what was going on beyond the boundaries of the city of Chicago. So I am supposed to believe that this whole time they have been living in this faction world they haven't wondered what lay beyond the boundaries? Not even once?;1

Read the author's notes for the answer though the beginning of the book introduces us to Uhred as an old man telling his story.That said, I've read everything that Cornwell has written, and highly recommend starting at the first book in each series and working your way through.  I particularly like Uhtred, but also really enjoyed The Archer's Tale, Heretic etc.  Get started and keep going. There is plenty of historic detail (although sometimes as Cornwell points out, he take some liberties).  What is enjoyable for me is his depictions of how people lived during these various periods. Life was certainly brutal and short.;1

223569;This book is pretty much what it says it is: a fable about following your dream.  Coelho pretty much repeats this over and over and over in this book.  At times, it can be pretty trite stuff...beware of sappy words like &quot,Personal Legend,&quot, &quot,Soul of the World,&quot, and other new-agey kind of stuff.  So all that aside, the book was short and to the point, it can be read in one sitting, which is nice, considering that there really is very little plot.  And at times Coelho does write a sentence that really does ring true to life and the choices a person makes.  I think this book would be most appropriate as a high school graduation gift.  If you're like me, 25, and pretty much not at a turning point, it will just seem trite.;1

As many previous readers have warned it WILL keep you up nights when you should really put it down and go to bed to wake up for the morning meeting next day.This story is wonderfully imaginative and intricate. One third of the way into the book (and I'm talking about the Modern Library version with all chapters intact), you wonder why there are so many chapters that ostensibly have little to do with our hero Edmond Dante aka Count of Monte Cristo. The details of where Caderousse end up with La Carconte, the chapters on Luigi Vampa, the chapter on Franz d'Epinay's first encounter with the Count of Monte Cristo? I was slightly baffled as to why Dumas would include them? But I soon understood that every character, no matter how minor, plays some role in the story -- either because they become an important instrument later on in the Count's revenge or they serve to tell us something about the Count (as in Franz d'Epinay's case).From the beginning of the book until Edmond's escape and discovery of the treasure, the reader is well-involved in his story and his life. After he finds fabulous wealth, the reader knows nothing more about this character's inner life. Everything we know about Edmond (and the Count) from then on, is through others. There is a switch in perspective that should have been effective but I found it detracted from the story. Dumas does this of course to convey a sense of mystery surrounding the Count, mystery that is absolutely crucial to his success in gaining revenge. But this sudden break from a mostly single perspective (Edmond's) to many, many perspectives about the Count is distracting, and really breaks the story into two stories rather than one cohesive long tale.The other criticism I have for this book is the amount of repetitive descriptions. I was at times irritated in the beginning at the numerous ""tremblings"" and ""pale with tremblings"" written about Fernand. Later on, Dumas drums into our heads how ""mysterious"" and ""cryptic"" and ""indecphirable"" the Count is. OK, we get it!!Overall, though I can't criticize much a book that kept me up till 2am for 10 solid days. He certainly did something right! The story is well-thought out, intricate as the plot and subplots can be they tie in (sometimes TOO perfectly), and the characters are well-drawn. And just when I catch myself writing the story off as an action-adventure novel, I run across some of the most exquisite and beautifully noted observations on human behavior I've ever read.So suspend your disbelief (some of the hyperbole on the superiority of the Count and the heroism of certain characters made me roll my eyes), believe in love (for Mercedes more than Haydee (????)), forgive some of the incredulous moments (agree about others' questioning of Edmond's readiness to throw away his revenge plans when he was so close to suceeding and his sudden remorse at the end is also a stretch). Put all those little criticisms aside, do NOT see the movie that just came out, read this book! It is worth the time investment and sleepless nights.";1

Just when things are getting really ugly with the local werewolf alpha, Danaus shows up because the time is near for the next naturi sacrifice.  They leave for Machu Picchu, the site where Mira was tortured 500 years ago, and where the naturi tried to open a door to an alternate dimension to free their queen.  Everyone is relying on Mira's fire-starter abilities to fry naturi, but she's also been working on mastering the earth magic that nearly swamped her last time.I hate to be a party pooper, but I think this series is stuck in a rut.  I don't feel like progress is being made from book to book, and I had a strong sense of d&eacute,j&agrave, vu with the plot line.  Like the past two books, Mira and Danaus maintained an uneasy alliance, they skirmished with the naturi, and then they had a big confrontation that Mira barely survives.  Unfortunately it's all become too predictable, and I think the next book needs to break the mold to pull this series back up to the stellar level of the first novel.The ""I'll kill you when this is over"" line has become a running joke between Mira and Danaus, but their relationship is STILL stuck in first gear.  According to the timeline within the story, only one month has passed since they first met, but after three books I've passed antsy and now I'm frustrated.  The lack of build up since their initial encounter is disheartening, and it has taken the edge off any romantic hopes I had for this couple.For all my grumbling, I'm happy to say that Jocelynn Drake has not lost her touch when it comes to the pacing.  The scenes flew by, and I was fully engrossed by the finale, but once again the ending lacked closure.  I appreciate the need to keep things loose for sequels, but I also don't want to read a series that feels like Mira is trapped in a ""Groundhog Day"" scenario.  I'm sorry to say, but this series has moved from one of my `must buys' to a `maybe buy.'";1

244671;By 1825, Soraya had become the Ton's most notorious courtesan.  Hardly anyone realizes that she started only a few years earlier when as an innocent fifteen years old she sold her body to save her impoverished family.  All these years as a kept woman, she prayed after each taking that soon she will escape back to what she once was, Verity Ashton.Soraya knows the time is right for her to vanish as she has the money and is falling in love with her current patron though she fears her kind wealthy benefactor the Duke of Kylemore will not simply allow her to disappear as the insult would be too great for an arrogant soul like him.  Besides she believes Justin Kinmurrie would defy the aristocracy by making her his wife if she let him.  When she runs off, he tracks her down and ignores her plea for his sake to forget her.  Instead he abducts her to persuade his Verity that she would make a fine duchess of Kylemore although most of his peers would disagree, some violently.Though CLAIMING THE COURTESAN may seem like a typical Regency romance, the relationship between the fully developed lead couple turns this into a must read for sub-genre fans.  Soraya is the more fascinating character as she wants to turn back the clock to when she was a simple innocent Verity, but knows that is impossible to achieve, Justin believes that his kisses and his trust will ultimately convince his beloved that she is Soraya in his bed only, but Verity, the Duchess of Kylemore in public.

It's the story of a widowed single mother overcoming grief and moving on with her life.  There's sadness.  There's romance.  There's humor.  Both the story and the writing are excellent.  Fay manages to capture what I think of as perfect ""voice,"" i.e., the characters seem so real.  I hope to see more from this author.";1

The divorce also was in Sullivan's Island. I felt Dot just used the same story and changed a few things. It is time to leave South Carolina and New York and come out with some new ideas.

312348;"The Face Thief by Eli Gottlieb begins with a stunning sequence- one that made me wince and flinch with every excruciating sentence. A woman is falling down the stairs and we get a running narrative of her body's physical trauma. Her orbital orb cracking, rib fracturing - However, in between the descriptions of breaking bones, we get the woman's emotional reaction with memorable, lyrical passages in stark contrast to the painful ones.""Pain had a voice. It spoke to her as she shot off the top step and forward into space, patiently explaining that this was not how her life was supposed to end.""Who is this woman? Who pushed her and why?By the end of the book, we get the simple answers to these questions, but, like the characters, the truth is very complicated.As the cryptic title might imply, the novel is about a thief of property, as well as emotions. Though we find out about the events leading up to the woman's fall, her childhood, and part of her adulthood, we never find out her true name. Instead we are given various names she uses and identities she assumes in different situations, in order to steal something from someone. Each time she wears a different face - innocent child, bright ingenue, trustworthy businesswoman, admirable victim - so convincingly that she is able to manipulate everyone around her.The novel tells the alternating stories of two men this seductive con artist attempts to deceive: one is John, a newlywed of comfortable means who is set up as a relatively cautious, but ultimately easily duped victim of fraud.In fascinating contrast, the other is Lawrence, a psychologist trained in the science of nonverbal psychological ""tells."" He's skilled in instantly discerning lies or concealment, no matter how artful that person is. Lawrence is so successful at what he does that he teaches seminars on how to analyze facial and other physical features for business purposes. If anyone can spot and unmask a con artist, it would be Lawrence.The narrative from his perspective is the most intriguing part of the book. In fact, if such a seminar were offered in real life, I would take it. As I read, I wondered how much of myself I was revealing without saying a word, with every unguarded expression, facial tic, movement, posture, choice of clothes, etc. Our every visible aspect and other subtle clues give away our inner selves, even those desires and fears we're not aware of, let alone those we want to conceal. Anyone skilled in reading the signs would have great advantage, even power, over others.""..[T]hings aren't necessarily what they appear at first...we deal with the liminal...with the partial, the hidden. To the experienced reader, faces and bodies are like a kabbalistic text in which every word stands for something other than what it seems.""The Face Thief is an impressive work of character study. Gottlieb explores the psychological terrain of his subjects in riveting detail. The novel is not so much about which of the con artist's would be victims pushed her, but what makes each of these characters tick and how their secret natures, despite their attempts at self-control, drive them towards their downfalls.Where The Face Thief falters is what happens after the woman wakes up in a hospital and is confronted by the police. The plot, involving incredibly quick, superhuman recovery and police custody which is both supertight and incredibly lax, simply lost me at this point.";1

626929;The Cloud of Unknowing, along with the other works by this humble contemplative, is certainly one of my favourite works in contemplative Christian mysticism, and in itself is also a lovely work of medieval English literature.The writer of the 'Cloud' also wrote several other works, including a translation of Dionysius the Aeropagite's 'Mystical Theology' and other works written for a monk starting his novitiate at the writer's monastary.  The writer was probably a Carthusian monk, and also the spiritual director (or perhaps even the abbot) of a Cathusian monastary in medieval England.The writer had a standard though thorough education and he was influenced by St Thomas Aquinas, Richard of St Victor, and also by Dionysius the Aeropagite.  The writer is an enthusiastic advocate of what is now called the 'via negativa' or the form of theology or mystical contemplation which emphasis the unknowability and 'darkness' of God.The writer counsels his 'spiritual friend in God' to discard any images he has of God, as well as consoling visions and feelings.  The writer urges his student to put a 'cloud of forgetting' between himself and God, and between all creatures and God.  When asked 'What is God' the writer replies 'I don't know' but carefully emphasis while God's essence cannot possibly be known by the human mind, God can be understood and grasped by a 'sharp dart of love' aimed at God.The rest of the writer's works unfold outlining and expanding on these themes, in a brilliantly lucid fashion which avoids any ornaments of rhetoric, condescending spiritual pride, and unneccessary displays of cleverness and erudition.  The Cloud author in fact attacks such people quite strongly, saying they have more in common with the devil than with God, merely learning in order to puff themselves up while completely forgetting their own creator and his amazing gifts.I think the Cloud author is one of the finest mystics in the Christian tradition and all Christians can read this work with enjoyment, and without fear that the mystical is connected with weird ideas of the occult or of pantheistic union with God.  The author takes great pains to attack those who indulge in occult speculations (as perhaps theosophists might today) or in outbursts of hysterics or unbalanced emotion, like Margary Kempe and many other English mystics (and also others in Europe also) sometimes indulged in.  As Thomas Merton wisely said, the mystical path is a calling for all Christians but also an extremely dangerous one, the journey into our interior can easily lead us astray, either by our own self-deceptions, or else through those of the devil.  The author is also careful to emphasize our union with God (unlike Eckhart or Quietists like Margaret Porete) is not one of substance but of loving wills and natures, and there is no fusion of the divine which involves the total and final annihalation of our own being.The tradition the Cloud author follows is firmly rooted in the via negativa.  While this approach and also mysticism generally has come under severe criticism from many quarters recently, I think the Cloud author is certainly one of the most sober and 'safe' mystics in the Christian tradition, and avoids many of the excesses other mystics have fallen into.While some of what the Cloud author says will no doubt have similarities to other religions like Buddhism (especially in meditation), it should be emphasized the Cloud author is firmly Christian in his approach and frequently mentions the necessity of following Christ and also other things like the liturgy and sacraments.  He also frequently refers back to the Bible, and while his biblical references are not as common as those of John of the Cross, 'Biblical' Christians will find this author is careful to keep his ideas within Christian bounds, and to exclude any elements which are clearly foreign to the Christian tradition.  He certainly tones down or ignores for example many of the Neo-Platonic spiritual elements which exist in the system of Denys the Aeropagite.So far as contemplation goes, this little work is a beautiful clear gem, to be treasured as well as admired across the ages.  Certainly when I read this I often feel like the Cloud author is also talking to me, and whenever a writer can do this, you know you have a great writer in your hands.;1

294091;The Domino Men was one of those can't-put-it-down stories, but if you read it at night, you may have to sleep with the light on. This is no fairy tale, the creature that threatens London seems like something that could have been buddies with Cthulhu or Yog-Sothoth, though it had a more prosaic day job, as you will ultimately discover. Our main character is sort of a likeable loser, and, well, don't blame him, blame his Grandpa, who turns out to be a secret agent in a very, very secret agency. There are more twists and turns than a bucket full of slimy eels - and as many cold shivers, too.This book really did make my flesh creep, but I had to find out how it all turned out. The ending wasn't what I expected or even what I hoped, but I didn't feel cheated. There is room for a sequel, but it wouldn't feel unfinished if one never happens. It stands on its own as a fine work of the writer's art as well as a possible future classic of horror.;1

56981;"This is a detailed and uneven biography of an interesting military leader who became a celebrity. The narrative is rich in detail and attempts to both tell Patton's life story in addition to providing an analysis of his personality, leadership style, and provide insight into some of Patton's very nasty prejudices. The verdict appears to be that Patton was an excellent Battle field tactical commander as well as one of the first to recognize the value of the tank and its impact on the battle field. But he had a hard time when it came to understanding the strategy of the larger campaign and being a team player. His anti British, anti Jewish, and anti Russian prejudice impacted his disastrous attempt to govern and de-Nazify Bavaria after the war. And Hirshson points out that the effects of Patton's ""kill the bastard"" speeches was disastrous leading to as many as five atrocities including the murder of civilians. And Patton's famous slapping of the soldiers in the field hospital is well explained from all points of view. So why did Eisenhower put up with Patton? Simply because he won! And victory in total war was more important than style points.I found the early pages of the book most entertaining and interesting as they cover Patton growing up in San Gabriel Valley in Southern California. His father ran for Senate as a Democrat and Patton then married into a rich Conservative (very right wing) family and adopted their views and prejudices as he got older.This is not a great book. For a really great book turn, for example, to William Manchester's ""American Caesar"". American Caesar  demonstrates that Manchester is a most extraordinary writer. Hirshson is not a very good writer. But I do think Hirshson has a lot to offer in his controversial very detailed biography of General Patton. (From reading other reviews posted on Amazon I wonder if I read the same book as many others. Are so many so desperate for a hero without flaws?) I'm glad I never had to serve under someone like the REAL Patton when I was stationed with 14th Armored Cavalry in Germany. Decide for yourself and check this one out.";1

115636;I selected this book for my discussion group based on the fact that it was a Good Morning America Book Club selection.  I'm not a mystery reader, and I have never hear of Philip R. Craig.  Reading through some of the reviews, it seems this isn't one of his best, so I'm disappointed that it was my introduction to the author.  I'm also disappointed in GMA for selecting such a mediocre story as a book club selection.  Unfortunately, my discussion group disintegrated into general bashing of this novel and of the selection of it for the group to read.  I put this out there as a warning to other people who might rely on the GMA recommendation and come looking for some moving literature, instead of bottom barrel genre fiction that gives mysteries a bad name.The narrator is well-known to series fans, but as an outsider, I found him full of himself, with an inflated ego in intellectual and physical matters.  He was unlikeable and I was thoroughly annoyed at having to listen to his point of view by the end of the book.  There was a huge sideline red herring storyline in this book, and it went absolutely nowhere and just made a mess out of the plot.  Perhaps it related to the larger series of books, but in this mystery, it was senseless.;1

196918;Michael Perry is quite clearly a writer - a very good one and well traveled.  In what must rank as a rather peculiar career decision, Perry goes home to the small northwestern Wisconsin town in which he was raised to write, live, and work as a volunteer firefighter.  Population 485 is a collection of essays more or less responding to these experiences.  There is no clear narrative thread and the themes of the essays vary widely.  Each, however, explains in a small way why the small town lifestyle is appealing to many and in a large way the debt we owe as a society to our emergency personnel.  He covers everything from the initial panic of receiving a call to the grim decision to cease lifesaving efforts, and everything from the disappearance of small town main streets to the camaraderie of the volunteer firefighter picnic - deftly mixing deep thinking with the lowest of brows.Too often, in my opinion, books that dwell on small towns are either bitter or saccharine - rarely hitting quite the right spot.  Michael Perry clearly tends toward the sweet end of the spectrum, focusing on the compassionate characters of his small town, often at their best.  He does not, however, write a caricature.  Coming from a small town, though my memories are not so halcyonic, I recognize Perry's characters, their desire to do right and their concern for their neighbor.  And I recognize the worrisome signs of decay - the indications that our small towns are not long for the world, at least in their current form.  Perry has done more good deeds than I can count in his role as an emergency responder, and has done another with his book.  Population 485 is fine writing about regular good guys in a place that's fading.  Population 485 won't change anyone's life, but it's definitely worth the few hours it takes to read.;1
24295;Funny how you get an impression of someone famous by the snapshots you see. Or should I say what the media creates. My idea of Agassi was a brash, flashy kid who started out with long hair, did those Canon commercials, married a model (Brooke Shields).  Sounds good to me. From the outside looking in, fame always seems that way. But all is not as it seems. Agassi was bred by his father to become a tennis star, hours upon hours of practice, sent away to a bootcamp like tennis academy to hone his skills. Throughout the book he claims to hate tennis, this life thrust upon him, no other choices available. This memoir chronicles his struggles and triumphs, how he ultimately came to terms with his profession. Agassi comes across honest and heartfelt, he is not afraid to show all his warts. Their are plenty of suprises along the way, I enjoyed this book, especially the descriptions of the tennis matches, they really are like heavyweight fights, each opponent trading blows with the other. And like all fighters their comes a day when you have to retire and move on to the next phase of life, which Agassi seems to have done quite nicely.;1
156315;"""The Soul of Christianity"" is a book by Huston Smith, otherwise most known for his books on the perennial tradition. Smith's book is relatively short and non-polemical. In fact, he says nothing about the Gnostics and almost nothing about Eckhart, two obvious choices for those who want to harmonize Christianity with the Eastern religions. Nor does he mention the bodily postures of the hesychasts. Instead, Smith claims that the first millennium of Christianity is compatible with the perennial tradition also represented by Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, etc. Weirdly, he claims that Christianity was essentially united during this period. This statement is manifestly wrong. What about Jewish Christians, Gnostics, Arians, Nestorians, Monophysites? At one point, what we call orthodoxy might actually have been a minority position: ""Athanasius contra mundum"".While Smith claims that Christianity is in touch with something objective, something that is really ""there"", independent of our human minds, in practice he divides the Christian religion into two rather distinct spheres. The objective part of Christianity is broadly compatible with Smith's own religious perspective, a version of Advaita Vedanta. The more distinctive Christian dogmas are theological interpretations, and hence in a sense ""subjective"". While some Christians might indeed see their tradition in this manner (I'm sure Origen would have been impressed), many others would argue that the theological interpretations are just as objective, indeed, that they are *more* correct than the general/perennial perspective. Even the irenic C.S. Lewis argued for this more narrow view. The constant conflicts over theological minutiae during the first Christian millennium are a strong argument against Smith's ultra-irenic inclusivism.Smith claims that the Infinite (the unfathomable Godhead) is higher and more fundamental than the Trinity. Further down is the man Jesus, a man who was so imbued with divine love and energy that he perfectly reflected the Godhead. The virgin birth is an allegory, and while the resurrection is in some sense real, Smith emphasizes that it wasn't a resuscitation of a dead corpse but an entirely new form of life. The position is compatible with several different interpretations. Smith also strongly presses the point that damnation in Hell isn't eternal. He is, if not a universalist, at least very close to one. (Here, he is similar to Lewis, at least the Lewis of ""The Great Divorce"".)Among the theological interpretations are: the Incarnation, the Atonement, the virgin birth, the Trinity, Chalcedonian Christology, etc. Smith doesn't claim that these interpretations are ""wrong"", probably because he doesn't have to. Since the unfathomable is always One, while always being expressed in symbols, the author can believe both in his own perennialist perspective and traditional Christian theology. However, this calls for a closer discussion: surely different symbols can express *different* ideas? Why doesn't Smith accept the symbols of Gnosticism or Monophysitism, for instance? Or those of Nestorianism? Conversely, why does he accept Buddhist or Muslim symbols? Why does he sometimes exemplify Jesus' actions by mundane or absurd anecdotes, such as the (admittedly entertaining) story about the shirtless bodybuilder on the beach? If the symbols express something ""objective"", can they really be so diverse as nirvana and the resurrection?On one level, Smith is actually more ""traditional"" than many other metaphysical writers. He says in an interview reprinted in the book that ""The Soul of Christianity"" is a response to Marcus Borg and the Jesus Seminar, who believe that the Gospels are concoctions. Smith believes that the Gospels are true in the sense that they correctly report the impact of Jesus on his disciples. He implies that somehow this impact was objective and that the Gospels therefore aren't completely non-historical. The differences (many would say contradictions) between the four gospels are explained by simply being four different perspectives, all equally true. The divine side of Jesus impacted John in particular, while Matthew was more impacted by the Jewish traits, etc. Of course, even if some of the gospels could be proven to be a hoax, Smith could *still* claim that they are ""true"" in the symbolic sense. At one point, the author retells a somewhat frivolous anecdote about a theologian who asks St. Paul in Heaven whether or not he wrote Ephesians. Paul distractedly responds: ""I think I did"". Smith fills in by saying: ""Who cares?""I suspect neither traditional Christians nor sceptics will like ""The Soul of Christianity"". Somehow, Smith both gets to have his cake and eat it!I'm not a Christian, and I'm not saying that this particular perspective on Christianity is uninteresting. However, it probably wasn't the self-conception of the early Church or most of the Church Fathers. When all is said and done, this book is really the gospel according to...Huston Smith.";1

213533;I read it at least once a year.  I love the story, the atmosphere, and the characters--including Andrea, the main character.  Many reviewers here have found her off-putting, and she certainly is at first.  She's selfish, opinionated and abrasive, not to put too fine a point on it.  But she evolves.  The sharp tongue doesn't completely go away, but she softens--love for Martin softens her, and although she doesn't submit to it willingly, it happens all the same.  There's a haunting incident at the end in which she recognizes and repudiates the way she's tried to control Jim (her brother), has tried to clip his wings, metaphorically speaking.  It sickens her, and she draws back from it.  Her personal growth is one of the reasons I like this book so much.;1
38701;Absolutely loved Divergent, Insurgent also...so I continue and finished the series. I thought the story was well written, thought-provoking and liked the dual POV's. Tris and Tobias grew so much, and the supporting characters all developed into their roles. I would have been happy with a not so happy ending, if it just didn't feel so wasteful. Yes I am a grown woman who for the last several chapters had to read through her tears. So many people that needed to die, IMO, didn't and the few who did left a terrible book wake behind. I really expected some revenge to be played out too. So altogether a good, sound book and ending to a great series, just not the ending I expected or wanted, though a fitting end that manages to stay true with Tris's ideals.;1
536870;This book was a really good.  It is about a boy who is seven years old and lives on a cotton farm.  The town is really small, every one knows each other and there are lots of gossip...ect.  Luke (the boy who is seven)  has a very plain life and dreams of soon becoming a baseball player for the Cardinals. All life is the same until the family hires some workers to pick cotton on the farm.  10 Mexicans and 7 'Hill people'.  This is where the trouble starts.  Fights happen, someone is murdered, secrets revolve in Luke's head, and promises to keep them.  The harvesting starts out the usual way but will end as usual?  Or will a great climax come?  And why is the house being painted white?  Read this book to discover the secrets in Luke's head.This is a really good book since usually I like fantasy and sci fi. It is a good way to read reality and a farm life. The only thing I thought was weird was this boy, Luke, did not really seem 7 he seemed way older.  I know a sever year old and they certainly would not survive picking cotton and keeping secrets of murder.  She can't even write cursive that well.  So overall that is why I would give it a 4, I would feel better if he had been older.  Otherwise this was a really good book and I would recommend it to anyone who likes realistic fiction, or country books.;1

So...in picking up this book, I realized how many untold stories there are and especially about Robert F. Williams.  I found this book to be fascinating, thought-provoking, and honest.  Thank you Dan!;1
279263;Because I a not sure that I have understood all that Wright has included in his treatment of the hope that awaits followers of Christ, I plan to read the book again to see what I may have missed on the first reading.  There is no question that Wright is a genuine scholar and writes about vital issues, but he also writes in straight forward language that is understandable.;1
54657;Like the book that precedes this, the story brings history to life without any sense of it being an historical novel. Just a great story, well written.;1
233168;A century after the outbeak of World War I, saying something about it that was not known before is all but impossible. Neverheless, this is a good book. Clark knows how to write. He shows how complex the issues were, also that none of the participants wanted a European war, let alone the monstrous conflct that eventually resulted. Several, however, were quite prepared to launch what they hoped would be a local or limited war either in order to prevent what they saw as worse things from happening or in order to acheve their goals. And that is how the dice started rolling.;1
410592;I give this 3.75 stars. Not the usual inferno club fare.I enjoyed it, but the love story is a little tame with the ending dialog seeming to be too sappy. It's not a bad story. I feel it's just not the usual fare for the Inferno Club.  Perhaps a little too sedate? Don't get me wrong, any Gaelen Foley story is worth a read.  But to include this story in the inferno club series?  It is missing the intrigue and action of those daring men. I kept waiting for Prometheans to reappear.If your jonesing for a new Inferno Club book you may be a tad disappointed. If you're just wanting another Gaelen Foley romance you'll probably love it.;1
154860;This is the third novel in the Kincaid/James series. In this installment, Duncan has been assigned the case of an apparent suicide, tied to an elite celebrity opera conductor. When it becomes obvious that it isn't a suicide, Duncan and Gemma must determine what really happened.In this novel, the rapport between Duncan and Gemma becomes decidedly more marked.;1
176167;It's not often a romance novel author makes her heroine anyone but a virgin woman, with an untouched past. Alexander takes the risk and gives the reader new twists because of it.;1
640737;Plain and simple..I loved this book!It takes you into the lives of such patient ,simple and appreciative people.Greg's a hero for his unselfish giving to those in need and the understanding that education is of upmost importance if we are ever to have a peaceful world.I highly recommend this book to all readers.All libraries should have a copy and the newspapers should do a review.;1
156459;"I usually enjoy Kinley MacGregor books but after reading the second book in her Avalon Series, I have decided not to buy anymore Lords of Avalon.  The first one was okay, but it did not inspire me to buy the second installment.  However, after seeing the cover and reading the description of the second book I thought it might be better than the first book--it was worse.  I agree with other reviewers about the Monty Python and Spamalot references, there were just too many. I have had limited exposure to Monty Python for a reason--I do not find it funny. Thus I found the book not funny.Also, there were too many characters and alternate realms (it sometimes got confusing) introduced that the hero and heroine got lost and I had to force myself to finish the book.  The storyline got repetitive about how unfairly and horrible everyone in the hero's life treated him--I kept thinking okay already, I get it, the hero's life sucked. Why is he even living in that realm and not living it up as a Hollywood hunk?  Why is he even helping the ""Good Guys"" which I found hard to like and felt they were worst than the ""Bad Guys"" since the Bad Guys are supposed to be bad. Why not live in current earth time away from them and leave saving the world to the ungrateful jerks?  I could have forgiven MacGregor if the book was more comedic than romantic. But the story was NOT romantic, NOT funny, NOT sexy and NOT interesting. Maybe if the setting took place in the present it might have been better since there were so many pop culture references.I use to find MacGregor's books refreshing, but lately the heros of her stories are all beginning to seem the same--whether she's writing under MacGregor or Kenyon. The hero died a horrific death, the hero has a horrific life, the hero was treated horrifically......yada yada yada. I hope her Dream Hunter series proves to be better than the Lord of Ava-yarn I am almost reluctant to buy the book when it comes out in 2007.";1
606717;One of the most influential and important novels ever penned, `Lord of the Flies' may be even more poignant today then when it was initially released.  Telling a very realistic and moving story set in a very unrealistic backdrop `Lord of the Flies' works on almost every level of literature to provide the reader with an all around emotionally gripping experience, and one they won't soon forget.As a plane carrying a group of young children is shot down during warfare the valuable cargo is spread out over an uninhabited island.  The boys quickly must for their own civilization with only a sliver of hope to ever be found.  The story mainly focuses around three very different boys.  Ralph is the chosen leader, a boy who possesses common sense and an open mind.  Piggy is his self-ordained advisor.  He's the smartest of the boys but the most nervous and thus becomes the easiest target for the ruthless.  Jack is one of the more ruthless, a born leader mostly because of his strong presence.  He immediately attaches himself to the idea of hunting and becomes infatuated with the prospect of spilt blood.There's a scene in the novel where Ralph and Piggy lament over not having any adult supervision, not having a grownup tell them the course in which they should plot.  Sitting back after reading this impressive classic and one will realize that adult supervision, or lack there of, was not the problem.  The problem was that these boys grew up way too quickly.  The problems that ensued were a direct result of their acting as adults, pursuing leadership and power and respect and authority.  The clashes between Jack and Ralph and Piggy were all over power, over who had the right to rule and who would follow who.The novel opens with a glimmer of hope, that maybe just maybe with all the innocence in adolescence they may be able to survive in cohabitation without debilitating consequences, but almost immediately those hopes are smashed as the personality traits of the three main characters are uncovered and problems within the group begin to surface.  The conclusion, as grim and tragic as it is, is a conclusion that is almost expected and best left to the readers discovery.`Lord of the Flies' is classic for a reason.  It's brilliant literature with meaning for all of us today.  As we all may know full well, there's a lot we can learn from our children, but sadly, there's a lot our children learn from us that can be detrimental.;1

81644;I had never read this book but have watched the movie for years and years.  So it was a bit of a shock to see nothing like the movie.  I don't know why I was shocked because most movies butcher the books.  It was good though and I recommend it as long as you know what you are getting into.  Don't expect a book to be like the movie.;1
391258;I love this author! the Spindle Cove series is very entertaining. The dialogue was very witty and the premise of the tale was fun and unconventional. Lots of steamy seduction and love scenes spice the adventure of the wounded but strong, alpha hero and the quirky intelligent heroine. Thank you Ms. Dare for not ever disappointing me. My only complaint is that there's too much time between books.;1
340199;"Well, I'm not really surprised by this book, but am disappointed.  It is very much like O'Reilly's TV show.  With a pompousity that makes Rush Limbaugh look humble, O'Reilly attacks everyone. He would say this is because he is fair, but, instead, he really just thinks he is smarter than everyone else.  He fails to see the dangers to our country posed by Barrack Obama.  That he still does not get the message after touring with Glenn Beck shows O'Reilly is a pinhead.  It's not that O'Reilly is an idealogue.  He just is soooo pompous and conceited that he has no respect whatsoever for anyone else or anyone else's ideas(Much like Michael Savage).This gets tiresome quickly.  As a friend of mine says, ""if someone thinks everyone else is a schmuck, that person is a schmuck!""  O'Reilly is a schmuck!";1
295781;"""The Colour of Magic"".  Discworld lies evenly flat on four elephants who ride on the back of a turtle orbiting around the universe.  Tourist Twoflower from the Agatean Empire on the Counterweight Continent has come to Ankh-Morpork to see the famous sights.  Noted loser, drop-out and coward Rincewind the worst wizard is assigned to show the visitor the city or he will lose a few extremities in case he foolishly refuses the kind offer.  When an inferno engulfs Ankh-Morpork Rincewind and Twoflower run for their lives with two many legged luggage.  Thus starts their miscapades.""The Light Fantastic"".  Wizard extraordinaire Rincewind and tourist Twoflower escape the void of space at a time when Discworld appears on a course to collide with a red star that at a minimum would destroy the turtle, four elephants the planet and its residents.  The great minds know that the eight great magic spells will save the turtle, four elephants, the planet and its residents.  Seven spells seem ready for deployment, the eighth resides alone inside the brain of Rincewind.The first two 1980s tales make for a fun graphic novel filled with humor, irony and satire that seems timely as health care for the uninsured, under insured, and economically deprived insured is debated by those who have access to the best in health care on the cheap.  The adaptation is fun as Scott Rockwell captures the essence of the misadventures with great minds who belong in Congress debating the gender of the turtle, Cohen the Barbarian explaining the subtly of combat, and Death learning to play bridge before Bill and Ted.  The graphics illustrated by Steven Ross enhance the belief that Discworld exists though readers will have their own mental images to compare with.  Except for purists, fans of the saga will enjoy this adaptation of the original duology while floating at a turtle's pace through space.Harriet Klausner";1
315026;This book provides a wonderful view of a journey to Kailas.  The history and legends surrounding this holy place are intertwined with the details of present-day pilgrims and the author paints a rich picture of the details of his journey.  What seems to be missing is what drew me to the book in the first place.  It was purportedly a very personal pilgrimage made by the author as a means of dealing with the passing of his mother (and thus, his family).  I felt that the personal connection/motivation was mostly lacking and I was left with a great description of a trip and a history of the region, but very little insight into what the trip meant to the author.;1
590041;If you have never read this, you should.  It is entrancing, a fun yet intelligent read.  I read it about 10 years ago, long after it was originally published, and I have decided to read it again.;1
211308;It's too bad that Ann George was taken from us so soon.  She wrote this book just before she passed away in 2001.  Even though she didn't know that it would be her last book, it actually was a fitting end to the Southern Sisters series.  We have all the wonderful people there, and our two southern sisters that I have fallen in love with as I've been reading the books.  There are 30 Elvis impersonators, a dead body, a missing girl, and anything else that you could want.  Even a wedding at the end.  I recommend this series highly to cozy lovers.  It's the best, and I am going to miss Patricia Ann and Mary Alice very much.  I'll miss Woofer and Muffin too.;1
467640;The Dark HeroineWonderful story about pain, healing, forgiveness, love, and friendship. Add to the betrayal, mystery, humor, and romance and you have a fabulous tale.

363783;"*****""When Shel Silverstein wrote the poem ""Years From Now,"" he seemed to know that one day he'd be gone but that his playful words and images would still be making children happy."" --NPR StaffGenerations of Americans have grown up with the poems of Shel Silverstein, a poet and illustrator, playwright, performer, and popular songwriter. Shel has inspired children to dream and venture to imagine beyond human reach, with the help of beautiful poetry and memorable characters.  Shel Silverstein, was first and foremost a gifted illustrator and an imaginative cartoonist for his poetry collections: A Light in the Attic, Where the Sidewalk Ends, and Falling Up. Although I was not introduced to his early works as a kid, his impressive bare art was mesmerizing before I ever knew his name.Have you ever read a book with everything on it? Silverstein has confessed, ""I never planned to write or draw for kids,"" at the time his popular books were translated into 20 languages, and have sold over 20 million copies! I thought the least is to leave everything in hand (on it) to meditate at the memory of his art and humility. This is a great occasion to review this fine collection of his pen, published twelve years after Shel has departed us in 1999. One hundred and thirty first timer poems and drawings created by the impressive artist and selected by his entourage.I love his rare imaginative funny poetry:""I asked for a hot dog, with everything on it,And that was my big mistake, 'Cause it came with a parrot,A bee and a bonnet, A wristwatch, a wrench, and a rake.. . . . . . .That's the last time I ask, For a hot dog with everything."" S.S.";1
41855;"All the other reviews are right. I mean, anyone who made it this far was so excited after books 2 and 3 that they think there is no way book 4 can be THAT bad. But it is. It falls off a cliff. Either the author is just trying to make more money by extending the series, or he's gotten senile and is out of good ideas, or his publishers forced him into this. Martin even includes a note at the end basically saying ""sorry, the characters you care about will be in the next book."" The entire book is full of new characters and stories we don't care about, and basically NOTHING happens. There is more action in 2 chapters of Book 3 than this entire book. His repetitive style of starting a chapter in the middle of some story, leaving you confused, then explaining the past and filling in the holes through a narrative or dream, gets very old very quick. The only characters you remotely care about *SPOILER ALERT* include Arya, Sam and the Cersei/Jaime/Brienne plot. I finished the book and still am not sure what happened to Arya. She went from place to place, narrowly missed learning about her family and rejoining them, then prayed in a temple and sold some clams. Sam leaves the wall to become a maester and rides a boat. Jaime can't fight, Cersei's a scheming b*tch and Brienne is still a failure. The rest of the book is the Greyjoys and the Dornes, whom no one cares about, and Sansa stuck with that whiney brat Vale kid. End book. It almost made me NOT buy dance of dragons, but after reading 10,000 pages to get this far, I can't stop now.  I'm stuck. He should've had an epilogue in book 3 of Dany and Jon riding dragons wearing crowns side by side and ended it. Thanks for nothing Martin.";1
63238;"I got Huston Smith's ""Islam"" for a church study group.  The book had been recommended by one of the study group pariticpants and by a professor acquaintance who uses Smith's book in a survey of world religions.  Both gave it very good reviews.  And so do I.  The Introduction is especially key to understanding why all who are unfamiliar with Islam--or those who know only what they've gleaned from the media since 9/11 should learn about it.  Smith's Prologue explains why Islam is so important an element of the Judeo-Christian traditions in the West.  Smith uses cogent citations from a variety of sources to underscore his commentary and understanding of Islam.  The subtitle, ""A concise Introduction"" is to be taken seriously, every word in this book counts.  A beauty of this book is that Smith presents a faith that we in the West consider exotic and foreign, yet is born of Abraham as are Judaism and Christianity.  Something I learned that made this short book so useful for me is that he explains clearly why the Koran is so often misunderstood and why translations seem to be a clutter of chopped up sentences that seem not to hold together.  It almost makes one want to learn Arabic so as to fully appreciate Islam as a faith and way of life.  No, no, I have no intention of converting, but Smith's book has helped me understand my own Christian faith far more clearly.";1
208400;"This book *should* keep you racing for the ending.  But then again, you've got nothing to show for the ride.  The ending is rather choppy and leaves the feeling of ""Well?? And?""The use of first person was a bad idea. For example, when the narrator is in danger, you know he has to live. Because there would be no book without the narrator, he has to survive.  That really cuts down on the suspense.One thing that really annoyed me about Prey was the continuous way of explaining things that ordinary people not involved in biology/nanotechnology/genetic fields wouldn't know.  First, Jack (the narrator and pseudo-hero) has a little chat and speaks in indecipherable language for about a page and half.  Then another page and a half explains what the heck the two characters were talking about.  And so it continues: Dialogue-explain, dialouge-explain, etc.The plot itself has huge holes and is very Stephen King-esque.  A mystery/horror/this-is-going-to-happen-someday-and-your-job-is-to-prevent-is prevalent throughout the novel.OK, but not the best Crichton out there.";1
569034;This book is a good source to make someone aware of the power of communication and how words can make things better or far worse.  I don't know if it's a how to manual more than a series of anecdotes and examples.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who does public relations work or who is involved in sensitive negotiations in politically charged environments where the stakes are high and where a misplaced or poorly word can derail progress or make it come to a screeching halt.;1
159193;A book about a guy and a dog. Far from original, the dysfunctional descriptions of the human/animal relationships had me quickly putting this book down.Do yourself a favor. Skip this one.;1

317431;Christopher Moore is a blessing to the written word. As an artist it was exciting the way he can weave fact with fiction.  As always, a very exciting read.;1
534050;Excellently written historical info. on the importance of a substance many take for granted.  The writer links together, past and present and trails the manners in which salt has been gathered and it extreme importance in the rise and fall of nations!;1
530654;As one of the authors, I must confess bias.  This one addresses Darwin's life, from a Discworld viewpoint (for the Darwin year).... On Roundworld. the Rev Charles Darwin writes a very successful book, but the wrong one: Theology of Species.  The Discworld wizards have to sort out this issue, make him get on to the Beagle, introduce him the the Discworld God of Evolution, etc., and are finally successful!!  Not as good as No II, The Globe, in my view, but pretty dam good all the same!;1
94349;this was a great book as  thoroughly enjoyed  it.  what a woman of grace and charm....skilled rider.  the pictures are absolutely wonderful.  she was able to pass her skill and passion to her children.  great coffee table book.  i am so happy to be able to own this magnificent book.;1
240844;This is a very well written book and the research is exhaustive to say the least.  There are a number of chapters that could make for excellent books on their own without much help. I do think Andrew Roberts does some things very well but also makes some critical errors which keep a work of this magnitude from being a classic.  One thing he does well is that he clearly demonstrates the full extent of Soviet suffer.  Most importantly his use of average people is very well done and really brings the war into focus.  His research is very deep and complete and is excellent.There are several weaknesses in this book that nearly disable it.  For one it is far to Euro-centric to be a true history of the entire war.  The battles in the Pacific hardly rate a mention. There is no mention of the hard fights of Guadalcanal or the tragedy that was Saipan.  I would say that the Sicily campaign rates more coverage than the entire American counteroffensive in the Pacific.  Robert's greatest weakness is that he, like most British histories of the war, is loath to admit any American contribution to victory other than producing large quantities of material, put to good use by the British and Russians.  He also seems more interested in analyzing why German lost the war, as if it where theirs to lose.All in all it's a well-research decent history of the war but far from authoritative.;1
404089;Well done and very educational. Few have actually read Darwins actual book so this exposing one to his own doubts within his very book itself.;1
5363;The book was interesting...but like book 4 the story ends abruptly. It is starting to be a joke...if I have to wait 5 years for another half baked story I am going to put the series out if mind until it is completed. Hopefully Martin doesn't drop dead before he decides to finish...like Jordan.  Don't get me wrong I love both authors...they just set the bar high so they are judged harshly.;1
338514;This book is interesting. But I can honestly say there is no new news in the information within. I think the press hammered so no new stones were unturned.;1
